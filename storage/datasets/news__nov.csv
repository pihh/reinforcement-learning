7218,228733,NOV,U S  shale firms cut budgets  staff as oil price outlook dims,news,"By Jennifer Hiller and Liz Hampton
ODESSA  Texas  Reuters    Oil producers and their suppliers are cutting budgets  staffs and production goals amid a growing consensus of forecasts that oil and gas prices will stay low for several years 
The U S  has 904 working rigs  down 14  from a year ago  and even that is probably too many  estimated Harold Hamm  chief executive of shale producer Continental Resources  N CLR   which has reduced the number of rigs at work 
Bankruptcy filings by U S  energy producers through mid August this year have nearly matched the total for the whole of 2018  A stock index of oil and gas producers hit an all time low in August  a sign investors are expecting more trouble ahead 
 For a graphic on debt from energy bankruptcy filings by year  see here  
 You re going to see activity drop across the industry   Earl Reynolds  CEO of Chaparral Energy  N CHAP   told Reuters at the EnerCom oil and gas conference last month 
The Oklahoma energy firm has slashed its workforce by nearly a quarter  trimmed its spending plan by 5   and agreed to sell its headquarters and use some of the proceeds to reduce debt 
Investment bank Cowen   Co estimated last month that oil and gas producers spent 56  of their 2019 budgets through June  based on its review of 48 U S  companies  It expects total spending this year to fall 11  over last year  based on proposed budgets 
The slowdown in drilling is spurring cost cutting in oilfield services  including staff cuts and restructurings at top firms Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co  Schlumberger plans a writedown yet to be determined this quarter  noting its results in North America have been  under significant pressure   CEO Olivier Le Peuch said on Wednesday 
Halliburton is paring its North American workforce by 8  because of customer spending cuts  and National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  recently offered buyouts to its U S  workers 
 The service sector I think is going to be flat   said Superior Drilling Services CEO Troy Meier  whose firm canceled plans to add new machinery 
Such signs of a downturn come as the shale sector had just started generating the cash flow long demanded by investors  who have grown weary of drilling expansions without returns  Last quarter  a group of 29 top publicly traded producers generated more in cash    26 million   than it spent on drilling and dividends  according to  Morningstar   O MORN  data provided by the Sightline Institute and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis  A year earlier  the same group had spent  2 4 billion more than it generated 
Despite that progress  many small to mid sized shale firms are now pulling back on production targets amid the gloomy price projections 
A slowing oil industry could weigh on the United States economy  The boom in shale oil output added about 1 percent to U S  gross domestic product  or 10  of growth  between 2010 to 2015  according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  In Texas  the center of shale oil production  energy employment dipped 1 8 percent in the first six months of 2019  according to the Dallas Fed  New drilling permits in the state fell 21  in July compared with the same month last year  according to state data 
MAJORS STAY THE COURSE
Any broader economic impact  however  could be limited by the massive investments in shale drilling by some of the world s biggest oil firms    Exxon Mobil   N XOM    Chevron   N CVX   Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  and  BP  PLC  L BP   Even as small and mid sized firms dial back  the majors continue to pour billions of dollars into years long shale drilling plans  They have argued their integrated well to refinery networks allow them to control costs enough to withstand a sustained period of low prices 
Spokespeople for Exxon  Chevron and BP declined to comment on the industry downturn but referred to previous statements of their longterm commitment to shale  Shell did not respond to requests for comment 
Chevron has focused much of its production growth plans on shale  and CEO Michael Wirth has called its Permian Basin holdings in West Texas and eastern New Mexico the  highest return use of our dollars  
Exxon CEO Darren Woods told a  Barclays   LON BARC  energy conference on Sept  4 that the company continues to take the long view 
 The way we look at the business is tied to some very basic fundamentals that haven t changed for decades  if not hundreds of years   he said  noting it took oil a century to replace coal as the world s dominant energy source 
Exxon has estimated it can earn a double digit return in the Permian Basin even if oil falls to  35 a barrel 
BRACING FOR LOW PRICES
U S  oil prices largely have traded just above  50 a barrel since last November  requiring higher output to generate the same profit as when prices were higher  Prices this quarter are about 18  lower than this time last year  according to U S  government data 
U S  oil prices are likely to remain below  55 a barrel for the next three years  said Scott Sheffield  CEO of  Pioneer Natural Resources   N PXD   one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin  Lackluster prices will result in a  significant fallback in Permian growth  and probably  no growth for most   he said on a recent earnings call 
Part of the slowdown comes as the best drilling spots in some areas of the field are being  exhausted at a very quick rate   Sheffield said 
The severity of the looming downturn is a matter of debate 
 Flotek Industries Inc   N FTK   a supplier of oilfield chemicals  has cut staff twice this year  CEO John Chisholm told Reuters that the industry is just  pumping the brakes  as it grapples with well design issues 
Matt Sallee  a portfolio manager at energy investors Tortoise Capital  expects a longer industry decline 
 It s hard to see how this gets any better for several quarters   he said ",2019-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-shale-firms-cut-budgets-staff-as-oilprice-outlook-dims-1972034,1972034

 Reuters    U S  oilfield equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco  N NOV  on Friday called the coronavirus a  wildcard  in the oil industry s outlook  with an extended outbreak potentially hurting access to Chinese make materials and foreign sales 
The Houston based company said further shutdowns at its Chinese suppliers could limit its production of certain products such as fiberglass resins and drilling pipe 
For now  National Oilwell has the latitude to make up lost ground  executives added  noting it has a diversified supply chain 
  There is  still a lot of uncertainty related to the extent to which this will impact operations   Jose Bayardo  chief finance officer  said on an earnings call with investors 
China also is a growing market for its products  he said 
Chief Executive Clay Williams  NYSE WMB  added that he was equally concerned about the virus  impact on global oil demand  which could affect its oil and gas customers  National Oilwell is one of the largest suppliers of oil drilling equipment 
An outbreak of the coronavirus in China has roiled commodity markets in recent weeks  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are weighing additional output cuts as demand for crude oil falls

161369,382885,NOV,National Oilwell Varco Overcame a Shifting Oil Market to Post Solid Q4 Results,news,"Oil field equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  continues to battle challenging conditions in the oil market  While that put some pressure on its fourth quarter financial results  the company posted decent numbers overall  which is evident especially after digging deeper into the report 
Drilling down into National Oilwell Varco s fourth quarter results

Data source  National Oilwell Varco  
At first glance  National Oilwell Varco reported mixed Q4 results  While its revenue rose 7  compared with the third quarter  it declined 5  year over year  Meanwhile  the company posted a much wider net loss versus both periods 
But upon closer inspection  the numbers look a lot better  That s because its net loss was entirely the result of recording  537 million of noncash  pre tax restructuring and impairment charges stemming from the slowdown in U S  onshore drilling activities  That masked the fact that the company s underlying profitability as measured by adjusted EBITDA was  288 million  an increase of  26 million sequentially and  9 million year over year 
A major driver of that improvement was the company s completion and production systems segment 

Revenue in that business group rose 10  versus the third quarter  which was the third consecutive period of double digit sequential growth  and 1  year over year  The improvement was a result of growing demand in offshore and international markets  which more than offset rapidly declining demand for completion equipment in the U S  onshore market 
The uptick in sales helped fuel a 17  sequential increase in this segment s adjusted EBITDA  though earnings fell 14  year over year  Another positive was that National Oilwell Varco booked  502 million of new orders  which was slightly higher than the  499 million of orders it shipped out of the backlog during the period  implying that revenue should continue rising 
The rig technologies segment posted a mixed quarter  While revenue rose 17  sequentially  it fell 6  year over year  Driving the uptick in sales from the third quarter was an increase in land rig deliveries and improved progress on offshore equipment projects  Adjusted EBITDA  meanwhile  rose 7  sequentially and 10  year over year  However  the company only booked  211 million of new orders during the quarter  which was well below the  360 million of orders shipped out of its backlog and could weigh on revenue growth in the future 
The wellbore technologies segment  meanwhile  posted weaker revenue both sequentially  down 4   and year over year  down 14    Driving the decline were lower drilling activity levels in North America  which more than offset the improving conditions in offshore and international markets  Adjusted EBITDA in the segment did improve 8  from the third quarter  though it fell 8  versus last year s Q4 

What National Oilwell Varco s management had to say
CEO Clay Williams commented on the company s results in the earnings press release   The fourth quarter saw continued improvements in international and offshore markets  partially offset by another sequential decline in spending by our customers in North America  While this mix shift affects each of our segments differently  all three of our operating segments were able to deliver sequential improvements in adjusted EBITDA  
One of the drivers of the earnings improvements was the company s success in pushing down costs last year  As a result  National Oilwell Varco was able to  significantly improve cash flow and strengthen our balance sheet  despite the financial charges that were necessary through the year   according to Williams  It ended the year with  1 17 billion in cash against  1 99 billion in total debt  That cash rich balance sheet gives the company the financial flexibility to navigate through the choppy oil market 
Tough but manageable
National Oilwell Varco continues to battle challenging industry headwinds  The company is doing a solid job overall  as its revenue and underlying earnings improved during the fourth quarter  thanks in part to cost cutting and its ability to quickly capture offshore and international opportunities as they arose  The energy company s ability to adapt  when combined with its strong balance sheet  gives it an edge over the competition in the ever changing oil market ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psl8u,2079546

nearest corresponding GAAP measures in our earnings release available on our website  On the US GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2019  NOV reported revenues of  2 28 billion and a net loss of  385 million or  1 01 per share  Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning s call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our earnings release  Later in the call  we will host a question and answer session  Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up to permit more participation Now let me turn the call over to Clay Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Blake  NOV s results continue to improve sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2019 as revenue increased 7  from the third quarter and EBITDA increased to  288 million or 12 6  of revenue  Despite continued deterioration of the North American market  all three of our segments increased EBITDA sequentially  On a year over year basis  NOV was able to post an increase in EBITDA during the fourth quarter of 2019 despite revenue being down more than  100 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  Aggressive cost reductions and facility downsizing contributed significantly to NOV s improving financial performance and Jose and I will speak more to this in just a moment Revenues for the full year 2019 were  8 48 billion  a 0 3  improvement from the prior year  Full year EBITDA of  885 million declined 3  from the prior year  2019 was a pivotal year for the energy industry  We entered 2019 with commodity and equity markets signaling strongly to market participants that growth for growth sake without commensurate returns to capital providers would no longer be tolerated  Sources of all forms of capital to the industry  public equity  private equity  bank debt  public debt became scarce and expensive as evidence for example by the collapse in trading multiples of oilfield public equities in early 2019 At the time we interpreted this as the evaporation of a widely held narrative  gauzy conventional wisdom that a commodity price spike would someday soon lead us back to a more prosperous oilfield and save us all  Through the first four years of the downturn 2015 to 2018  this narrative was responsible  we think for a significant structural option value component in equities and asset values in the oilfield  This makes sense to me because the oil and gas industry has a 160 year history of extreme volatility and sophisticated investors recognize the corresponding option value that goes with this volatility as the leading provider of capital intensive capital equipment to oilfield service companies  we tend to watch such trends  Our customers frequently rely on external capital to buy the equipment that we provide them  And by the beginning of 2019 providers of external capital to oil and gas producers and service companies were exhausted  tired of waiting patiently for recovery that felt like you continued to slip over the horizon  So they choked back on the capital that they were previously pumping into the operations of our customers Our capital is to oil and gas what oxygen is to the rest of us  Petroleum is arguably the most capital intensive undertaking of all industrial enterprises and oilfield services is probably second  Operators react quickly when you choke off their air supply  They pulled back hard on capex budgets  particularly in the US unconventional plays  resulting in a peak to trough decline of 27  in the US land rig count over the course of the year  while International and offshore projects with favorable return characteristics continued to receive FID green lights  The industry as a whole  particularly the US  finally seem to be resigning itself to the fact that commodity price spike is not going to save the day and the old way of doing business is not going to cut it  It will unfortunately be lower for longer and as the new conventional wisdom that emerged at the beginning of 2019 I wanted to step through this perspective with you this morning  because I believe it has important implications for our company and our industry over the next few years and this perspective has guided our strategic decisions through 2019  First  with respect to the elusive recovery  through this year of capital austerity  some might say capital starvation  I ve been struck by the number of conversations I have had with other oil patch all timers  Phonetic  where we agree that this lack of capital is as bad as anytime we saw during the 1980s or 1990s  They re in light of seeds of a return to prosperity because the new grim view that has taken hold is now driving the industry to reduce its structural overcapacity  taking actions that will return this industry to health  asset retirements  facility closures  regional withdrawals  exits from businesses and consolidations got under way in earnest in 2019  while individually  none of these will heal the space  collectively they inevitably lead the industry to better disciplined pricing and shareholder returns NOV shared the task began materially back in 2015 when we started reducing our overcapacity facilities footprint and SG A  but our efforts were accelerated sharply beginning in 2019 as a reality of the new market normal became apparent  Our team has undertaken many difficult decisions including pulling back from unprofitable markets and closing numerous facilities around the world  some of which had been NOV mainstays for decades  Since 2015  we have closed 483 facilities to shrink our own internal capacity to better fit market demand  We ve adopted a more efficient shared services model in many regions and through the hard work of our team through this past year we ve established a clear and tangible path to at least  230 million in annual cost savings as compared to the first quarter of 2019  Thus far we have obtained approximately  170 million in annualized savings  up about  82 million sequentially in the fourth quarter  And we continue to evaluate every opportunity to increase that number Second  every product line no matter how well established has fallen under the microscope of an in depth returns analysis  Those do not currently meet our internal threshold have either developed a tangible plan for near term improvement or have been slotted for divestiture or closure  Ultimately 2019 was a year about building and solidifying our staying power  Operationally  we re leaner  more efficient and more agile to react to the shifts in the market  Third from a balance sheet perspective  we continue to increase the strength of our capital structure in order to maintain the flexibility to act opportunistically  During the fourth quarter  we called  1 billion in debt due in 2022 repaying a portion with cash and a portion with longer tenor notes  a new    in a new issue that is due 2029 Fourth  we tailored our strategy to fit a world where oilfield services customers have limited access to capital  Commercially NOV won much of this race during the period from 2006 to 2014 when we won a significant portion of the largest build out of oilfield service equipment  the industry has seen in a generation  We deliver 379 offshore new build drilling packages since 2006  for instance  So today we benefit from having the largest installed base of oilfield equipment in the world  This enormous installed base gives rise to new  attractive business opportunities that are unique to NOV  Aftermarket spares and services support  software system enhancements  the application of big data driven predictive analytics products to drive efficiencies  the evolution of mechanization to automation of processes in the oilfield for instance We are creating differentiated digital offerings built on over three decades of gathering big data in the oilfield through our M D Totco products and eHawk service offerings  among others  Due to our installed base of equipment that touches nearly every well site in the world  we re uniquely positioned as perhaps the only common thread between hundreds of unique equipment suppliers with thousands of non standardized sensor tags Our new product development with capital scarce and oilfield equipment oversupplied it makes less sense for oilfield service contractors to spend millions of dollars on new units  rather we see the next attractive opportunities as being smaller dollar investments that our customers can make in bigger impact enhancements that will enable them to differentiate their equipment in a crowded market place  While there will be certain large new build project opportunities that arise  even in this tough market  we will remain disciplined and will choose not to follow our competitors in doing the stupid stuff that desperate competitors inevitably do  A strong balance sheet and a large installed base of equipment requiring ongoing OEM support is the best way to write out an industry downturn  The good news for NOV is that we have both New product development has zeroed in on bolt on products that carry a price tag our customers can afford  with value added efficiency or useful life improving profile that they can justify to their shareholders  I think in terms of track ID tags for drill pipe monitoring and auto tally s on rigs  NOVOS operating system enhancements that our customers can charge their oil company customers for  New directional drilling tools like SelectShift  which have no similar peer in the marketplace  PowerBlade energy management systems  which reduce diesel consumption and carbon footprint for offshore drillers  Affordable products which can be used to retrofit existing capacity to improve its attractiveness in the marketplace Lastly  with respect to our outlook for the year  We re prepared to endure continued levels of reduced activity in North America with a meaningful market recovery unlikely to take hold before 2021  The kind of market that suits affordable fit for market solutions  International activity continues to be a bright spot as we enter 2020 for NOV as customers in the Middle East and other regions around the world look to harness the technologies that enable the US unconventional revolution  Where our rig technology segment is experiencing limited demand for new equipment in North America  we re scheduled to deliver multiple new rigs and rig upgrade packages this year to the Middle East as several countries in the region seek to upgrade their fleets  We are pleased with our progress on our Saudi joint venture and expect to begin delivering the first 50 modern highly efficient super spec rigs to the kingdom in 2021 Offshore drilling and production continues to grow at a measured pace  Our Wellstream processing business  an industry leader in production processing technologies  including monoethylene glycol regeneration units is tendering at twice the pace that it was at this time last year  indicative of greater activity in the offshore  As the world continues to learn more about the coronavirus outbreak  we re hopeful  first  that authorities around the globe were able to ease the suffering that is causing so many  We also hope that its impact on the world s economy broadly and the oil and gas industry specifically is short lived  but we re realistic in acknowledging that globalization leaves us exposed to market uncertainty as it does for other industries  We expect our scale and global footprint will help us mitigate any direct supply chain repercussions but the situation nevertheless remains fluid in early 2020 Finally  before I hand it over to Jose  I d like to finish where I began  If I ve learned anything from business it s to be skeptical of conventional wisdom  because collectively we are all well frequently wrong  I would be surprised to see a robust global recovery emerge in the oilfield in 2020 or even 2021  so we are managing the business accordingly  However  I do think a recovery will emerge when no one is predicting it  The only facts I know for certain is that the oil industry has seen global growth in demand for almost every single one of its 160 years  and that the industry has always been highly cyclical  The current time feels an awful lot like the 1990s  when then as now  capital providers to oil and gas were fatigued and frustrated  another period of capital starvation  And then as now the industry responded by trimming overcapacity  History doesn t repeat itself  but it does rhyme and I m encouraged that here in the sixth year of the downturn  the oil and gas industry are serious about reducing it s structural oversupply There is a parallel narrative embedded in conventional wisdom about a looming energy transition  One that fully displaces fossil fuels and therefore one that likely further diminishes the option value of oilfield assets at least in the minds of some investors  While I m confident   Indecipherable  will transition to better forms of energy in the future  the shape and pace of that transit    transition are probably going to surprise us all  In the near term oil and gas remain critical fuels that play a key role in  for instance  air travel and feeding the planet  So they will be part of the energy mix for many years  perhaps generations to come  Nevertheless  an energy transition is emerging as potentially the most valuable and interesting business opportunity of the 21st century  So  there is one more small  but important element to our strategy  which is figuring out how NOV can capitalize on this and how we can make money by facilitating it  We quietly launch this initiative a few years ago to play offense rather than defense against this emerging backdrop We re not spending much money in this area  but I have been very encouraged by what our teams are developing and I hope to be able to share more with you on future calls about the opportunities emerging for NOV in this space  To our employees listening around the world  thank you for all that you do  your resiliency  your dedication  your hard work made a tough year a great year for NOV and Jose and I could not be more thankful to have you on our team With that  I ll turn it over to Jose Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Clay  NOV s consolidated revenues increased  155 million to  2 28 billion or 7  sequentially as the continued momentum in International and offshore markets helped drive a 15  sequential improvement in international revenues  more than offsetting the impact of a rapid decline in North American activity levels during the fourth quarter  EBITDA increased  26 million sequentially to  288 million  driven by strong operational performance and continued progress on cost savings initiatives  partially offset by favorable project closeout variances from Q3 not repeating and a less favorable product sales mix in our Completion   Production Solutions and Rig Technology segments As Clay mentioned  we continue to make progress on efforts to rightsize our business and improve efficiencies across the organization and expect to realize another  24 million in annualized cost savings in the first quarter or a  6 million improvement in Q1 over Q4  We ve also been reducing the working capital intensity of our business  We converted  246 million of working capital to cash in the fourth quarter and generated  473 million in cash flow from operations  After deducting  67 million of capital expenditures  free cash flow for the quarter was  406 million  bringing our second half 2019 free cash flow to  689 million  significantly exceeding our target Despite our expectation  the capital expenditures for NOV will increase to around  325 million in 2020 as we ramp spending on our new rig manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia  We believe we will increase free cash flow by at least  100 million year over year and that working capital will be a source of cash for NOV in 2020 During the fourth quarter  we took measures to further strengthen our balance sheet by redeeming  1 billion of senior notes due December 2022 and issuing  500 million of new senior unsecured notes due 2029  These transactions extended the maturity of  500 million of existing debt by seven years and reduced our debt by approximately  500 million  leaving us with  1 989 billion in gross debt as of December 31  Cash flow generated in Q4 allowed us to reduce net debt to  818 million at year end  Our actions demonstrate what we ve long said that defending the balance sheet is our top capital allocation priority  Our actions are designed to ensure NOV can successfully manage tumultuous market conditions and provide the flexibility to be opportunistic with compelling high return investments that we may identify As you know NOV has a share buyback authorization that is contingent on the company achieving gross debt to annualized EBITDA of less than 2 times  If 2020 continues to unfold as we expect  we will likely begin stock buybacks later in the year  A few housekeeping items before we dive into our segment level results  During the fourth quarter  we took  537 million in mostly non cash impairment and other charges due to the further deterioration in North American market conditions in our ongoing restructuring efforts  Lower intercompany sales from cross segment projects resulted in a  3 million sequential decrease in revenue eliminations  In the first quarter of 2020 we expect intercompany sales to remain in line with the fourth quarter of 2019 Other expenses increased  44 million sequentially and included  26 million in expenses associated with the retirement of  1 billion of our 2022 notes  and a  14 million increase in foreign exchange losses  And finally  while our effective tax rate may continue to be volatile over the near future  we expect our tax rate will average approximately 35  for 2020 Moving to results from operations  Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated  764 million revenue in the fourth quarter  a decrease of  29 million or 4  sequentially  Revenues from North America declined 13   slightly more than the fall off in drilling activity  While revenues from the segment s international operations increased 7   Despite the decline in revenue  EBITDA for the segment increased by  10 million sequentially to  143 million primarily due to the successful implementation of cost savings initiatives and structural improvements to operational efficiency across the business units in this segment Our ReedHycalog drill business posted a less than 1  decline in revenue due to continued weakness in the North American market that was mostly offset by growth in most international markets and continued market share gains in the US  Our high performing bits are allowing us to gain share and preserve pricing in a competitive market  Revenues in our Downhole business unit fell 12  as reduced demand and increased pricing pressures in the North America were partially offset by higher revenues in most Eastern Hemisphere markets  despite the challenges in the North American market we continue to see healthy demand for our leading edge motor elastomer and other technologies including our SelectShift adjustable motors  which are enabling customers to complete single run wells with greater consistency and reliability During the fourth quarter  we helped the customer in the Marcellus Basin drill a record setting 19 132 foot single run well  Our M D Totco business unit realized a slight increase in revenue as the contribution from our growing number of drilling automation projects and the Norwegian North Sea more than offset a decline in revenue for M D Totco s business in North America  Our Tuboscope business units saw revenues fall 5  sequentially  Revenue from the business units coating operations were down slightly and inspection service revenues fell 6  as lower drilling activity levels in the US and holidays reduced output from mills and outside processors Revenues in our WellSite Services business unit declined 12  sequentially on fewer US fluids jobs  but the units core solids control business only experienced a 5  sequential decrease in revenues  It s US operations performed in line with the 11  fall off in drilling activity that was partially offset by growing opportunities in International and offshore markets We re encouraged to have begun working on several projects in the Gulf of Mexico recently  in addition to seeing rising demand overseas  Our Grant Prideco drill pipe business realized a sharp increase in revenues in the fourth quarter as we shipped large volumes of high spec drill pipe for international markets  Additionally  as was the case in the third quarter  more than 50  of the business units revenues were derived from offshore products  while orders for drill pipe in the US have been sparse over the past few quarters  customers drill pipe inventories that we hold in the US are at the lowest levels in recent history  We believe any material increase in drilling activity will require a healthy increase in orders Meanwhile  as international customers restock diminish inventories  we continue to see rising demand for our Delta drill pipe connection technology  Looking to Q1 for the Wellbore Technologies segment the coronavirus  oil prices  seasonality and evolving E P budgeting practices all remain wild cards  but at this time  we expect revenues for our Wellbore Technologies segment will decline between 6  to 12  with decremental margins in the mid 30  range Our Completion   Production Solutions segment generated  799 million in revenue in the fourth quarter  an increase of  71 million or 10  sequentially  Growing demand from offshore and international markets was partially offset by lower demand for completion equipment in US land markets  EBITDA increased  14 million sequentially to  96 million or 12  of sales  Incremental margins were limited to 20  as modestly higher sequential cost savings were offset by favorable credits related to the close out projects in Q3 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter  Segment began realizing a considerable increase in orders during late 2018  largely driven by offshore and international projects  This trend continued to the fourth quarter resulting in orders of  502 million and its fifth straight quarter with a book to bill in excess of 100   While the project pipeline remains robust for 2020  at this point  we expect lower orders in the first quarter due to the timing of specific projects Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit posted an 8  sequential improvement in revenues  achieving the highest levels of revenue in its history  Increased deliveries of spoolable pipe from our new manufacturing plant in Dammam  Saudi Arabia and marine scrubber system components needed to retrofit vessels for IMO 2020 compliance  drove the sequential growth but was partially offset by rapidly contracting demand in North America where orders decreased 15  sequentially  We expect the need for additional scrubber systems to remain robust with experts estimating that owners of shipping vessels can achieve paybacks on their investments in less than a year based on current price spreads between low sulfur and traditional bunker fuel Our Intervention and Stimulation equipment business realized a 3  sequential increase in revenue on strong year end shipments of coiled tubing and wireline units  However  margins decreased roughly 100 basis points on a less favorable product mix as revenues from pressure pumping aftermarkets parts and services declined to a level that is less than half its recent highs  Results from this business unit remain depressed due to the structural overcapacity of the North American completions market  However  the business continues to advance it s technological leadership by assisting our customers and finding new less capital intensive ways to improve profitability for themselves and their end customers Our FracMaxx  Big Bore  QuickLatch and frac hose products are examples that are lower cost solutions for improving operational efficiencies and safety in a cash constrained environment  Business is also focused on pursuing opportunities in other markets such as the Middle East  Latin America and China where the development of tight and unconventional natural gas formations is driving equipment needs that mirror what is used in North America In the fourth quarter we booked and delivered a large package of high pressure equipment to an operator in Northwestern China  where there has been a rapid increase in the amount of hydraulic fracturing activities  and as therefore experiencing a corresponding increase in demand for high pressure Flowline equipment in the Chongqing and Jiangyin gas fields Our Process and Flow Technologies business unit realized revenue growth in each of the unit s major product lines  The unit s production midstream product offerings saw a sequential decrease in demand in North America that was more than offset by large shipments of pump packages to India and an uptick in sales of production chokes  including the first batch of chokes built in our new manufacturing facility in Dammam  Saudi Arabia Business unit also realized its third straight quarter of improved results from its offshore market focused Wellstream Processing and APL mooring product offerings  primarily driven by growing LNG related activity  Headlining the order book was a monoethylene glycol regeneration and reclamation unit for an LNG project in Mozambique and in order for our newly developed electrostatic coalescer technology EPACK that will be installed at the Equinor  Johan Sverdrup Tendering activity for the offshore market remains the strongest in recent memory  which is reflected in the business  ability to post a book to bill in excess of 150  and which should begin to allow for incremental pricing improvements during the year  Our subsea flexible pipe business posted a 15  sequential increase in revenues  but at low flow through as the market for flexible pipe remains very price competitive Bookings improved from the third quarter generating a book to bill of 134  and included more than 56 miles of flexible pipeline systems for a project in the North Sea  Our team continues to use as technology advantages to focus on higher value add projects For the first quarter of 2020  we expect revenues from our Completion   Production Solutions segment to decline 10  to 15  sequentially with decremental EBITDA margins in the upper 20  to lower 30  range  Our Rig Technologies segment generated  759 million in revenue in the fourth quarter  an increase of  110 million  A sharp increase in land rig equipment sales  including sales of older inventory at low margins and improved progress on offshore projects drove the 17  sequential improvement in revenue  However  an unfavorable shift in product mix together with old inventory  we ve moved at a discount were only partially offset by cost savings  which limited incremental margins and resulted in a  7 million increase in EBITDA to  112 million or 14 8  of sales Orders declined  10 million or 5  to  211 million in the fourth quarter and the total segment backlog at year end was  2 99 billion  Sharp improvement in land revenues resulted from a significant increase in year end equipment deliveries and better progress on land rig projects During the fourth quarter  we booked orders for six land rigs destined for multiple customers in the Middle East with three of the rig orders specifying our NOVOS control system  We are seeing NOCs more frequently pushing their contractors to provide high spec land drilling rigs that can meaningfully improve performance and operator returns  The growing number of international operators pursuing development of tight gas formations is accelerating the demand for this equipment And similar to what we re seeing in our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit  the equipment these customers are seeking is beginning to look like the high spec equipment found in West Texas  We ve seen this in Argentina for several years and are now seeing customers across the Middle East and Asia pursue 1 500 horsepower rig packages with three gensets that are almost identical to what we re selling into the US During the fourth quarter  we also realized a substantial increase in revenues from deliveries of offshore capital equipment and from improved progress on our offshore wind construction vessel projects  We continue to see gradual improvement in offshore markets  with steady demand for rig equipment and technology upgrades as well as a growing opportunity set for our marine construction business  including replacement cranes for FPSOs  equipment for pipelay vessels and additional offshore wind construction vessels NOV continues to leverage our core competencies to assist in the development of solutions that help our customers reduce their environmental footprint  while also improving operational efficiencies  In the fourth quarter  we introduced our PowerBlade Hybrid system that is currently being installed on a rig in the Norwegian Continental Shelf  PowerBlade allows drilling contractors to reduce their carbon footprint and fuel costs by recycling the captured energy back into the rig  We estimate that the PowerBlade system will allow the drilling contractor to reduce diesel consumptions by 771 000 gallons per year  saving them  1 75 million in cash  reducing 110 tons of NOx emissions per year and reducing their carbon footprint or CO2 emissions by 6 200 tons per year Revenues from our rig aftermarket operations were flat sequentially  due to a decrease in spare part sales that resulted from budget exhaustion that sit in with our customers near the end of the year  Additionally  the significant increase in the number of rigs enrolled in our total cost of ownership programs moderates the Q4 uplift we ve historically seen in our service and repair operations  We ve increased the number of offshore rigs in our programs to 83 at year end and an increase of over 2 4 times since the end of 2018 In the first quarter of 2020  we expect lower deliveries of capital equipment to be partially offset by a slight increase in aftermarket sales  resulting in a 10  to 15  sequential decrease in revenues and a 100 basis point to 300 basis point reduction in EBITDA margins  While we know there is much more work to be done in 2020  We were pleased with the strong finish to 2019 and the progress the organization made on key initiatives throughout the year  Actions taken by the talented hard working employees of NOV allowed us to balance our efforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies with advancing our technologies and supporting our customers with cost effective solutions  Those actions have NOV well positioned for the future With that  we ll now open the call to questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Company  Your line is now open Byron Pope    Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co    AnalystGood morning  guys Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerHi Byron Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi Byron Byron Pope    Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co    AnalystClay recognizing the extra uncertainty injected into the market by the recent pullback in Brent prices  could you just frame for us at a high level  how you think about the international growth drivers among the three business segments again just at a high level Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  We re    big picture  North America  we expect to I think like everyone else to enter a slowdown    continued slowdown in activity and we re preparing for that  But we re more    much more encouraged overseas and in offshore markets in particular  So that continues to move higher and what we re hearing from our customers is that they re moving forward with a lot of projects that they ve been working on reducing costs and engineering and over the last several years and so excited about that for 2020 And then the Middle East has continued to remain very active and as you re well aware  we ve increased our presence in those markets and are encouraged by the needs that our customers have there for equipment and technologies that NOV provides  So generally  North America drifting down in offshore and international moving up  Current oil price volatility notwithstanding  Byron Byron Pope    Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co    AnalystThanks  And then my second question  just again in qualitative terms  could you    as you think back on the five incremental NOV growth drivers    growth opportunities that you guys laid out back at the 2018 Analyst Day  just from your perspective  how things are progressing  Again notwithstanding the near term North America headwinds  but just how those have played out relative to your expectations Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerWell  the main thing I m most proud of is our continued investment in technologies and products through the downturn and we certainly highlighted that in our Analyst Day  which was well over a year ago and in a very different sort of commodity price environment  but I look back on the progress we ve made really since the downturn started  I think you know we ve probably introduced more new products and new technologies than any of our peers out there  We launched our NOVOS  sort of test rig at the very end of 2014 and that s been responsible for dozens of products and technologies  We ve come out with very impactful digital solutions through this time period  Predictive analytics for BOPs  for example  are NOVOS operating system  our GoConnect digital products  things like that and so I think we ve balanced the cost cutting in the retrenchment that has been necessary with continuing to invest in the long term future of the company and the technologies that are going to make that happen  And so  I m very proud of our organization in terms of progress on these things and I think a lot of ways through the downturn we ve been focused on addition to efficiencies and getting better working capital management  I m really laying the foundation for what the next up cycle looks like Byron Pope    Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co    AnalystThanks  Clay  Appreciate it Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet  Thank you  Byron OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc  Your line is now open Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc    AnalystGood morning and thanks for taking my questions Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Tommy Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc    AnalystSo I wanted to touch on the portfolio review that you ve been undertaking for some time now  It s clear  it s a returns driven analysis that you re running through  And so my question is  as you re evaluating  what to keep and what to prune  How many years forward are you willing to look for a business line or a unit to hit the kind of returns that you d like to see to keep it in the portfolio  And the reason I m asking is  clearly  offshore and international have some momentum  but we need to play that forward for some reasonable time horizon to get comfortable to where you re willing to underwrite  So anything you could do to help us frame that up would be helpful Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  that s a great question  I m going to let Blake chime in here in a minute  because he s heading up this effort  But  I would say  it depends on the potential to achieve what we always aim at in the application of capital  which is a defensible business that has a demonstrable competitive advantage over the long haul is the ultimate goal  And so when we look at these different businesses and kind of the current state of affairs and the current state of their markets and so forth we take a view necessarily on what s the likelihood and probability that we ll get to that state  that defensible competitive advantage in a reasonable period of time  And so I would say  our patience level is somewhat dependent upon the potential payoff and attractiveness of that particular business opportunity  but it s really kind of opportunity by opportunity that we evaluate this Blake McCarthy    Vice President  Corporate Development   Investor RelationsYes Tommy  I think we touched on this last quarter but this is not just a quantitative exercise but also qualitative  And so we just take a step back and say like  oh  if this business is below the return threshold but it s been bouncing along the bottom of the down cycle and we could see a clear tangible path to the orders have completely pivoted on this one and done a full 180  We re not going to sell at the bottom of its earnings potential Now I will say  we have quite touched upon our patience level for a lot of these that did all below the threshold  we were able to implement some discrete action plans that are in process right now that we will reevaluate  And most of these action plans only take about three to nine months  So it s just more self help  which is part of our job is managing these businesses  And those that we find are to be unfixable  those will be evaluated for divestiture or just pure exit Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes that s our first inclination is around    we re paying to fix these things and run these things  And so are there steps we can take first  So that s probably where our default is for businesses that fall below the threshold initially Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc    AnalystVery helpful  Thank you both  And as a follow up  I wanted to double back on the international and offshore outlook  Again  looks like we ll be up for 2020 versus the prior year just in terms of the addressable market there  Are there any particular aspects where you think NOV could maybe outperform the broader market business lines or parts of the world where you re most excited that you would call out for us Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Probably what we re    we re certainly well known for drilling equipment offshore rigs  all things with drilling  What s probably less well known by investors on Wall Street is the fact that we ve sort of quietly assembled a really interesting portfolio of products that are more focused on production going into FPSOs  fixed platforms  processes around production in terms of sand separation  oil water separation  monoethylene glycol regeneration units things like that  And so I m really  really proud of that portfolio  And I think there s really interesting opportunities that are going to continue to emerge in the offshore where NOV is likely to play maybe a little larger role than we would have in a prior upturn Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc    AnalystThank you  That s all for me  And I ll turn it back Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America  Your line is now open Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrilll Lynch    AnalystHey  good morning  So I guess  Clay you talked a bit about kind of energy transition  And so I m just kind of curious  if you can kind of flush it out a little bit more here and kind to talk about your strategy toward energy transition and maybe organically what you re doing  And then also maybe on the M A side Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  First I d say that we have a presence in this space going back many years and in fact many decades with respect to geothermal for instance where you probably be hard pressed to find a geothermal well that doesn t have NOV technology involved with it anywhere in the globe  And then secondly  I think last year we had a couple of announcements around offshore wind installation vessels  which is a space that NOV has a very    has a market leading position in terms of the technologies and vessels install offshore wind turbines  And so we ve been in renewables for going back a long time My comments in the prepared remarks though really are just to let you know that we re thinking about other ways to participate in this and viewing it as potentially a terrific business opportunity  When I think about energy  energy really is all about infrastructure  about capital deployment  historically pivoting from one form of energy to another is sort of a decade long process  but involves enormous amounts of capital  it involves project execution  it involves application of technology  it involves creative ideas  NOV has a lot of those in abundance  And so I do think there s a role here that we can play and in helping make that happen But what I want to stress is we re aiming at capital returns coming out of that at the opportunity to develop technologies and services and methods that help in that transition  but also earn excellent returns for our shareholders  And so that s how I m framing this  I don t have a lot more to add to that other than what I said earlier some ideas in the space that we think are unique that potentially can turn into a really interesting and profitable businesses  and    but we    I generally don t    won t get into the details until we re earning    making revenue with these things Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrilll Lynch    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks Clay  I guess  if we kind of come to the supply chain a little bit and think about the coronavirus  You mentioned it a little bit there s  obviously  a direct impact and maybe some direct    indirect impact as we think about the supply chain being so interconnected  Is there a certain segment that we should look at and try to understand better about the impact from what s going on over in China  And then help us understand how much of that is actually in your guide on their Blake Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Chase  It s Jose  I ll fill this and Clay can chime in  But no it is a situation that is evolving rapidly and it s something that we re monitoring very closely  So I think our base exposure to this is more from a supply chain standpoint than it is from a customer revenue opportunity set  But as we did talk about in some of the prepared remarks  China is an emerging and growing market for our end products  in which we re having more and more success with our differentiated technology offerings We do have a very global and diversified supply chain  But as we sit here today and we re looking at an extended shutdown of the China New Year holiday system that is impacting our ability to produce certain products to a certain degree  At this point  we still have a lot of latitude to make up lost ground  But if this were to extend much longer  there are areas for instance within our Fiber Glass business where we have limitations in terms of the amount of resin that s on the ground at our manufacturing plants right now  So there s some risk there but so far so good  Similar type of exposure related to drill pipe manufacturing  other businesses to a lesser extent  but so far  we think our team is managing through it pretty effectively  But still a lot of uncertainty related to the extent to which this will impact operations Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And those are sort of first order impacts  I m equally concerned about second quarter impacts  which is the impact that this has on global demand for oil  what it s done in the commodity price markets  And go to the point kind of what it does to the psychology of oil and gas producers as they think about  how much to drill in 2020  So  it s    as we said  the situation remains very fluid Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrilll Lynch    AnalystYes  Understood  All right  I will turn back over  Thanks Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Chase OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup  Your line is now open Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystYes  Good morning Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Scott Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Scott Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystTurning to C P  how should we think about the C P margin profile over the course of 2020 I m just thinking about the interplay between the mix shift in the revenue stream toward more international and offshore  but also the cost out program  I know  you don t want to provide too many specifics beyond one quarter out  but just any general color on how that margin profile should progress given that interplay Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Scott  it s Jose  I ll start off on this one  So  we re not going to really deviate from the typical way we describe in terms of thinking about margin progression for the cap segment  which is really think of it in terms of incremental margins  basically dollar dropping between  0 25 to  0 35 down to the EBITDA line  And obviously that is dependent on the mix of the business and really what you re getting at is with the decline that we re seeing in demand for equipment in the North American market  and the solid growth that we re seeing overseas  particularly for offshore markets Typically  some of those offshore projects in the early phases of recovery have been slightly more challenged from a margin perspective  But as Clay alluded to  and I think we touched on a couple of times during our prepared remarks  with the amount of tendering activity  we think we re starting to now see more opportunities for pricing improvements  But here  as we stand today  you also need to think about the latency time associated with some of these offshore projects  where they sort of reside in our backlog  a bit longer than the shorter cycle North American centric product offering  So what s going through converting to revenue right now is to a large degree stuff that was booked 9  12 months ago  And so as we start capturing better pricing  we should see the incremental margin profile improve along with being further supported by the cost cutting initiative efforts that we have under way Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystGot you  But overall  for the year do you think that we should be thinking about that are lighter than normal margins  Or given some of the pricing trends you end up doing closer to the normal incremental for the year Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerI think on a blended basis  it s more    there s a lot of puts and takes here Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerA lot of parts and pieces  So I would assume fairly normal Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  And then maybe  if you could just give us a quick update on the rental initiative that you guys really push forward a couple of years ago  particularly on the drilling tools side of the business but even more broadly just an update on the rental model initiative particularly as the international markets pick up further in 2020 Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerScott  you re talking about our drilling tools business  the rental    we have a couple of rental business around  I think you re talking about the investment we ve made in directional drilling technologies  rotary steerables and SelectShift  And we d tell you that we re continuing to gain traction in that  We ve got three different rotary steerable tools in the marketplace including what we think is the lowest cost  a very highly differentiated rotary steerable tool Our SelectShift motor that we introduced last year  which is the adjustable bent housing motor that could be adjusted downhole  A very large operator in the US is testing that this week  We ve had a lot of excitement around that  MWD tools also that we have in the space  So we re continuing to make progress in here  but that strategy was built on the recognition that unconventional drilling    unconventional shales really rely on geosteering on horizontal drilling and it is a kind of enabling and key technology for unconventional technologies    or unconventional shales that NOV has an opportunity here to be a larger provider of technology into that space Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd maybe one thing I d just add just so there s no confusion about it  So  as Clay mentioned  there s a number of areas where we do provide rentals of equipment  The space that we re talking about is a combination of both rentals and sales  but just want to make it clear  that we re somewhat agnostic on that  But what we do want to make clear is that this is not a service that we are providing  We are enabling those directional drilling service companies out there Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystGot it  Appreciate the color Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  good morning everybody Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Kurt Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  Clay  thanks for that historical perspective resonates with me  that s for sure  So in the context of what you guys see going forward  And Clay  yes  NOV s always been at the forefront of evolving on the technology front and creating some value propositions that ultimately oil companies and service companies find useful  You threw out that teaser about some things that you re working on in the hopper  Can you maybe elaborate a little bit  maybe give us a little bit more of a teaser as to what kind of value propositions you may be looking at for the next leg of growth for NOV Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerOn renewables  I m going to demur on that  On the    are you talking about renewals  or you re talking about traditional oilfield  Kurt Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystWell  I ll go wherever you want to take it  Clay  So if you want to demur on renewables  that s fine Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerWell  as a matter of fact  we like    we much prefer to talk about things that are in the marketplace that are starting to get traction  And so in terms of what I m most excited about really  the predictive analytics products that we introduced a few years ago continue to gain traction  I think Jose referenced the growing number of rigs in our programs  We re monitoring equipment and able to predict in advance operational challenges before those happen NOVOS operating system for drilling rigs both land and offshore is gaining a lot of traction and really beginning to contribute meaningfully  Our wired drill pipe IntelliServ data transmission  Downhole data transmission technology combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence is improving results for operators  In fact there s a great article in this month s Journal of Petroleum Technology about what we ve done for US driller in space  And so I again  just to reiterate could not be more proud of sort of the enhancements that we have going on  And those are actually just a few of many  many things that NOV has introduced through the downturn Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  And then just a follow up in the context  I appreciate that color by the way  In the context of the capital allocation you indicated that if all goes well you could be potentially in a position to kind of restart a share repo program  Just kind of curious as to the decision framework between the say the share repo versus maybe bumping the dividend a bit  Any insights would be appreciated on that front Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you  Yes with respect to where our stock has been trading  we think there s good value in that and have gone through that in a great detail with our board  We ll continue to look at it by the way  But we re    I think the way we view that right now is that share repurchase is preferred  but the key thing is that our capital priorities remain unchanged in all of our    you look back to 2019 all of our actions were really geared toward continuing to improve  We implement a lot of cost savings that are driving better EBITDA  We refinanced and paid down a lot of our debt  And so we re continuing to work toward being in    achieving the credit metrics that we talked about that will pave the way for a greater level of capital return to shareholders Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Appreciate that OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan  Your line is now open Sean Meakim    JP Morgan    AnalystThank you  Good morning Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Sean Sean Meakim    JP Morgan    AnalystMaybe I ll try to ask the prior question just with the different angle  So in terms of the free cash guide for 2020 and uses of that cash  So we noted buybacks could be coming earlier this year  obviously dividends well covered  capex may be a bit elevated this year but that s discrete  very specific  You ve also in effect supplemented some of your capex spend with technology  bolt ons over time has been a big part of the strategy this cycle in particular  is something like  200 million a good run rate for bolt ons  Just I m trying to capture other uses of cash that could come before the buybacks in  20 Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  That s a great point  Sean  We re always looking at opportunities in the M A space  And I think we ve been pretty transparent about that  And so what I d say is in 2019 and this sort of fits with my prepared comments around the fact that oilfield assets and equities have gotten a lot cheaper in the current environment  And so we re always looking at kind of what s the next best application of NOV s shareholders  capital and to the    and that M A outlook changes from time to time as we kind of work through the year Blake McCarthy    Vice President  Corporate Development   Investor RelationsYes  Sean  this is Blake here  I d just like to add that we both Clay and our board gives us the flexibility like we don t have a run rate on like a target for acquisitions for a year  Every acquisition is an individual investment decision that we raised that we also compare relative to the investment in our own stock  So at this point like I think there s a lot of opportunities out there  It s a very crowded field of sellers right now and a very limited set of buyers  So we think that there could be some attractive valuations out there but we re going to be very  very patient Sean Meakim    JP Morgan    AnalystGot it  Thank you for that  That s helpful feedback  And then    so well done to see all the efforts on working capital start to come through and convert the cash and that s been a top priority especially for Jose  So with the 4Q results and your expectation that working capital will be a source of cash again in  20  just curious to get any updated thoughts on seasonality as we go through the year in terms of working capital  And then just how you re targeting working capital efficiency by the end of 2020 or  21  maybe any updated thoughts around working capital to sales or DSOs inventory turns DPOs etc Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I don t think we ll get super granular in terms of specifying the targets  But what I would like to spend just a moment talking about is that what we are seeing is a lot of good progress and a lot of good momentum by a lot of hard working people across the organization  We ve been at it a while but obviously the results really started to come through in the second half of 2019  And we have a lot more work to do  but with the momentum that we have and opportunities that we ve identified  we re confident and our ability to harvest more cash from our working capital and just become a lot more capital efficient as we progress through 2020 So we finished 2019 with that working capital to revenue run rate just a tiny bit over 30   which was a good outcome for us  Now what we re really going to be focused on during 2020  and you asked the question related to seasonality  It s really going to be more focused on the average level of working capital intensity really throughout the life of the organization  So a lot of progress through the course of the year  but if you look at the average for 2019  average the starting balance sheet and ending balance sheet apply the total annual revenue to it that was 37   So we re trending in the right direction  But we certainly want that average to come way down during the course of 2020 and that would put us at a Q4 run rate that will be better than where we finish this year Sean Meakim    JP Morgan    AnalystFair enough  That s really helpful  Thank you Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet Blake McCarthy    Vice President  Corporate Development   Investor RelationsThanks  Sean OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Vebs Vaishnav with Scotiabank  Your line is now open Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Vebs Vebs Vaishnav    Scotiabank    AnalystHey  good morning and a very good quarter  I guess just a clarification  You guys talked about  230 million of cost savings is    I guess I just want to confirm that that s comparable to the  200 million number earlier that you had guys guided to Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Yes  we found another  30 million in annualized  Both those numbers are annualized cost savings as compared to our structure in the first quarter of 2019 Vebs Vaishnav    Scotiabank    AnalystGot it  Okay  C P orders  you talked about it could be somewhat lower in 1Q  Can you just talk about what kind of visibility do you have beyond that and that s both for C P orders and Rig Tech orders  Can we sustain what we saw by in the first Q  Can we sustain what we saw in 2019 Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Q4 was I think our fifth quarter in a row of book to bill north of 1 for completion and production solutions  A lot of these orders particularly for offshore projects  we have a lot of lead time into because there s a lot of work that goes into them  sometimes there s Feed studies behind them things like that  And so a lot of the near term  the downturn that we expect in Q1 in orders in Completion   Production Solutions  it s really just the timing of how those things fall And    but that  notwithstanding  what I m most encouraged about is the fact that our tendering activity across the portions of Completion   Production solutions that are focused on the offshore remains very strong  I think we mentioned that our PFT Group  for instance  the pipeline there is twice what it was a year ago  And so it feels to us like the offshore infrastructure is continuing to move forward and that s a really good backdrop I think to move into 2020 with respect to orders for Completion   Production Solutions Vebs Vaishnav    Scotiabank    AnalystGreat  And maybe just one last question for me  And on the guidance for Wellbore  So  it sounds    it seems like yes you guys did like only down revenues 4  versus guidance of 5  to 7   so like not very different from the guidance  You talked about North America only declined 11   So  never spectacular in 4Q  I was a little surprised by the guidance of down 6  to 12  for 1Q  I think like you talked about China and could have an impact  Could you just elaborate like what is guiding that and how should we think about North America versus international in the guidance Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  part of the overachievement in Q4 was a higher drill pipe sales than we had expected going into the quarter  Part of our expectation for Q1 is that turns around  That s a little lumpier than some of the other businesses within Wellbore Technologies Jose Bayardo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd I d also add you look at the guidance across the Board related to the sequential decline from Q4 to Q1  we do look back the last couple of years in terms of the fall off that we ve had from Q4 to Q1  Feels like that the E P budgeting process both within North America and the international markets is getting a little bit more prolonged and gets    certainly gets amplified when you add in a pullback in commodity prices and the fears related to the coronavirus  So  that is certainly factored in to an extent into the Q1 guidance Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYes  one more thing  We like a lot of business for instance has seasonality exposure in Russia and the Rockies and places like that  So  it s just    our expectation is that that will all contribute to Wellbore Technologies moving down in Q1 Vebs Vaishnav    Scotiabank    AnalystGot it  That s very helpful  Thank you for taking my call Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet  Thank you OperatorThank you  That concludes our question and answer session  I would now like to turn the call back over to Clay Williams for any further remarks Clay C  Williams    President  Chairman  and Chief Executive OfficerI want to thank everyone

161415,382931,NOV,Goldman Sees These U S  Stocks Faring Better If Inflation Rises,news," Bloomberg     If the Federal Reserve is indeed able to boost inflation  stocks with high pricing power should benefit  according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  
Fed officials have talked about the potential for adopting an average inflation targeting approach  If they did so and tried to let price pressures mount  the odds of near term rate hikes will probably decrease  That s assuming it even works  as economists and central bankers have been overestimating inflation potential for years 
Such an outcome would be favorable to U S  equities because of the more dovish rate scenario  but likely less favorable for their earnings  Goldman strategists led by Ben Snider wrote in a note Friday 
 With input cost pressures high and likely to keep rising  companies will need to be more aggressive in raising prices or accept lower profit margins   the strategists said   Stocks with low labor costs should also outperform as inflation expectations rise  
Snap on Inc   Weatherford International Plc and National Oilwell Varco Inc  NYSE NOV   are among stocks with high pricing power that could fare well amid the Fed pivot  Goldman s report said  Stocks that could fare worse include Alaska Air Group Inc   ICU Medical Inc  and GoDaddy Inc   the firm said 
 Since at least 1985  high pricing power stocks have typically outperformed when the market perceived an imminent decline in corporate profit margins   the strategists wrote   In addition to companies with the pricing power to pass through rising input costs  firms insulated from those cost pressures should also outperform  ",2019-03-18,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-sees-these-us-stocks-faring-better-if-inflation-rises-1810178,1810178

161448,382964,NOV,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Halliburton Company  National Oilwell Varco  Superior Energy Services And RPC,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 4  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    National Oilwell Varco  Inc    NYSE NOV    Superior Energy Services  Inc    OTC SPNV   and RPC Inc     NYSE RES   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Oil Price Plunge Puts Jobs Across Oilfield Industry in CrisisThe oilfield services industry has witnessed a massive downturn over the last few quarters  With WTI Crude price still struggling to cross the  50 per barrel mark for a sustained period  oilfield services companies are experiencing slowdown in recovery  This lean period forced oilfield service providers to cut costs significantly by suspending some of their major operations and trimming jobs while looking for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas  While this strategic action might improve profit levels to a certain degree  the overall sentiment surrounding the industry persists to be mostly negative Industry PerformanceLet s take a look at the price performance of the oil and gas field services industry  In the past five years  the S P 500 Index has surged 51 7  against the oil and gas energy sector s 33 1  slump  During this period  the Zacks oil and gas field services industry plunged a whopping 46 4   Moreover  the industry currently ranks at the bottom 5  of the Zacks Industry Rank Oilfield Jobs in JeopardyWhile behemoths like Halliburton are grappling with issues  smaller companies are faring no better In a bid to bounce back from the controlled spending by oil and gas producers due to weak prices  Halliburton Company plans to slash headcount by nearly 800 at its El Reno operation in Oklahoma  Further  it plans to close its office in the suburbs of the same city Also  the move comes within two months of Halliburton s announcement of laying off 650 employees across four states  namely New Mexico  Wyoming  North Dakota and Colorado This Houston based oilfield service provider realized that in order to enhance its operating efficiency despite challenging market conditions  it has to lower costs substantially Halliburton noted that for operators in North America where oil production hit record levels  it s more about returns now and not growth  The volatility in commodity price convinced explorers and producers to adopt a relatively conservative approach to capital expenditure programs  This shift in customer strategy is likely to induce subdued demand for oilfield services and equipment  putting much pressure on pricing This organizational restructuring is anticipated to help Halliburton achieve its purpose of minimizing expenses and optimizing operational excellence by testing and supporting its employees Further  Texas based National Oilwell Varco  Inc  announced that it will retrench 85 personnel as it plans to shut down its equipment making operations for offshore and onshore drilling rigs at its Galena Park facility due to the continuing drop in shale business  which  in turn  induced a fall in drilling and completion activity in the United States and Canada Additionally  in the recently reported quarter  National Oilwell Varco s bottom line declined from the year ago period s break even earnings as North American drillers scale back their production growth plans  leaving less scope of work for the likes of National Oilwell Varco Moreover  Pumpco Energy Services  Inc   an affiliate of Superior Energy Services  Inc   widely known for delivering fracking services for well digging completions  recently made 112 workers redundant at its Odessa  TX based site  While RPC Inc   confirmed reducing part of its workforce  The company has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here ConclusionEven though the oil and gas field services industry spreads bearish sentiments among investors  sluggish US oil output might give a wake up call to ramp up activity on the international front for narrowing the demand supply divide  This  in turn  could create an avenue of opportunities for multinational oilfield service companies 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current

161451,382967,NOV,National Oilwell Varco  NOV  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas industry supplier is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 16 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  433 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 10 billion  down 12 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 18  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for National Oilwell Varco 
For National Oilwell Varco  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 87  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that National Oilwell Varco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that National Oilwell Varco would post earnings of  0 10 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 61  delivering a surprise of  710  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
National Oilwell Varco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/national-oilwell-varco-nov-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200503307,200503307

161476,382992,NOV,Key Factors To Impact Williams Companies   WMB  Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Williams Companies  Inc    NYSE WMB   is expected to release third quarter 2019 results after the closing bell on Wednesday  Oct 30  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is a profit of 24 on revenues of  2 1 billion 
Let s delve into the factors that might have influenced the company s performance in the September quarter 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Williams   Atlantic Gulf  and  Northeast G P  segments   which collectively represents more than 70  of the company s adjusted EBITDA   are likely to have performed well in third quarter 2019  The Atlantic Gulf unit showed year over year improvement of  103 million or 22 6  in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter  while the company s Northeast G P business grew by  64 million or 25    
Thanks to the expansion projects around Transco  the country s largest gas transmission system and Williams  core project  being placed into service in over the past two years and the additional volumes from these takeaway infrastructures on the back of record drilling activity  the company is likely to have experienced continued strength third quarter in revenues 
In particular  the completion of the Atlantic Sunrise project   the biggest expansion project in the history of Transco   is likely to have contributed to substantial incremental fee based revenue and driven EBITDA growth  Our model estimates third quarter adjusted EBITDA for the unit to be  540 million  12 5  above the year ago revenue of  480 million 
On the other hand  the Northeast G P unit is expected to reflect the impact of higher volumes triggered by rising natural gas production from Marcellus and Utica shales  As a proof of this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter Northeast G P adjusted EBITDA is pegged at  338 million  higher than  281 million reported in the year ago quarter
However  Williams  extensive natural gas exposure raises its sensitivity to the commodity s price  In particular  lower gas prices in the third quarter is likely to have had an adverse impact on the volumes and distribution growth potential at Williams Partners  the company s largest income generating business segment 
What Does Our Model Say 
The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Williams is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the chances of beating estimates  But that s not the case here 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

161548,383064,NOV,Look to energy names for global demand clues,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Slumping energy shares drove the recent U S  stock market selloff more than any other major group  so investors are turning to next week s slate of earnings to see if the sector can pull itself out of the pit 
The third quarter earnings picture for energy looks grim  Profit growth expectations for S P 500 energy companies have fallen more than any other sector   from a forecast of 13 8 percent on July 1 to the current 1 8 percent  Thomson Reuters data showed 
Energy shares dropped 9 2 percent in the third quarter  and the sector is on track for a decline of 3 6 percent for 2014  the weakest performance of any S P 500 sector 
The decline has followed a sharp drop in oil prices  dragged down by weakening global demand and a rising dollar  With various names due to report next week  including Exxon Mobil  N XOM   Chevron  N CVX   ConocoPhillips  N COP  and National Oilwell Varco  N NOV   there are hopes that executives will suggest that the fall in oil and share prices has overstated the outlook for these names 
 It isn t just about these particular companies  What they have to say is an important factor for the entire global demand story   said Quincy Krosby  market strategist at Prudential Financial  based in Newark  New Jersey 
 All the market has been looking for is less bad news  
The energy sector over the last 20 weeks has spiraled from being the market leader to now ranking as its most distant laggard  according to a Relative Rotation Graph study  which analyzes the relative performance of the constituents of an index 
The S P energy sector up about 6 percent from Oct  15  while the S P 500 is up 5 5 percent from its Oct  15 low and the benchmark index on Friday posted its best weekly gain since early January 2013 
Some analysts expect demand from North American energy and construction industries to boost performance for some in the sector going forward  even with peaks in activity in North Dakota and other areas 
And with profit estimates down for energy  its price to earnings multiple is among the lowest for S P 500 sectors  at 14 3 times estimates earnings  Thomson Reuters data showed 
 Sure these oil companies may have some price pressure    but longer term  many of them are going to be just fine   said Robert Lutts  chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management in Salem  Massachusetts 
Still  estimates for the fourth quarter and 2015 so far show an even bigger decline in energy s profit outlook 
S P 500 energy earnings now are expected to decline 4 3 percent in the fourth quarter  which is down from a July 1 forecast for 10 4 percent growth  Thomson Reuters data showed 

For 2015  profit growth for the sector is estimated at just 1 8 percent  the weakest of any sector  That compares with a forecast of 11 1 percent growth for the entire S P 500  Thomson Reuters data showed

161588,383104,NOV,Earnings Preview  National Oilwell Varco  NOV  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 29  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas industry supplier is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  216 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 08 billion  down 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 554 54  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for National Oilwell Varco 
For National Oilwell Varco  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  25 71  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that National Oilwell Varco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that National Oilwell Varco would post a loss of  0 09 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 20  delivering a surprise of  122 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

161610,383126,NOV,Will National Oilwell Varco  NOV  Report Negative Earnings Next Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"The market expects National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas industry supplier is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  50  
Revenues are expected to be  1 95 billion  up 8 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 504 96  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for National Oilwell Varco 
For National Oilwell Varco  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  14 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that National Oilwell Varco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that National Oilwell Varco would post earnings of  0 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 03  delivering a surprise of  62 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line

    Factors at PlayThe oil crash toward the end of 2018 caught the energy companies off guard  especially the oilfield services players  Weaker demand for oilfield equipment due to low prices persisted in the first quarter of 2019 as well  While oil prices witnessed a rebound of more than 30  in the first quarter  capital discipline undertaken by various energy explorers is likely to affect the performance of oilfield equipment providers like National Oilwell  A week ago  the company s Chairman Clay Williams  NYSE WMB   warned investors that the firm will likely come up with lower than expected results from each of its three segments amid tough operating environment  Notably  adjusted EBITDA from the Wellbore Technologies segment is projected at  129 million  suggesting a decline from the last reported quarter s  155 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA from Rig Technologies and Completion   Production units is pegged at  66 million and  76 million  implying a decrease from the last reported quarter s  102 million and  112 million  respectively Contraction of orders  fewer deliveries of drill pipes and other equipment  and slowdown of activities in both the offshore and North American markets are likely to impact the company s first quarter results  Notably  National Oilwell anticipates first quarter 2019 sales to come in at  1 94 billion  indicating a sequential fall of 26  The expected figure is a tad lower than the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimate Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that National Oilwell will beat estimates in the to be reported quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat the consensus estimate  That is not the case here as you will see below  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  14 07   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of loss of 10 cents a share is pegged a penny above than the Zacks Consensus Estimate Zacks Rank  National Oilwell currently has a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be sure of a positive surprise Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for National Oilwell  here are a few energy firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model  These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarterly release Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   has an Earnings ESP of  4 43  and a Zacks Rank  1  The firm is expected to release quarterly earnings on Apr 26  You can see  ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   has an Earnings ESP of  1 55  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is anticipated to release first quarter earnings on Apr 30 Encana Corporation   NYSE ECA   has an Earnings ESP of  44 83  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is anticipated to release quarterly earnings on Apr 30 Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you can more effectively safeguard your retirement with a new Special Report   4 Warning Signs Your Investment Advisor Might Be Sabotaging Your Financial Future  ",2019-04-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-in-store-for-national-oilwells-nov-q1-earnings-200409054,200409054

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is National Oilwell Varco due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  National Oilwell Varco Posts Wider Q1 LossNational Oilwell Varco reported loss of 20 cents per share in first quarter 2019  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents loss and the year ago loss of 18 cents  Weaker than expected contribution from the all segments led to this underperformance Seasonal demand slowdown in international markets and pricing pressure in North America meant that adjusted EBITDA from the energy equipment maker s Wellbore Technologies unit totaled  117 million  below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  129 million Further  adjusted EBITDA from the Completion   Production Solutions segment came in at  28 million  far from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  76 million  The miss was on account deferred equipment deliveries National Oilwell Varco s Rig Technologies segment s adjusted EBITDA of  56 million also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  66 million due to weakness in offshore projects  fewer capital equipment supplies and seasonally lower service and repair work   Total revenues of  1 9 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 billion but rose 8 1  from the year ago period Segmental PerformanceRig Technologies  Revenues came in at  603 million compared with  483 million in the year ago quarter  reflecting an increase of 24 8   The unit s adjusted EBITDA was  56 million  24 4  higher than  45 million recorded in the year ago quarter  driven by strong aftermarket revenues Wellbore Technologies  The segment s revenues rose 13 5  year over year to  807 million  The unit s adjusted EBITDA of  117 million also improved from last year s  103 million  aided by rebounding commodity prices and activities  together with strong drill pipe sales Completion   Production Solutions  Revenues at the segment were  581 million  down 13 3  from  670 million in the year ago quarter  The unit recorded adjusted EBITDA of  28 million  significantly lower than the year ago figure of  73 million  While certain projects were pulled forward to the previous quarter  segment results were also impacted by tepid order intake and postponement of deliveries by clients led to the downside BacklogCapital equipment order backlog for Rig Technologies was  3 1 billion as of Mar 31  2019  including  1271million worth of new orders Meanwhile  the Completion   Production Solutions segment s backlog for capital equipment orders totaled  1 billion at the end of the first quarter  The figure included  470 million of new orders Balance SheetAs of Mar 31  2019  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  1 3 billion and long term debt of  2 5 billion  The debt to capitalization ratio was 15 2  What Lies AheadNational Oilwell management said that the quarter s underwhelming performance could be attributed to the twin factors of the tightness in the upstream companies  investment budget due to low year end crude prices and decline in offshore sales following a bumper fourth quarter that saw accelerated deliveries  Worse  the quantum of new capital equipment order continues to remain weak  However  the company sees improved customer confidence and order acceleration for the remainder of 2019 on oil price rebound In response to the changing market dynamics  National Oilwell Varco is looking to continue its disciplined approach to capital spending and improve efficiency

January following the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  That put WTI down 22  from its Apr 23 high of  66 30  officially meeting the definition of a bear market The report showed that crude stockpiles recorded another unexpected weekly build  ballooning to their highest since July 2017 as domestic output hit 12 4 million barrels a day for the very first time  On a further bearish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   both increased sharply from their previous week levels Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks  which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR   an assortment of the largest U S  energy companies   down more than 1  Wednesday  Consequently  some of  the biggest

ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   and Diamondback Energy   NASDAQ FANG   Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 6 8 million barrels for the week ending May 31 to a nearly 2 year high  The analysts had expected crude stocks to go down some 1 7 million barrels  Record high domestic production and sharp rise in imports led to the year s second biggest stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer In particular  output in the United States rose by 100 000 barrels per day last week to 12 4 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  Meanwhile  imports jumped 1 1 million barrels Oil inventories have generally trended higher since mid March  In fact  stockpiles have expanded in 8 of the last 11 weeks and are up nearly 44 million barrels  or 10   during the period The latest report also shows that stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma rose to their highest since December 2017  Inventories at the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up 1 8 million barrels to 50 8 million barrels At 483 3 million barrels

the supply cover was 25 8 days Gasoline  Gasoline supplies tallied a third successive weekly gain as imports and production rose  The 3 2 million barrels addition   dwarfing the polled number of 208 000 barrels build   took gasoline stockpiles up to 234 1 million barrels  Taking into account last week s increase  the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2  above the five year average range though it remains 2  below the year earlier level Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  surged 4 6 million barrels last week  while analysts were looking for an inventory draw of around 1 08 million barrels  The massive increase could be attributed to lower demand even as refiners continued to churn out distillates at a brisk rate  Current supplies   at 129 4 million barrels   are 10 8  higher than the year ago level though stocks remain 3  below than the five year average Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 0 6  from the

161649,383165,NOV,Stocks Take A Break After Four Day Rally ,opinion,"After halving the correction losses in just a few weeks  we knew the market would have to take a break and pull back a bit  On Tuesday  the major indices started this shortened week with declines well over 1  each  putting an end to a four day winning streak 
	The NASDAQ took the biggest tumble with a decline of 1 91  to 7020 36  while the S P was off 1 42  to 2632 9  The Dow slipped 1 22   or 301 points  to 24 404 48  The indices did come off their lows late in the session 
	Stocks have been on a roll since the sharp Christmas Eve pullback  In fact  in the month since that selloff  the major indices have put together four straight weeks of gains  They ll have to get back on track pretty quickly now to stretch it to five weeks since the market was closed on Monday for MLK Day 
	The session came under pressure right from the start on renewed fears of slowing global growth  especially from China  The world s second largest economy grew by 6 6  last year according to new data  which was actually its slowest pace in nearly 30 years 
	And then we received news reports that the U S  had cancelled a trade meeting with China officials  leading to another leg lower for stocks  However  the White House refuted the report and said there were no official meetings scheduled  which may have been the main reason why stocks came off their lows in the final hour 
	After four weeks in the green  no one is too concerned about Tuesday s pullback  But it shows just how much we want a real resolution on the trade front  Sentiment has been high of late and the market is expecting some sort of deal in the coming weeks  so less than flattering headlines like today s are going to sting a bit  Perhaps a solid earnings season can keep investor spirits high while Washington figures out the trade impasse and the government shutdown Today s Portfolio Highlights Home Run Investor  Concerns about this earnings season are overblown  according to Brian Bolan  The editor wants to get the portfolio back up to 15 names as soon as possible  so he added today and will do the same again tomorrow  On Tuesday he picked up Kratos Defense  KTOS   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  defense play  of course  that is mostly known for its focus on drones  The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for four straight quarters and can t wait for this government shutdown to end  Read the full write up for more on this new pick and be ready for another buy on Wednesday Surprise Trader  This afternoon s pullback opened a great opportunity to make a move  so Dave quickly decided to add Alaska Air  ALK  with a 12 5  allocation  This airline topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for four straight quarters and heads into this Thursday s after the bell report with a positive Earnings ESP of 2 23   The editor also appreciates that ALK is part of a space in the top 4  of the Zacks Industry Rank  Read the full write up for more  Stocks Under  10  Las Vegas stocks have been doing well lately  so Brian Bolan is getting back into Everi Holdings  EVRI   This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  provider of gaming payment solutions and slot machines was in the portfolio a couple times last year because it was at an attractive entry point  And there s nothing different this time  Brian thinks it s a deal at under  7 25  The stock has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three straight quarters and the editor believes it will do so again when it reports in a few weeks  See the full commentary for more this addition and be ready for another buy tomorrow TAZR Trader  The SPX has already rallied more than Kevin originally thought it deserved  so it s likely stuck in between 2400 and 2800 for the near future  Therefore  the editor plans to take any nice sized gains that he can get  On Tuesday  he sold Square  NYSE SQ  for a 30 8  return in a month and Twitter  TWTR  for a 17 9  profit in less than a month

161650,383166,NOV,National Oilwell Varco  NOV  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas industry supplier is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  300  
Revenues are expected to be  2 19 billion  up 11 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 20 96  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for National Oilwell Varco 
For National Oilwell Varco  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  10 46  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that National Oilwell Varco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that National Oilwell Varco would post earnings of  0 12 per share when it actually produced break even earnings  delivering a surprise of  100  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
National Oilwell Varco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/national-oilwell-varco-nov-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200381228,200381228
161651,383167,NOV,National Oilwell  NOV  To Post Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,National Oilwell Varco  Inc    NYSE NOV   is scheduled to release fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 6  after the closing bell Houston  TX based National Oilwell is a world leader in designing  manufacturing  and selling of comprehensive systems  components  products as well as equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production worldwide In the last reported quarter  the company reported weaker than expected results amid lesser than expected contribution from Wellbore Technologies  and Completion   Production Solutions segments  Coming to earnings surprise history  National Oilwell has managed to beat estimates in just one out of the trailing four quarters  delivering average negative surprise of 87 5  National Oilwell Varco  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see which way are top and bottom line estimates headed this time The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings stands at 8 cents  having declined by a penny over the past 30 days  Nonetheless  it reflects a turnaround from the year ago loss of 4 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  2 191 million compared with  1 969 million in the prior year quarter Let s take a look at the factors that are likely to shape National Oilwell s fourth quarter earnings Factors at PlayDuring fourth quarter 2018  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude plunged from a multi year high of  76 40 a barrel in early October to below  45 in late December  per the U S  Energy Information Administration  The overall decline in the commodity price will likely be unfavorable for Core Laboratories  as oilfield equipment service providers  performance are positively correlated with crude price The declining oil prices have certainly weighed on the backlog of the company  The backlog of National Oilwell s Completion and Production unit is estimated at  805 million vis a vis  1 070 million in the prior year quarter  This reflects a sequential fall of 8 5   As it is  operating profit from Completion   Production Solutions failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter due to tepid pressure pumping demand  The trend is likely to continue amid weak oil prices and high labor costs Weaker contribution from offshore activities further aggravates our concerns amid the low crude environment  Notably  the backlog for the offshore focused Rig Technologies segment  created early last year  is pegged at  3 316 million  representing a sequential decline  New orders are estimated at  197 million versus  256 million in the last reported quarter While higher demand of superior technologies from the Wellbore unit may provide some relief  we expect National Oilwell to post

What s Next for National Oilwell Varco 
While National Oilwell Varco has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

161653,383169,NOV,National Oilwell  NOV  Q4 Earnings Lag  Sales Top Estimates,opinion,National Oilwell Varco  Inc    NYSE NOV   reported earnings of 3 cents in fourth quarter 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents per share  Weaker than expected contribution from Wellbore Technologies unit led to this underperformance  Operating profit from the energy equipment maker s Wellbore Technologies unit totaled  41 million  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  46 36 million However  National Oilwell s bottom line witnessed a turnaround from the year ago loss of 4 cents on the back of improved results across all the segments Total revenues of  2 398 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 191 million  The top line also rose 21 8  from the year ago period National Oilwell Varco  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segmental PerformanceRig Technologies  Revenues came in at  804 million compared with  614 million in the year ago quarter  reflecting an increase of 31   Solid execution of projects and higher aftermarket sales led to the improved performance  Consequently  the unit s adjusted EBITDA came in at  102 million  45 7  higher than  70 million recorded in the year ago quarter  Wellbore Technologies  The segment s revenues rose 23 6  year over year to  884 million  Strong demand owing to greater market adoption of the unit s superior technology services  domestically as well as internationally  drove the top line  The unit s adjusted EBITDA of  155 million also increased from the year ago figure of  107 million  aided by higher volumes and improved product mix    Completion   Production Solutions  Revenues at the segment were  788 million  up 14 2  from  690 million in the year ago quarter  Robust capital equipment demand for land production and steady progress with its projects drove the upside  As such  the unit recorded adjusted EBITDA of  112 million  up 51 4  from the year ago figure of  74 million BacklogCapital equipment order backlog was  3 1 billion as of Dec 31  2018  including  119 million worth of new orders Meanwhile  the Completion   Production Solutions segment s backlog for capital equipment orders totaled  894 million at the end of the fourth quarter  The figure included  470 million of new orders Balance SheetAs of Dec 31  2018  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  1 4 billion  and long term debt of  2 7 billion  The debt to capitalization ratio was 16 3  Uncertain Prospects Ahead With crude prices being on an upward trajectory for most part of 2018  full year revenues of National Oilwell totaled  8 45 billion  representing more than 25  increase from 2017  However  after touching multi year highs of  76 40 a barrel in early October  prices slided below  45 in late December amid oversupply concerns and weakening demand  The prices are still hovering around  50  55 a barrel amid worries about economic slowdown and trade tussles  As such  amid the growing crisis  many exploration and production companies have slashed their capital spending for 2019  which is likely to affect the performance of oilfield equipment providers like National Oilwell  The sharp decline in the oil prices in the last months of 2018 led to a contraction in orders  which is likely to impact the near term prospects of National Oilwell  In fact  the company itself foresees a sequential fall in revenues from all the three segments While things have gradually started looking up for international and offshore markets  the recovery is still not around the corner  While National Oilwell s impressive portfolio of products and services is much appreciated  a tough operating environment and weakness in commodity prices are likely to hamper the Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

161654,383170,NOV,Good Feelings For Good Dealings,opinion,"Deals are sprouting up all over the place  More specifically  it s the hope for deals  Nevertheless  the major indices each soared by more than 1  on Tuesday after what s being called a  tentative  agreement in Congress that would avert another government shutdown 
	The Dow  understandably  gained the most with a jump of nearly 1 5   or about 372 points  to 25 425 76  The NASDAQ was right behind with an advance of 1 46   or around 106 points  to 7414 62  The S P rose 1 29  to 2744 73  closing above its 200 day moving average for the first time since early December right before that month moved us into a correction 
	President Trump has already let us know that he s not exactly happy about the agreement between the aisles  which puts less money toward a border wall than desired  However  he didn t say he would oppose it 
	The market doesn t really care what s in the deal  it just wants to keep the government from shutting down again only a few weeks after the longest shutdown in history  The market wasn t hurt the last time the government closed its doors  but no one knows how long that would last if it happened again 
	And since we re feeling better about this issue  why not take an optimistic tone toward trade as well  The next round of negotiations between the U S  and China kicked off today  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are expected to participate later in the week  President Trump has reluctantly said the early March deadline could be extended if necessary 
	Now we just need these good feelings to result in signatures on real deals  Today s Portfolio Highlights Counterstrike  In its last quarterly release  CyberArk Software  CYBR  reported strong results  but it didn t help the stock at all  Nevertheless  Jeremy had faith in this provider of IT security solutions  so he added it in late November and has since watched it jump double digits  However  it s time for CYBR to report again later this week  and the editor feels that the downside risk is now greater than the upside reward  Therefore  he sold the stock on Tuesday for a 25 3  return in less than 3 months 
	On the other hand  Plantronics  PLT  has already reported earnings  which included an impressive earnings beat of 119  and a guide higher  This global leader in audio communications looks to be in the midst of a long term turnaround  as evidenced by earnings estimates rising enough to make the stock a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   PLT has recovered after getting cut in half last year  and Jeremy thinks it can grind into the high  50s  though his shorter term target is just under  50  The editor added PLT today with an 8  allocation  Read the full write up for all the specifics on this new buy  including a look at its chart Surprise Trader  Today s addition was GasLog  GLOG   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that owns and manages liquefied natural gas carriers  The stock has a robust Earnings ESP of 17 7  for the quarter coming in less than 48 hours  before the bell on Thursday   Dave is also feeling pretty good about a beat because of the divergence between the rising earnings estimates and slumping stock price  He put the portfolio s remaining cash into GLOG  Read the full write up for more Large Cap Trader  Shares of Ubiquiti Networks  UBNT  had a nice run after a strong earnings report  However  this telecom company is not participating in today s sharp rally higher  John decided this was a great time to sell UBNT and take a gain of 24 6  in just a little over a month   There is nothing wrong with a nice profit that shows up early   said the editor  He also sold TE Connectivity  NYSE TEL  for a 1 2  return  The plan is to hold off on replacing these stocks until we get a negative session Stocks Under  10  Shares of Internap Corporation  INAP  are having a good year so far  rising north of  5 50 from around  4 in just a few weeks  Brian Bolan thinks this data center IT services play has bottomed out and could be poised for more improvement from here  The editor thinks INAP could be a stock that the portfolio holds for a long time  Read the complete commentary for more on this new buy

NYSE HD    Macy s   NYSE M   and Lowe s   NYSE LOW   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Shares in ANGI HomeServices made significant gains early on Thursday after an impressive quarterly earnings report  though they sold off later with the broader markets Shares in ANGI are still up a whopping 75  in 2018 versus a gain 5  in the S P 500 Net earnings came in at  0 09 share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  and total revenues were  303M  2  higher than the consensus and 67  higher than the year ago period ANGI HomeServices is a subsidiary of Interactive Corp  and includes the popular sites Angie s List  HomeAdvisor and the recently acquired Handy which match consumers with qualified contractors  technicians and service professionals  They also operate eight other sites serving the US  Canada and Europe and have attracted over 15 million customers over the past 20 years Parent company IAC owns and operates approximately 150 brands   mostly in the internet space   and has been aggressively adding promising companies to its expanding portfolio  Most notably  IAC also operates the Match Group  NASDAQ MTCH  which specializes in dating apps   including the wildly popular Tinder Service At their core  home services and dating services are actually quite similar  using technology to introduce two parties who may not have had any opportunity to meet for a mutually beneficial relationship and also using experience in internet marketing to attract new users to their sites IAC and Match have successfully fought off a planned expansion into the dating space from social media giant Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and they remain the most popular suite of dating apps on the market  IAC is applying that same market and media savvy approach to the HomeServices division Thanks to an aggressive strategy of acquisitions  ANGI is expected to more than double its revenues in 2018 to  1 15B and increase them further to  1 4B in 2019  The company is able to take advantage of significant economies of scale   using the same basic infrastructure as the backbone of the operation  while tailoring the individual user experience at its many sites to appeal to as wide an audience as possible Even going into the latest report  recent upward earnings revisions earn ANGI a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and that trends looks likely to continue as the company continues to build market share in the  400B billion home services market in the US as well as abroad  Prices for US crude oil have recently declined more than 20  from their 4 year highs reached last month  officially entering bear market territory  A combination of increasing US domestic production  rising stockpiles and a lower than expected impact from sanctions on Iran have all contributed to a sharp drop in prices over the last five weeks Lower oil prices are often positive for the economy as a whole and for the pocketbooks of consumers who can expect to pay less for gasoline at the pump  but they tend to be bad for the companies who supply oil producers Shares in National Oilwell Varco have also been punished over the same period  also shedding 20  of their value since the beginning of October  Though the company does not drill for oil or market petroleum products itself  it supplies a wide range of technology  equipment and services to the oil industry for exploration  extraction and production The US is now producing more than 11 5 million barrels day and is forecast to top 12M day by early in 2019  Saudi Arabia and Russia have also stepped up production lately in anticipation of a sanction related falloff in output from Iran  The US granted eight major exceptions allowing other countries   most notably India   to continue purchasing from Iran and the result is a global supply glut During periods of depressed prices  oil producers are less likely to make the investments in capital that will allow them to increase volumes in the future  A major component of models for the expected return on future projects is a forecast for the price of oil   and lower sales prices make initiating those projects look less advantageous The most recent quarterly report at NOV was a significant disappointment with the company turning in a breakeven net profit  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 12 share NOV noted that they saw lower than expected performance in

Should You Buy Home Depot Stock Ahead of Next Week s Earnings Home Depot helps kick off the retail heavy portion of Q3 earnings season next Tuesday  ahead of reports from Macy s and other giants later in the week The question is should investors consider buying Home Depot stock ahead of earnings  Let s see what to expect and look at some of its current fundamentals to find out Price Movement  We can see in the chart below that Home Depot stock has crushed the S P 500 over the last five years  Home Depot stock has climbed over 50  in the last three years  with much of that expansion coming in the last 24 months  With that said  the last year has not been as kind to the home improvement retail powerhouse Shares of HD are up roughly 14  in the last 12 months  but have slipped around 1  since the start of 2018  Plus  Home Depot stock is down nearly 6  during the past three months  Home Depot stock closed at  187 23 per share on Wednesday  down 13  from its 52 week high of  215 43 per share  which sets up what could prove to be a solid buying opportunity ValuationMoving on  HD is currently trading at 18 6X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a significant discount compared to its industry s 25 7X  Home Depot is trading slightly above its rival Lowe s at 17 3X and the S P 500 s 16 8X But HD has traded as high as 23 7X over the last year  with a one year median of 20X  The company is also trading not too far above its 52 week low of 17X  We can also see that Home Depot is trading below its five year median of 19 9X  Therefore  HD s valuation is picture hardly appears stretched at the moment Overview   OutlookNow that we have covered Home Depot s current valuation picture and its stock price movement  it s time to take a quick look at its business and understand what we should expect from the company s third quarter financial results Home Depot is the world s largest home improvement retailer and boasts 2 286 locations  The firm did  100 9 billion in sales last year  up 6 7  from fiscal 2016 Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Home Depot s third quarter revenues to jump by 4 9  to reach  26 25 billion  Meanwhile  HD s full year revenues are projected to surge 7 3  to touch  108 23 billion At the other end of the income statement  Home Depot s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop 23 4  to land at  2 27 per share  Better yet  the home improvement giant s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to climb over 28  It is also worth noting that Home Depot s comparable store sales are expected to climb 4 7  based on our current NFM estimates total comps jumped 5 3  last quarter  Furthermore  Home Depot s overall customer transactions are projected to climb by roughly 4   with its average ticket expected to pop from  62 84 to  64 74 Bottom LineInvestors should note that Home Depot s earnings estimate revision activity has trended downward over the last 30 days to help HD earn a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Yet  HD sports an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and its stock rests below where it has traded recently  Plus  Home Depot almost always tops our quarterly earnings estimates  with beats for over five straight years  It is also worth remembering that Home Depot is a solid income stock  This helps it look more attractive  especially during market uncertainty  Better yet  Home Depot has significantly increased its quarterly dividend over the last few years  HD paid a cash dividend of  1 03 per share in the second quarter  which marked a nearly 50  jump from 2016 s  0 69 per share and a 16  climb from 2017 s  0 89 Home Depot is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results before the opening bell on Tuesday  November 13  And it looks like Home Depot stock might be worth considering Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums

	The Dow provides the best example of today s craziness  The index jumped by more than 350 points early in the session and then plunged to a more than 200 point loss at its worst  It recovered enough to finish lower by only 0 22   or about 53 points  to 24 370 24 
	Meanwhile  the S P took a similar trajectory  but never threatened to break below 2600 again as it momentarily did yesterday  The decline was a slight 0 04  on Tuesday to 2636 78 
	The NASDAQ again outperformed its counterparts and was the only major index to finish in the green by advancing 0 16  to 7031 83  On Monday  these indices moved sharply lower right off the open  but staged an epic recovery with a lot of help from tech  The space did not have as strong a performance today  though it didn t selloff either 
	Much of the market s swings can be traced to the trade war s indecisiveness  President Trump tweets about  very productive conversations   while China is considering cutting tariffs on cars made in the U S  At the same time  the U S  plans to condemn China over hacking and espionage  while the Huawei CFO story remains in the headlines 
	On top of everything  the President and Democratic leaders have an argument on immigration and a possible government shutdown right in front of the press  which is actually one of the least surprising things to happen today when you consider the times we live in  However  it was another reminder of just how cantankerous things will be in Washington when the Dems assume control of the House next month

161694,383210,NOV,National Oilwell  NOV  Reconstitutes Reporting Segments,opinion,"National Oilwell Varco  Inc    NYSE NOV   recently restructured its business segments by combining two of its offshore levered segments into a single unit  The company combined Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets into a single unit named Rig Technologies during fourth quarter 2017  The strategic move is likely to enable National Oilwell to reduce the administration burden and better align the company with the evolving market conditions 
While Rig Systems was engaged in the design and manufacturing of integrated drilling systems and components for land and offshore drilling rigs  Rig Aftermarket was involved in the delivery of consumables  spares and other necessary services to maintain the usefulness of the assets  Notably  both these segments witnessed weaker year over year income in the last quarter amid lower activities and order cancellations 
The company which is expected to release fourth quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 5  forecasts its offshore dependent unit Rig Technologies to deliver better than expected results in the quarter  However  management remains concerned about its Completion and Production Solutions arm whose results are expected to be below the prior guidance 
Deferred deliveries of a new product in its Subsea Flexible Pipe business along with engineering challenges and scarcity of orders in its Process and Flow Technologies unit is likely to hurt the results of the segment  Meanwhile  National Oilwell expects results from its onshore focused Wellbore Technologies to be in line with expectations 
Further  the company also anticipates to incur  120  140 million pre tax restructuring charges  This would include expenses for facility closures  severance and inventory write downs  as well as other charges in the quarter under review

161696,383212,NOV,Can Improved Price Favor National Oilwell  NOV  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"National Oilwell Varco  Inc    NYSE NOV   is set to release first quarter 2018 results after the closing bell on Apr 26 
Houston  TX based National Oilwell is a world leader in the designing  manufacturing and selling of comprehensive systems  components  products and equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production worldwide 
Last quarter  the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents  In the trailing four quarters  the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 6 9   without missing any estimates  This can be attributed to cost reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies  This quarter  the company is expected to report a loss of 4 cents as well National Oilwell Varco  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors at Play
Prices of oil at the end of January to March quarter of 2018 were  62 73 per barrel  up about 8 4  sequentially and 27 2  from the year ago period  amid improving demand outlook and OPEC production cut deal  The energy equipment supplier is likely to realize the benefit of recovering commodity price environment 
In the last reported quarter  the company reconstituted its offshore focused business segments by combining Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets into a single unit named Rig Technologies  to reduce administrative burden of the company  aligning it better with evolving market conditions 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Completion   Production Solutions segment s first quarter operating profit is pegged at  26 55 million  up from  8 million in the year ago period and  19 million in the last reported quarter  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wellbore Technologies  first quarter operating profit is  18 88 million  up from operating loss of  21 million and  57 million sequentially and year over year  respectively 
However  the company recently warned investors that the company s first quarter 2018 revenues are  primarily due to declined progress in new offshore rig construction as well as client associated equipment deferrals  The company expects its revenues to come in at  1 8 billion in the first quarter  reflecting 3 4  year over year decline  It is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 889 billion 
Also  sequential shipments of subsea production equipment declined during the end of the first quarter  which can hurt the company s top line  Moreover  National Oilwell s adjusted EBITDA is now anticipated to reach about  160 million  down from  197 million sequentially 
What Does Our Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that National Oilwell is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP represent the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  National Oilwell has an ESP of  22 73  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 5 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 4 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  National Oilwell carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank of  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Energy Stocks with Favorable Combinations
Here are some companies from the energy space which  according to our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Frisco  TX based Comstock Resources  Inc    NYSE CRK   has a Zacks Rank  2 with an Earnings ESP of  37 34   The company will report earnings on May 14 
Houston  TX based Oil States International  Inc    NYSE OIS   has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  32 83   The company will report earnings on Apr 25

5 Energy Stocks Ready to Beat Earnings This QuarterOver the last three years  the energy market has experienced intense price volatility  However  it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness  energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery  With crude now back over  50 and natural gas revolving around the pivot point of  3  the panic that swept over the market are all but gone  The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the penultimate quarter of 2017 Let s take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the third quarter of this year and what makes the Energy sector a material factor this earnings season Q3 Report Card  Prices End on a Positive NoteOil  The U S  oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply demand narrative The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  Moreover  energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year  Also  supply from the 14 member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months  helping to tighten the market significantly  Adding to the positive momentum  OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market  oil ended the third quarter at  51 67 per barrel  up about 10 5  sequentially  A year ago  crude futures hovered around the  45 per barrel mark Natural Gas  Natural gas fared badly  dropping about 3 5  in the July September period  thanks to the fuel s tepid demand on the back of mild weather conditions and hurricane related power outages Despite the sequential fall  natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016  The commodity futures ended the quarter at  3 per MMBtu  up more than 3  from the Sep 30  2016 settlement of  2 9 per MMBtu Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices  All oil gas related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products Year over Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil Energy sector were spectacular  driving the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index  The April June period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 252 7  jump from the same period last year   the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way   on 16 8  higher revenues The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q3 earnings season as well  This is not surprising  considering that oil and gas both improved from the year ago period  In fact  the strongest growth in Q3 is again set to come from the Energy sector  As per our  report  earnings for the sector are expected to be up 122 4  from the third quarter of 2016  while the top line is likely to show an impressive growth of 17 9  How to Identify the Outperformers The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our third quarter earnings estimates Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors  This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat But with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better than expected earnings While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  our proprietary methodology      makes it relatively simple  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re

161717,383233,NOV,Can Higher Oil Drive Whiting Petroleum s  WLL  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corporation   NYSE WLL   is slated to release third quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Wednesday  Oct 25 
In the trailing four quarters  the Denver  CO based company had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7 14  
In the preceding quarter  Whiting Petroleum beat the consensus mark by 5 3  on robust output and cost control Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
 

    
The question lingering in investors  minds now is whether Whiting Petroleum will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Oil Price Improvement  The U S  oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply demand narrative 
The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  Moreover  energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year  Also  supply from the 14 member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months  helping to tighten the market significantly  Adding to the positive momentum  OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done 
With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market  oil ended the third quarter at  51 67 per barrel  up about 10 5  sequentially  A year ago  crude futures hovered around the  45 per barrel mark 
Whiting Petroleum stands to benefit from recovering commodity prices as it will be able to extract more value for their products 
Asset Sale  In August  the Bakken focused upstream operator inked a  500 million deal to divest its Fort Berthold assets in North Dakota to a private explorer RimRock Oil   Gas Williston  LLC  While the  will help Whiting Petroleum to reduce debt and streamline its portfolio  it is also likely to lower its third quarter production 
What to Expect 
Management had earlier guided third quarter total production in the band of 10 5 11 1 million barrels of oil equivalent  MMBOE   We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is 10 8 MMBOE  at the midpoint of the company s forecast range but below the 11 MMBOE reported in the year ago quarter  In particular  we anticipate oil production at 7 4 million barrels  MMBbl   down from the prior year quarter volume of 7 8 MMBbl 
Meanwhile  analysts polled by Zacks expect average realized oil price to rise 7 2  from the year ago quarter to  39 20 per barrel  while average natural gas price realization will be up 6 7  to  1 91 per thousand cubic feet   
What Does Our Model Say 
Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 34  
Zacks Rank  Whiting Petroleum is  2 Ranked  Though a Zacks Rank of 2 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum  here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter

161719,383235,NOV,Refining Unit To Buoy Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   is scheduled to report its third quarter earnings on Thursday  Oct 26  before market opens 
In the preceding three month period  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0 96  on lower gross margins and elevated costs  In particular  operating income from the Refining   Marketing segment   which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings   fell to  562 million compared with  1 025 million in the year ago quarter 
As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Findlay  OH based downstream operator has a mixed history  It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
 

 
   However  things do look bright for the company in the quarter under review  In fact  the positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter  which moved up 7 4  over the last 7 days 
Moreover  shares of Marathon Petroleum have done better than the peer group so far this year  The stock has been up 14 2   as against the  industry s gain of just 2 5  

Let s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Marathon Petroleum s third quarter results 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
We expect improving refining outlook to buoy the company s bottom line in the third quarter of 2017  With margin estimates going up and throughput set to be higher  Marathon Petroleum s refining and marketing unit is expected to report solid quarterly results 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at  419 million  36 9  higher than the reported figure in the third quarter of 2016 
Meanwhile  we expect profitability for the midstream  or pipeline transportation  segment to be  420 million  up from  258 million in the third quarter of 2016  Earnings will be likely driven by solid process and fractionation volumes  along with contribution from investments in new projects 
Amid the encouraging scenario  the impact from Hurricane Harvey is expected to play a minor role in the quarter  We expect a fairly negligible effect on throughput operations on the combined Galveston Bay Texas City facilities  while cost increase is also likely to have a small negative effect on Marathon Petroleum s quarterly results 
Overall  the significant uptick in the refining business will likely offset any negative impact 
What Does Our Model Say 
Our proven model too shows that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat earnings in the to be reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP   for this company stands at  0 14   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Marathon Petroleum carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us confident of an earnings beat 
Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  On the other hand  the Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
Which Other Energy Companies Have Positive Surprise in Store 
Marathon Petroleum is not the only energy firms looking up this earnings season  Here are some companies from the space which  according to our model  also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
Denbury Resources Inc    NYSE DNR   has an Earnings ESP of  100  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is likely to release earnings on Nov 7  You can see  
Suncor Energy Inc    NYSE SU   has an Earnings ESP of  8 07  and a Zacks Rank  2  The partnership is anticipated to release earnings on Oct 25 
National Oilwell Varco Inc    NYSE NOV   has an Earnings ESP of  10 91  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release earnings results on Oct 26 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

161720,383236,NOV,Should You Sell National Oilwell Varco  NOV  Before Earnings ,opinion,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and National Oilwell Varco  Inc    NYSE NOV   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because National Oilwell Varco is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NOV in this report 
In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss seven cents per share for NOV  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of eight cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NOV  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  13 04  heading into earnings season 
National Oilwell Varco  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that NOV has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for National Oilwell Varco  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum   from stocks under  10 to ETF to option movers   from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ",2017-10-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-sell-national-oilwell-varco-nov-before-earnings-200220937,200220937

161743,383259,NOV,Energy Sector To See Strongest Growth In Q3  5 Top Stocks,opinion,We are now at the beginning of the Q3 earnings reporting cycle  Only 5 2  of the total S P 500 companies have reported their numbers so far  while none of the energy companies have reported their quarterly earnings yet It should be noted that crude supply glut concerns have eased during the past July to September quarter  and this improvement is reflected in the  report that shows the energy sector as the prime contributor to the index s year over year earnings growth Meanwhile  we have used our proprietary  tool to pick a few energy stocks that are poised to post strong Q3 numbers Energy to Lead S P 500 in Q3Here at Zacks  we divide the S P 500 index into 16 major sectors  and the energy sector will likely contribute the most in Q3  We expect the sector to witness 123 1  year over year earnings growth on 17 8  gain in revenues Eight of the 16 sectors will likely see year over year declines in third quarter earnings while the rest  excluding conglomerates and the energy sector  are projected to report single digit earnings growth  Only the energy sector is predicted to register triple digit earnings growth  Excluding the energy sector  the S P 500 index is anticipated to decline 0 7     Record Crude Price Backs EnergyAs per   The West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude saw a 12 2  gain in the third quarter of 2017 after two consecutive quarters of decline this year  Notably  this is the highest quarterly gain since the April to June quarter of 2016 Also  according to The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   the average monthly price for the first two months of third quarter 2017 was higher than the year ago comparable period  Lower global crude inventory primarily supported the crude price rally in the third quarter Oversupply Concerns Ease in Q3Per the EIA  during the July to September quarter of this year  worldwide oil inventories decreased by 500 000 barrels per day  B D   With this  the inventory level fell for three quarters in a row According to The Oil   Gas Journal  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  produced an average of 32 9 million B D in the third quarter as compared to last November s 33 4 million B D Thus  it can be safely concluded that the leading crude exporter s landmark production cut deal primarily supported the draws in global crude inventory Bet on Oil Energy StocksCrude prices determine the fate of energy players  With the massive third quarter crude improvement  upstream energy players are expected to report strong Q3 numbers  Companies involved in exploration and production activities will likely gain  while contract drilling players and drilling equipment makers are

The DoJ put the pressure on Deutsche Bank   NYSE DB   a few weeks ago when it proposed a multi billion dollar fine  Shortly after  several hedge funds had begun to ask for other banks to help smooth out the counter party risk while others were rumored to have severed tied with Deutsche altogether  Then Deutsche began to lose some wealth management clients as a result of the fallout  And today  the zee Germans came out and said they have ruled out any state aid for Deutsche Bank  Telling legislators it was inconceivable  I don t believe Deutsche is in any real insolvency trouble  They will be just fine in the long run  But the shareholders better watch out

161806,383322,NOV,NOV  A Lesson On Dividend Safety,opinion,"National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  surprised many dividend investors with its decision to slash its dividend by 90  on April 11  Income investors could have avoided the cut by paying closer attention to the company s main risk factors 
The dividend cut announcement came shortly after the company s CEO gave an investor presentation on March 22 
In the slide deck  the company was noted to have a  strong balance sheet  and  resilient free cash flow generation   perhaps giving dividend investors a false sense of security 
While business trends weren t great  sales fell by 52  last quarter   the company still had over  5 billion in cash and undrawn credit capacity compared to  3 9 billion of debt and just  710 million in dividend payments made last year 
National Oilwell Varco s free cash flow payout ratio over the last twelve months was also still somewhat reasonable at 81  
Simply put  most companies that end up cutting their dividends are usually in far worse shape by the time they opt for a reduction 
How could conservative income investors have known to avoid buying National Oilwell Varco for its dividends 
At Simply Safe Dividends  we do our best to help dividend investors avoid companies that cut their dividends before the dividend is actually reduced 
Analyzing the main factors that support a company s ability to pay a dividend allows us to assess the dividend s safety and find safer dividend stocks 
We review a company s debt levels  payout ratios  recession performance  cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  profitability trends  and more to generate Dividend Safety Scores 
Scores range from 0 to 100 with scores of 50 being average  25 or lower considered weak  and 75 or higher considered excellent 
Using this process  Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   BHP Billiton  LON BLT   and other major dividend payers were each flagged as being in the riskiest 10 20  of stocks out there for dividend safety well before they ultimately cut their dividends 
Let s take a closer look at National Oilwell Varco  which scored in the bottom 10  for dividend safety prior to announcing its dividend cut 
One of the first safety factors we consider is the industry that the company is in  A company s industry has a large influence on the stability of the cash flows a business generates 
For example  an industry selling construction equipment will experience a high level of cyclicality  whereas beverage companies enjoy steadier demand 
National Oilwell Varco operates in the oil field machinery industry and essentially supports oil wells across their entire lifecycle   from the time they are drilled through their production and maintenance 
When oil prices are high  oil producers have incentive to drill more wells and increase their production  driving demand higher for National Oilwell Varco s products and services 
However  the opposite is also true   low oil prices cause producers to pull back on their investments  hurting demand for oil field machinery 
Commodity prices are inherently unpredictable  Surprises happen  and companies that depend on commodity prices are not always prepared 
As a result  cyclical industries that rely on commodities receive lower marks for dividend safety  Furthermore  we pay especially close attention to near term trends for these sensitive businesses 
Since commodity prices are unpredictable  a small cut can quickly turn into a gaping wound  If business trends begin to deteriorate  a company s Dividend Safety Score will quickly start to drop 
The chart below shows National Oilwell Varco s quarterly sales growth  We can see that growth turned negative in the first quarter of 2015 and quickly plummeted from there  The company s Dividend Safety Score began to fall quickly after the second quarter of 2015  and business trends only worsened from there Source  Simply Safe Dividends
On a somewhat related note  our Dividend Safety Scores take into consideration how a company performed during the last recession 
Companies with the safest dividend payments typically sell essential products and services that can power through periods of economic weakness  Many of these businesses held sales stable during the financial crisis 
As seen below  National Oilwell Varco s diluted earnings per share fell by nearly 30  in fiscal year 2009  While its performance was better than many other energy companies  this is clearly a business that is sensitive to the broader economy  NOV s stock also plunged by nearly 70  in 2008 
Energy is not one of the best stock sectors for dividend income Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Besides a company s industry  near term business trends  and recession performance  its balance sheet is incredibly important 
Businesses will always meet their debt obligations before they pay dividends  If times get tough and cash flows dry up  unprepared companies with too much debt can be forced to make very difficult decisions 
National Oilwell Varco s balance sheet was actually in decent shape at the time of its dividend cut  The company had just over  2 billion in cash on hand compared to  3 9 billion of debt and  710 million in dividend payments made last year Source  Simply Safe Dividends
However  the company s dependence on commodity markets once again compromised the safety of its dividend 
With fears that low oil prices could keep demand lower for longer  National Oilwell Varco made a reasonable decision to do whatever it takes to preserve cash flow and keep its balance sheet healthy 
Cutting the dividend by 90  will improve the company s cash flow by over  600 million per year  Until there are clearer signs that the industry has bottomed  National Oilwell Varco will remain conservative 
Our Dividend Safety Score had also noted that the company had only been paying dividends since 2009  While National Oilwell Varco had increased its dividend for over five straight years  management had shown less of a commitment to the dividend than many other companies  such as those in the dividend aristocrats list 
While oil companies such as ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  have taken on more debt and sold off assets to keep their dividend growth streaks alive  this was presumably less of a concern for National Oilwell Varco 
Finally  we pay attention to trends in a company s dividend payout ratio  A rising payout ratio means that a company s dividend has increased relative to its earnings 
This can happen because of strong dividend growth  falling earnings  or some combination of the two 
If earnings are falling fast  a payout ratio that looked safe last quarter can quickly become dangerous 
In the case of National Oilwell Varco and other stocks  we like to evaluate long term trends in payout ratios  As seen below  the company s free cash flow payout ratio increased from 14  in 2013 to 81  in 2015  Its payout ratio also doubled from 2014 to 2015 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While a payout ratio of 81  is not ideal  it could also be much worse  However  investors need to remain aware that payout ratios can quickly deteriorate 
Given the cyclical nature of National Oilwell Varco s business  our Dividend Safety Scores flagged the company s rising payout ratio and reduced its safety score accordingly 
If business trends continued declining in 2016  anything can happen in one year in commodity markets   there s not much stopping the payout ratio from doubling again to an unsustainable level Closing RemarksDividend investors can improve the safety profile of their portfolio s income by doing their homework  Simply monitoring a company s payout ratio is not enough to evaluate the safety of its dividend 
Our Dividend Safety Scores to size up all of the key risk factors impacting a company s ability to continue paying dividends  and we use our scores to avoid risky income stocks 
Checking a stock s Dividend Safety Score prior to making an investment decision can help income investors can steer clear of many risky income stocks such as National Oilwell Varco 
By sticking with companies that score well for Dividend Safety  we sleep better at night with the holdings in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks and Conservative Retirees dividend portfolios 
While the market s direction can always surprise us  we expect our portfolios  dividends to continue being paid in almost any environment and continue growing over the long run ",2016-04-21,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nov:-a-lesson-on-dividend-safety-200125918,200125918

	Chicago  IL   June 8  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Devon Energy Corp  NYSE DVN       Schlumberger Ltd      National Oilwell Varco Inc  NYSE NOV       Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG      and Hercules Offshore Inc      

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup

	It was a week where oil prices fell from their multi month highs but natural gas rocketed to levels not seen since early January 

	On the news front  Devon Energy Corp     announced a non core asset sale of  1 billion  while Schlumberger Ltd      acquired an automation technology company 

	Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell 1 4  to close at  48 62 per barrel  natural gas prices jumped 10 5  to  2 398 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Oil snapped its three week winning streak after a Baker Hughes report showed rise in the U S  oil rig count for the first time in almost 3 months    indicating a resurgence in shale drilling activities  Things were further hampered by a dismal May jobs data  underlining weak oil demand  The commodity was already under pressure from the uneventful OPEC summit that again failed to agree on a production freeze 

	On the other hand  natural gas surged big time following a bullish inventory report and predictions of strong cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature across the country over the next few days 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  Independent energy producer Devon Energy Corp  has entered into agreements with undisclosed parties to sell upstream properties worth almost  1 billion 

	The Oklahoma City based oil and natural gas producer will offload non core assets in East Texas for  525 million and Anadarko Basin s Granite Wash area for  310 million  Additionally  Devon Energy will sell an overriding royalty interest in Northern Midland Basin for  139 million  Proceeds from the transactions   which are scheduled to close in the third quarter   will be used to further fortify the company s investment grade financial position 

	Devon Energy and other companies have been hit hard by the two year long oil price collapse forcing them to slash jobs  defer cancel projects worth billions of dollars and renegotiate contracts with suppliers to help protect their balance sheets  In February  Devon Energy slashed its dividend by 75  and cut 2016 capital investment by similar proportions 

	2  Oilfield services behemoth Schlumberger Ltd  announced the purchase of Omron Oilfield and Marine  Inc   in order to strengthen its control system capabilities for integrated well construction 

	Houston  TX based Omron Oilfield and Marine  Inc  is a subsidiary of Japanese company Omron Corp  The company designs  manufactures  sells as well as offers aftermarket services for automated drive and control systems  power houses  and drillers  cabins  The company also provides software based drilling technologies on a rental or subscription basis 

	Schlumberger is set to benefit substantially from the transaction  The buyout should help the company enhance its expertise and global reach  The deal is also expected to open up new market opportunities for Schlumberger 

	3  Energy equipment maker National Oilwell Varco Inc     has agreed to buy the completion tools operations of Trican Well Service  For the acquisition  National Oilwell will pay almost C 53 5 million that will include both cash and stock  The transaction is anticipated to close on or around Jun 30  2016 but is awaiting approval from regulators 

	The to be acquired completion tools business is engaged in designing a variety of innovative and patented downhole tools that are used for multi stage fracturing and multi zone completions  The equipments are sold in North American markets and also outside the continent  Most importantly  with this purchase  National Oilwell will significantly broaden the scope of its completion and production business and could offer better services to customers   See More     

	4  Offshore drilling giant Transocean Ltd     has outbid its competitors for an offshore development in India at a time when drillers are facing rig contract terminations  The contract primarily helped Transocean to surge almost 15  on the NYSE 

	Transocean has entered into a 730 day contract with India s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited   ONGC   for one semi submersible rig that will likely be operating at a dayrate of  127 000  Though the dayrate being offered to Transocean is quite low but it s still better than keeping the rig idle 

	5  Hercules Offshore Inc      along with some of its affiliates  has filed chapter 11 proceedings under the U S  Bankruptcy Code for the District of Delaware after 99 7  of its first lien lenders voted to endorse the prepackaged bankruptcy plan 

	This is the second time that the Houston based operator of drilling rigs and liftboats has filed for bankruptcy  Hercules Offshore emerged from bankruptcy protection just six months ago  The company had filed for Chapter 11 in Aug 2015  wherein it called upon bondholders to swap  1 2 billion in debt for control of the company 

	Under the terms of the second bankruptcy plan  the company intends to shut down its business and sell all its assets to cover the payments to lenders  The remaining assets  if any  will be placed into a wind down vehicle and would remain operational until sales are finalized

161814,383330,NOV,VALX  A New Guru ETF That Mimics The All Time Greats,opinion,"When it comes to investing  originality is overrated  You get no brownie points for using only your own research  Returns are returns  So  if you can piggyback on the research of famous investors like  or Peter Lynch  why wouldn t you 

I ve spilt quite a bit of ink writing about assorted smart money  guru following strategies  see      all of which involve some variation of 13F mining  In a nutshell  if you want to know what a famous investor is buying  you need only look at the 13F filings they are required to file with the SEC  Several sites  including GuruFocus and Insider Monkey  track 13F filings  and there are currently three popular guru ETFs  including the Global X Top Guru Holdings  NYSE GURU   the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha  NYSE ALFA  and the Direxion iBillionaire Index ETF  IBLN  

Now  Validea Funds is taking the guru ETF in a new direction with the Validea Market Legends ETF  VALX  

VALX  unlike its peers  does not mine the 13F filings of famous investors  Instead  it picks stocks by imitating the strategies of famous investors  It s a matter of copying the style rather than the specific stocks 

There are pros and cons to following this kind of approach  One obvious selling point is that you are not limited to the current pool of famous investors  The strategies used by investing legends that practiced decades ago  such as Benjamin Graham or Peter Lynch  can be included alongside those of managers that are in the trenches today 

And there is also the matter of timing  The mining of 13F filings is an exercise in tracking what the smart money has already done  and by the time you get the information it might already be dated  By emulating the underlying strategy instead  you can potentially invest ahead of the manager whose strategy you are ostensibly cloning 

Of course  the obvious downside  particularly when looking at the strategies of long retired managers  is that we can t say with any certainty whether that manager would still be using those strategies were they in the business today  Many of Benjamin Graham s favorite strategies are all but unusable today because the market is a lot more efficient than it was when Graham was investing  If Graham were alive and practicing today  I have no doubt that he could compete with the very best value managers in the business  This is the man  after all  that literally invented value investing as we know it today with his publishing of The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis  But would he still be hunting for stocks trading below their net current asset value per share  as he was famous for doing during the Great Depression  We can only guess 

Let s take a look under the hood of VALX  This guru ETF s portfolio is comprised of 100 stocks using 10 distinct guru based models  which are themselves chosen from a pool of 17 total models  The original pool of 17 is narrowed down to 10 based on their long term performance and their correlation to each other 

VALX is not beholden to any one strategy type  its 17 identifiable strategies are a mixture of value  growth and momentum strategies  VALX is also not hemmed in by market cap restrictions  its holdings span the small  mid  and large cap universes 

So  what is VALX buying today  Let s take a look at the

161817,383333,NOV,Can Oil Stay This Low Forever ,opinion,"This week s Hot Stock is a leading worldwide provider of equipment to the energy industry  Energy stocks as a whole have been hit hard with the decline in energy prices  and NOV is no exception with the stock down 25  over the past year  However  this price decline is unwarranted  as National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  possesses particular qualities that allow it to weather this price decline better than most energy companies  This company s steady profit growth and diversified revenue streams  when coupled with its stock s gross undervaluation  allow it to earn our Very Attractive rating  This week s hot stock is National Oilwell Varco  NOV  

National Oilwell designs  manufactures  and sells equipment and components used in the building of oil and gas rigs  In addition  the company also provides aftermarket parts to rigs that it s already built  This aftermarket business garners high operating margins  27  in 2014  due to its focus on existing systems already created by the company  and is a support to existing rigs  Furthermore  the company also designs  sells  and rents equipment used in various processes on completed oil rigs  including drilling equipment  When viewed as a whole  National Oilwell s services and products serve the entire lifecycle of an oil rig  from construction to operation to maintenance  This complete business can be highly profitable  even in down times  When rigs start drilling again  National Oilwell will be able to supply the drilling equipment  provide maintenance to the aging rigs  and even begin building new rigs 

Overall  revenue in 2014 remained strong  increasing 12  year over year  While revenue growth may slower going forward  over the long term National Oilwell is in a good position to serve all aspects of an oil rebound  This revenue growth in 2014 allowed National Oilwell to grow its after tax profit    by 5  in 2014 over the prior year  Over the last five years  profit growth has been even stronger  growing at 11  compounded annually 

The company s return on invested capital    was 10  in 2014  slightly higher than the year before  Possibly best of all  National Oilwell had over  4 billion in  and only  3 8 billion in total debt in 2014  A strong balance sheet allows this company flexibility in tough times  Another positive sign is that the decline in oil prices is something we have seen before  and something that the industry has bounced back from 

Oil Price Anomaly  

In a nine month stretch in 2008 2009  the price of oil dropped over 73   only to rise 94  from the lows over the next five months  A similar situation occurred  even if of lesser magnitude over a six month stretch in 2011  The price of oil dropped 26  in mid 2011  only to rise more than 29  from the lows over the next six months  The most recent price decline  down 54  over the past eight months  may be just a blip on the radar six months from now 

As mentioned above  National Oilwell s stock price is down over 25  in the last year despite strength in the underlying business  Not being overexposed to one particular segment or location  NOV operates in 70 countries  of the oil industry gives the company even further strength  At its current price of   53 share  National Oilwell has a price to economic book value    ratio of 0 7  This ratio implies that the market expects National Oilwell s NOPAT permanently decline by 30   While 2015 may be a trying year  National Oilwell is positioned well to benefit greatly as soon as oil begins its turnaround  In the meantime  a  14 billion backlog and large existing base of rigs provide National Oilwell ample ability to withstand a prolonged oil price decline 

If National Oilwell can grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually for the next six years  the stock is worth  80 share    a 51  upside  With upside potential like this  it s easy to like NOV

161878,383394,NOV,Euro Rallies After ECB Rate Meeting,opinion,USDThe dollar fell on Thursday on a drying up of safety flows after the ECB decided to keep rates on hold at its monthly meeting leading to speculation of more positive outlook for the region  Unexpectedly positive trade data from China also helped lift sentiment after Exports rose by 14 1  when only a 5  rise had been expected and the Trade surplus rose to 31 6bn versus 201bn forecast   On the data front  New Jobless Claims  Jan  5  data showed a rise in claims to 371k from 367k previously when a fall to 365k had been expected but the small rise was dismissed as insignificant  Continuing Claims fell to 3109k from 3236k previously  JOLTs Job Openings  Nov  on the other hand rose to 3676 from 3665  Wholesale Inventories  Nov  rose by 0 6  from 0 3  previously when a fall to 0 2  had been expected EUR The euro rose on Thursday after the ECB decided by a unanimous vote to keep rates on hold  The decision upset expectations that the central bank would either take action or at least issue a more doveish message  A shock recent rise in unemployment and flat lining growth had stoked fears that the ECB would lower rates however  in the end this proved not the case  Mario Monti said in the press conference afterwards that he saw the outlook for inflation in 2013 as  balanced  but made no indication of policy direction   The euro also strengthened after borrowing costs for Italy and Spain fell markedly at bond auctions this morning  The yield for the Spanish 5 year fell to 3 98  from 4 68  in November and Spain s 10 year benchmark fell to a 10 month low of 4 67    GBP The pound rose on Thursday on a growing wave of risk appetite following positive global data and news that the BOE had kept rates unchanged at 0 5  and asset purchases on hold at 375bn  at their monthly meeting  As far as global data went  the day began positively for risky currencies after Spain and Italy managed to lower borrowing rates substantially at auction  with the yield on the Spanish 10 year falling to 4 67    a 10 month low   Chinese trade data also surprised investors by showing an unexpected rise in Exports to 14 1   when only 5  had been expected  and a rise in the trade surplus well above the 20 1bn expected  to 31 6bn  from only 19 6bn previously  Signs that the dragon was rising spurred a massive push higher for risk assets including sterling JPY The yen fell on Thursday after safe haven demand decreased following positive news from Europe and a less doveish message from European Central Bank which decided unanimously to keep rates on hold  Substantially lower borrowing costs at auctions of Italian and Spanish bonds also helped the outlook for the euro zone  Under par data in Japan  showing a fall in Leading Index and the Coincident Index which both fell to 99 1 and 90 1 respectively in November also weighed on the currency   The yen remains under pressure from background expectations that the BOJ will pursue more aggressive monetary policy measures given the pro easing stance of the new administration  Tonight key data will be released showing the Balance of Trade  which is expected to fall deeper to  832 0bn from  450 3bn previously ,2013-01-10,Forex4you,https://www.investing.com/analysis/euro-rallies-after-ecb-rate-meeting-150400,150400
161901,383417,NOV, Sterling  What s The BoE Thinking ,opinion,This is the big week for UK economic data  Tuesday s firm CPI figures were followed by somewhat better than expected employment data today and the MPC minutes  The slew of data concludes Thursday with July s retail sales  which are expected to be soft  Bloomberg consensus   0 1  on headline   The high frequency data does not change the overall picture of the UK economy  It has contracted for three consecutive quarters through Q2 s 0 7  contraction  which the MPC minutes echoed BoE Governor King in playing up one off factors  However  most of the forward looking data warns that the UK economy appears to be declining in Q3 even if it s at a slower pace Easing References The MPC minutes also dropped the explicit reference to rate cuts  King had already played down that option in favor or gilt purchases and funding for lending  The BoE is seeing some success in the scheme and noted that a number of banks have reduced lending rates for mortgages and small businesses  There was also discussion about extending the gilt purchase program  QE   Although no decision was made  further gilt purchases may be announced before the current program ends  Nov   The BoE s gilt purchases amount to roughly 25  of GDP  Fed bond purchases  in comparison  have been about 15  of GDP  while the ECB bond purchases are closer to 3  of GDP  Counter intuitively for many participants who expect QE to be negative for a currency  sterling s strength is a head wind for the UK economy and it was recognized as such in the MPC minutes  Since the middle of last year  sterling has appreciated almost 9  on the BoE s broad trade weighted measure  This is tantamount to some degree of tightening  The BoE expressed concern that sterling s strength was curbing export growth and the re balancing process  Since June 2009  when exports bottomed  they rose about 31  through last October  Since then exports have fallen almost 8  U S  Exports In comparison  the U S  dollar has appreciated 7  on the Fed s broad trade weighted index since the middle of last year  U S  exports have risen almost 50   48 8   since the early 2009 lows  recall Obama had set a goal of 50  growth in exports during his administration  and have risen about 4  since the Fed s trade weighted dollar index bottomed  Despite pursuing QE  the BoE is frustrated with the strength of sterling  On one hand  this dovetails well with our inductive argument that  not withstanding economic theory  QE has not been negative for the currencies of countries that pursue it  On the other hand  there is not much the UK appears prepared to do to resist sterling strength  Part of sterling s strength  after all reflects the euro s weakness  Against the dollar  sterling is flirting with its 200 day moving average  which comes in near  1 5721  Since the beginning of Q3  sterling has toyed with this moving average almost a dozen times and has yet to close above it  though intraday violation has taken place   This is occurring with the  1 54  1 58 trading range that has confined the price action for two months ,2012-08-15,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sterling:-what's-the-boe-thinking-133118,133118
