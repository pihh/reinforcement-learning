14530,236045,ATI,Why Is Allegheny Technologies  ATI  Down 23 3  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Allegheny Technologies  ATI   Shares have lost about 23 3  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Allegheny Technologies due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Allegheny s Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates in Q2Allegheny recorded net income of  75 1 million or 54 cents per share in second quarter 2019  up from a profit of  72 8 million or 52 cents in the prior year quarter Barring one time items  adjusted earnings per share came in at 40 cents and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents The company delivered revenues of  1 080 4 million in the quarter  up roughly 7  year over year  Also  the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 060 7 million Segment HighlightsIn the second quarter  revenues in the HPMC segment rose around 8 5  year over year to  642 4 million  The upside can be attributed to higher demand for titanium based products  Also  sales in the aerospace and defense markets were 17  higher from the year ago quarter s level  Notably  commercial airframe market sales surged 40  year over year  Operating profit in the unit rose around 1  year over year to  98 9 million    The FRP segment s sales rose around 5  year over year to  438 million  Per the company  sales of high value products more than offset lower sales of standard products  Operating profit in the division totaled  15 6 million  which declined 40 2  year over year  The downside reflects higher retirement benefit expenses and loss for Allegheny s share in the A T Stainless joint venture stemming from the Section 232 tariffs   Financial PositionAllegheny ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  281 2 million  up more than two folds year over year  Long term debt rose to  1 537 1 million from  1 535 5 million in the year ago quarter Net cash used in operating activities was  104 4 million for the first six months of 2019 OutlookFor the HPMC unit  the company stated that demand for single aisle platforms remains strong  However  it expects uneven order patterns along with inventory management actions by a major aero engine customer to negatively impact shipments in the second half of 2019  This will partly lower the benefit from larger share of high value commercial jet engine materials and components   For the FRP segment  the company expects consistent profitability in the second half of 2019 on the back of improved customer demand for high value products  including the U S  and for the STAL joint venture  Also  higher carbon conversion volumes and favorable raw material surcharge value are expected to drive performance in the segment  The company is focused on sustaining profitability by increasing asset utilization of its Hot Rolling and Processing Facility as well as improving the product mix  
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  22 04  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
Currently  Allegheny Technologies has an average Growth Score of C  though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D  However  the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side  putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Allegheny Technologies has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-08-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-allegheny-technologies-ati-down-233-since-last-earnings-report-200457675,200457675
14531,236046,ATI,Earnings Preview  Allegheny Technologies  ATI  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Allegheny Technologies  ATI  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of steel and specialty metals is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 8  
Revenues are expected to be  993 45 million  down 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allegheny Technologies 
For Allegheny Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 06  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Allegheny Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allegheny Technologies would post earnings of  0 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 40  delivering a surprise of  14 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allegheny Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-allegheny-technologies-ati-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200477647,200477647
14532,236047,ATI,Allegheny Technologies  ATI  Matches Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Allegheny Technologies  ATI  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 37 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of steel and specialty metals would post earnings of  0 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 40  delivering a surprise of 14 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Allegheny Technologies  which belongs to the Zacks Steel   Speciality industry  posted revenues of  1 02 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 54   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 02 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Allegheny Technologies shares have lost about 11 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 5  
What s Next for Allegheny Technologies 
While Allegheny Technologies has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Allegheny Technologies was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 43 on  1 02 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 26 on  4 09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Steel   Speciality is currently in the bottom 26  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allegheny-technologies-ati-matches-q3-earnings-estimates-200480790,200480790

14537,236052,ATI,Supporting Trump Tariffs  One Exemption at a Time,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Robert Wetherbee  CEO of steelmaker Allegheny Technologies  NYSE ATI  Inc   has penned an op ed in the Wall Street Journal sporting a headline for the ages 
I Support Trump s Tariffs But Need An Exemption
It s tough to know if this is merely a straight summation of the piece  which it is  or the pointed effort of some wag on the copy desk  Either way  as pithy distillations of the tricky trade offs of tariffs go  it is tough to beat 
Allegheny s management wasn t always so down on the trade war  Back in the summer of 2017  some months before President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  Wetherbee s predecessor Richard Harshman told analysts on an earnings call that tariffs held  direct upside potential  for the company   By early 2018  however  it became clear that semi finished slabs from Indonesia needed by Allegheny s A T stainless steel joint venture were swept up by the new trade broom  The company filed for an exemption in March of that year  a request that was denied last April 
Wetherbee s op ed looks like another attempt  albeit with different paperwork  After acknowledging the wisdom of Trump s approach in broad terms  read the headline   it then calls tariffs  blunt instruments  that will force the closure of a Pennsylvania plant  risking 300 direct and indirect jobs in a  vital swing state    That sound you just heard is the sledgehammer of subtlety being hurled at the Oval Office   It goes on to say that only three companies in the U S  produce those slabs  but that doesn t help because they are direct competitors who have  zero interest  in helping Allegheny prosper  which sounds par for the course  really   The piece closes with a plaintive  Mr  President  we implore you  Save our jobs  
On the one hand  the U S  has legitimate trade grievances with China  and commodity industries such as steel are at the bleeding edge of that  Utilization at steel plants has risen since the trade war began  according to a recent report from ClearView Energy Partners 
On the other hand  decades of globalization championed by the very superpower now decrying it have created webs of supply chains that are fiendishly hard to unravel  Case in point  Indonesian semi finished slabs   who knew  Hence  while everyone in the chosen field supports the blunt instrument in principle  the complex realities beneath demand an edifice of waivers be built  with tariffs generally agreed to work best when they affect one s competitors only 
Leaving aside Allegheny s specific woes  the price of protecting steelworkers from foreign competition via tariffs is  as with most any product  higher prices for consumers  In our populist age  that is a price Americans may be willing to vote for again  Besides that gorgeous headline  Wetherbee s op ed is a timely reminder that the recent sigh of relief in financial markets about the phase one trade agreement with China looks premature  Given the depth and breadth of the Sino U S  rivalry   with geopolitical aspects far beyond mere tariffs and bipartisan antipathy to Beijing   the deal is more partial ceasefire than treaty 
Moreover  it has sprung up in the middle of Trump s impeachment saga and the final stretch of the 2020 election  It s very hard to predict how the president will balance a desire to keep stocks humming with an impulse to deliver on years of tough talk about Beijing  Speaking publicly on Thursday morning  he mentioned again the notion that  phase two  might have to wait until after November  For anyone worried  call your representative  Or write an op ed ",2020-01-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/supporting-trump-tariffs-one-exemption-at-a-time-2056258,2056258

14542,236057,ATI,As Trump Touts Steel Revival  Investors Still Await Payoff,news," Bloomberg     A lot of investors seem to have lost the memo on the revival of the American steel industry 
U S  President Donald Trump took to Twitter to boast about new plants amid robust demand  While he s right that the industry is thriving  it s also worth noting that gains in steel stocks since the U S  announced import tariffs on the metal have trailed the broader market 
Donald J  Trump realDonaldTrumpOur Steel Industry is the talk of the World  It has been given new life  and is thriving  Billions of Dollars is being spent on new plants all around the country 
Sent via Twitter for iPhone 
View original tweet 
Some U S  plants have been restarted  and a Federal Reserve report showed steel and iron ore output has risen for 15 straight months  But in a year in which tariffs have helped fuel a 32 percent surge in domestic steel prices  U S  producers  shares have struggled amid investor concerns over the demand outlook and a lack of confidence in the higher steel prices  said analysts including Phil Gibbs at Keybanc Capital Markets 
 People are fearful of global demand being hurt with all this trade friction with China  and fearful that input costs are rising at a very rapid pace   Gibbs said by phone   High prices can be good for short term profits  but higher prices can also stymie demand  If that happens  steel being a global demand proxy is right in the crosshairs  
The S P Supercomposite Steel Index of 13 producers is down more than 8 percent since the levies were announced on March 1  compared with an 8 percent gain for the broader S P 500 Index  The steelmaker gauge is little changed this year 
Trump has made blue collar industries like coal and steel a centerpiece of his platform  promising a return to the days of rapid expansion in U S  manufacturing  The S P gauge of steelmaker shares is up more than 30 percent since Trump won the November 2016 election  compared with about 36 percent for the broader equity market 
In addition to gains on Trump s promise for   bold action  to stem a flood of imports from China  the domestic industry has benefited the past few years from a resilient global economy and a series of anti dumping measures handed down from the Obama administration  The S P steelmakers gauge rose 71 percent in 2016 
 At the very least  the tweet is more right than wrong   Jeremy Sussman  an analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities  said in a telephone interview from New York   Steel imports are down  and prices are up  The spread between U S  and the world steel prices is at a historical high level  which we believe is in large part due to the tariffs  
Mixed Bag
Trump said in a separate tweet that tariffs have put the U S  in  a very strong bargaining position   with jobs and billions of dollars flowing to the U S 
Still  a mixed bag of results last quarter left investors wondering if they would see any real benefit from Trump s trade policies  While Pittsburgh based U S  Steel Corp  raised its 2018 earnings forecast on Aug  1 after a better than expected second quarter  it gave a third quarter projection that trailed the average analyst estimate  and kept dividends unchanged 
 Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  downgraded U S  Steel later last month  saying the steel market s cycle peak is  now behind us   U S  Steel shares are down 36 percent since March 1  the worst performance in the S P steelmakers index  AK Steel Holding Corp    Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE   and TimkenSteel Corp  are also down in that span 
Other companies have fared better  Cleveland Cliffs Inc   the top U S  iron ore producer  has surged about 50 percent since the tariffs were announced  while Allegheny Technologies  NYSE ATI  Inc  is up more 7 than percent 
 The group as whole is generally up but are down from their recent peak  and I would argued that s because hot rolled steel pricing is now down from the peak   Clarksons Platou s Sussman said

14553,236068,ATI,Analysts Estimate Allegheny Technologies  ATI  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Allegheny Technologies  ATI  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of steel and specialty metals is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  40 6  
Revenues are expected to be  978 35 million  down 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 62  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allegheny Technologies 
For Allegheny Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Allegheny Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allegheny Technologies would post earnings of  0 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 30  delivering a surprise of  9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allegheny Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-allegheny-technologies-ati-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200407322,200407322
14554,236069,ATI,Allegheny Technologies  ATI  Matches Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Allegheny Technologies  ATI  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 12 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 32 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of steel and specialty metals would post earnings of  0 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 30  delivering a surprise of  9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Allegheny Technologies  which belongs to the Zacks Steel   Speciality industry  posted revenues of  1 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 70   This compares to year ago revenues of  979 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Allegheny Technologies shares have added about 17 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16  
What s Next for Allegheny Technologies 
While Allegheny Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Allegheny Technologies was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 40 on  1 06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 78 on  4 23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

14582,236097,ATI,Allegheny Technologies  ATI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Allegheny Technologies  NYSE ATI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of steel and specialty metals is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 34 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 9  
Revenues are expected to be  982 46 million  up 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 14  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allegheny Technologies 
For Allegheny Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 16  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Allegheny Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allegheny Technologies would post earnings of  0 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 37  delivering a surprise of  5 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allegheny Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allegheny-technologies-ati-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200375759,200375759

Boeing Co  United Technologies Corp and Airbus Group NV buy a substantial share of their titanium requirement from VSMPO Avisma Corp  WSJ reported    
Efforts to stock up on titanium parts began in March 2014  after the annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russia triggered tensions between Moscow and Western governments  the newspaper said 
Representatives at Boeing and United Technologies did not immediately respond to Reuters  request for comment outside regular U S  business hours 
In response to the conflict in Ukraine  the United States has for several months been leveled sanctions on Russian individuals and smaller companies

Companies in the Eurozone have also felt the pinch of the standoff

14624,236139,ATI,Allegheny Technologies  ATI  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Allegheny Technologies  ATI  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of steel and specialty metals is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  36 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 07 billion  up 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 69  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allegheny Technologies 
For Allegheny Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 03  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Allegheny Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allegheny Technologies would post earnings of  0 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 12  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allegheny Technologies appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allegheny-technologies-ati-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200440214,200440214

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14 29   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of steel and specialty metals would post earnings of  0 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 12  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Allegheny Technologies  which belongs to the Zacks Steel   Speciality industry  posted revenues of  1 08 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 86   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 01 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Allegheny Technologies shares have added about 15 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 1  
What s Next for Allegheny Technologies 
While Allegheny Technologies has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

104141,325656,ATI,What To Expect From United Technologies   UTX  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"United Technologies Corporation   NYSE UTX   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 24  before the opening bell  The company is likely to report higher revenues in the impending quarterly results  owing to overall favorable macroeconomic environment and strong demand 
United Technologies has a decent earnings surprise history  having trumped estimates in the trailing four quarters for an average beat of 4 1   In the last reported quarter  the company pulled off a positive surprise of 2 6  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Revenues of the company are largely affected by spending in the U S  military and commercial aviation industries  An increase in demand for the company s products in these industries is expected to favorably impact its financial performance  which will be reflected in the upcoming results 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2018 revenues is pegged at  14 537 million  higher than reported revenues of  13 815 million in the prior year quarter  Revenues across Otis  Pratt   Whitney and Aerospace Systems segments are expected to increase year over year to  2 875 million   4 280 million and  3 642 million from  2 804 million   3 758 million and  3 611 million  respectively  UTC Climate  Controls   Security revenues are expected to come in at  4 087 million  up from  3 892 million in the year ago quarter 
In September 2017  United Technologies announced its plans to acquire Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL   an Iowa based avionics firm  Post the acquisition  United Technologies is expected to emerge as one of the world s largest aircraft equipment manufacturers  The acquisition  slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018  will provide a huge competitive advantage to the company and increase its bargaining power  The resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs 
The merger is expected to be a huge boost to the company s revenues and adjusted earnings per share after the first year of combined operations with synergies worth more than  500 million  Although the transaction will not have any direct impact on earnings in the quarter  it is likely to attract similar profitable deals for the company that will augment overall revenues in the quarter 
Separately  the strong aftermarket business that sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running is likely to record a healthy growth momentum with uptick in the economy  Furthermore  continued focus on four key priorities to fuel its growth momentum  namely flawless execution  innovation for growth  structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation is likely to translate to improved performance in the quarter 
United Technologies Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   However  the company registered significant margin contraction in fourth quarter 2017  as rise in operating expenses overshadowed top line growth  If the operating expenses continue to reflect upward momentum  margins for the quarter under review will be pressurized 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not show that United Technologies is likely to beat estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The company s Earnings ESP is  0 75   as the Most Accurate estimate is  1 50 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 51  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
Zacks Rank  United Technologies has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

104173,325688,ATI,China Pushes Up Global Steel Output Amid Trade War Tensions,opinion,Global crude steel production expanded in February on the back of a surge in output in China  the world s biggest steel maker  despite Beijing s efforts to curb output during winter months to streamline its burgeoning steel sector and mounting trade tensions with the United States  Higher output from India  which pipped Japan as the second largest steel producer  also supported the production growth According to the latest report from the World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   crude steel production for 64 reporting nations went up 3 5  year over year for the reported month to 131 8 million tons  Mt   This follows a paltry 0 8  increase in January Chinese Steel Mills Ramp Up OutputProduction from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  spiked 5 9  year over year to 64 9 Mt in February as steel mills in the country took advantage of higher domestic steel prices that translates to higher profits for the Chinese steel industry Chinese steel output was expected to decline during winter months as Beijing had implemented a four month reduction in production to reduce the country s excess steel supply and clean up the environment  Production is expected to rise further moving ahead as those winter restrictions ended earlier this month The rise in production in February also came amid escalating trade tensions between the United States and China  The Trump administration has slapped a 25  tariff on steel imports with China being one of the main targets of the punitive trade action   While China only accounts for 2  of U S  steel imports  it has been repeatedly accused of dumping its excess steel capacity  Notably  President Trump has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices  This is well reflected in his plans to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from China worth as much as  60 billion  announced last week     Beijing has also responded with plans to levy tariffs on a range of American products with U S  export value of  3 billion in 2017  including a 15  tariff on steel pipes  Nevertheless  the world s two largest economies are reportedly in talks to avert a full blown trade war How Other Major Producers Fared in February Among other major Asian producers  India saw a 3 4  rise in production to 8 4 Mt in February  Indian steel mills have been benefiting from higher domestic steel prices and increasing local demand Production in Japan slipped 0 5  to 8 3 Mt in February following a 0 3  rise a month ago  South Korea also witnessed a 2 1  decline to 5 4 Mt  Consolidated output were up 4 3  to 90 5 Mt in Asia In North America  crude steel production rose 0 4  to 6 4 Mt in the United States  This follows a 2 2  decrease in production in January  The rebound came as American steel mills benefited from higher domestic steel prices Moving ahead  the trade tariffs are expected to boost production capacity of U S  steel makers amid lower imports  The U S  Department of Commerce had said that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80  operating rate from its present 73  capacity On prospects of higher steel demand as a result of the U S  trade measures  U S  Steel Corp    NYSE X   said recently that it will restart one of its Granite City Works blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities  Another U S  steel major  Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE   also recently said that it will build a rebar micro mill in Florida  This  240 million investment will be Nucor s second rebar micro mill Meanwhile  output in Canada skid 10 4  to around 1 Mt in February  Overall production for the region was down 2 3  to roughly 9 1 Mt   In the Europe Union  production from Germany   the biggest producer in the region   fell 3 2  to 3 3 Mt  Output went up 4 5  in Italy to 2 1 Mt while rising 1  to 1 3 Mt in France  Spain saw a 0 4  increase to 1 1 Mt  Total output fell 0 8  in the European Union to 13 4 Mt Output in the Middle East climbed 19  to 2 9 Mt with Iran  the top producer in the region  seeing a 48 6  surge to 2 1 Mt  Africa logged a 4  gain to 1 1 Mt in the reported month Among other notable producers  production from Turkey was up 8 7  to 3 Mt  Output from Brazil  the largest producer in South America  rose 5 5  to 2 7 Mt Crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the reporting countries was 73 3  in February  up from 71 5  a year ago and 72 8  in the previous month Steel Sector on the MendThe steel industry has staged a recovery after being out of favor for long  The industry enjoyed a good run in 2017 notwithstanding a few lingering challenges  Continued momentum in the automotive space and a recovery across housing and commercial construction markets have been key tailwinds for the steel industry  The automotive and construction industries will continue to provide the backbone to the industry The  has outperformed the broader market in a year s time  The industry has gained around 13 2  in this period  higher than the S P 500 s corresponding return of around 10 8  While the overall demand fundamentals for steel is improving  the industry is still challenged by sustained overcapacity  The global steel industry continues to reel under the effects of excess capacity    the biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability Steel Stocks to Watch ForA few stocks worth considering in the steel space are Tenaris S A    NYSE TS    Allegheny Technologies Incorporated   NYSE ATI   and Salzgitter Aktiengesellschaft   OTC SZGPY    While both Tenaris and Allegheny sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Salzgitter is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Tenaris has an expected

realization for the quarter to be roughly  75 per long ton  much lower than  83 4 recorded last quarter  Per the company  reasons for lower price realization include factors like lower reported volume driven by the winter shipping restrictions  negative carry over effects and an unfavorable customer mix dominated by rail delivery The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues for the first

104178,325693,ATI,Verizon  VZ  Q1 Earnings  What Lies Ahead For The Stock ,opinion,Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is scheduled to release first quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24  The company is likely to record higher revenues from the Wireless segment  which accounts for the lion s share of total revenues  on a year over year basis Whether this will benefit the bottom line of the company remains to be seen Top Line ExpansionVerizon offers one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States  The telecom behemoth is continuously investing in wireless and wireline fiber optic networks  Verizon plans to launch next generation 5G wireless residential broadband services in three to five U S  markets in 2018  The first commercial launch is scheduled in Sacramento  CA  in the second half of 2018 During the first application of 5G wireless network  Verizon will be using millimeter wave spectrum  radio signals  instead of copper or fiber cables to provide customers with unmatched wireless speeds for Internet access  Verizon has started conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with partners  The company is looking at mobile hotspot and home based fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the country in 2018  A full phased 5G wireless network is likely to be offered in 2020 At the same time  Verizon is systematically diversifying itself as a major player in the digital content and online advertising space  The company has formed a new division called Oath to oversee assets of Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  and AOL  including more than 20 brands like Yahoo News  HuffPost  Engadget  TechCrunch  Yahoo Finance  Yahoo Sports and Tumblr Buoyed by such tailwinds  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wireless segment s revenues in the to be reported quarter is currently pegged at  21 315 million  which is relatively higher than the year ago tally of  20 878 million  The higher revenue expectations can be attributed to an uptick in demand and an upgrade to state of the art infrastructure Total revenues for the company are expected to be  31 141 million compared with  29 814 million in the prior year quarter Other Key FactorsOn the other hand  the U S  telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition  as success to a great extent depends on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  The wireless industry is likely to witness more competition in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs  multi service operators   Adoption of several unlimited data plans will likely result in lower average revenue per user  Spectrum crunch has also become a major issue in the U S  telecom industry  Most of the carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage mobile data traffic  which is growing by leaps and bounds  The situation has become even more acute with the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as rising online mobile video streaming  cloud computing and video conferencing services In an effort to expand its customer base  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and is also offering lucrative discounts  These strategies are likely to impact the company s EBITDA and EBITDA service margins in the quarter  Revenues from the Wireline segment are likely to be  7 603 million  down from  7 876 million owing to competitive pressure from voice over Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple play  voice  data  video  offerings by cable companies  In order to make Wireline profitable  Verizon is making significant investments and is streamlining its cost structure  These are likely to weigh on the company s revenues and margins Our proven model does not conclusively show that Verizon is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 27

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ATI due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Allegheny s Earnings   Revenues Top Estimates in Q4Allegheny reported net earnings of  1 7 million or a penny per share for fourth quarter 2017  compared with  9 9 million or 9 cents per share recorded a year ago Barring one time items  adjusted earnings came in at 27 cents per share for the quarter  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents Revenues for the quarter rose 14  year over year to  910 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  904 5 million FY17 ResultsFor full year 2017  the company reported net loss of  91 9 million  or 83 cents per share  compared with a prior year loss of  640 9 million  or  5 97  Adjusted earnings for the year came in at  54 6 million or 48 cents per share  as against adjusted loss of  97 4 million or 91 cents recorded a year ago Allegheny reported revenues of  3 5 billion in 2017  up around 13  from  3 13 billion reported in 2016 Segment HighlightsRevenues from the HPMC segment improved 9  year over year to  517 7 million in the fourth quarter due to higher sales of forged and cast components and nickel based and specialty alloys Operating profit increased to  65 8 million from  53 8 million in the prior year quarter  The segment s profit reflects higher productivity from increasing aerospace and defense sales  an improved product mix of next generation nickel alloys and forgings for the aero engine market and benefits of the 2016 titanium operation restructuring activities FRP segment s sales rose 23  year over year to  392 2 million on the back of higher shipment volume for both high value products and modestly higher selling prices of standard stainless and high value products The segment s operating profit came in at  22 4 million as against the year ago quarter loss of  0 8 million  Results reflect favorable impact of an improved product mix  especially titanium and nickel alloy products  and more stable prices of raw materials Financial PositionAllegheny s cash in hand as of Dec 31  2017 was  142 million  down 38 3  year over year  Long term debt fell 13 6  to  1 530 6 million The company generated operating cash flows of  76 million in the quarter

104225,325740,ATI,5 Solid Steel Stocks That Thumped The S P 500 In 2017,opinion,"The steel industry staged a recovery this year after being out of favor for long  The highly cyclical industry enjoyed a good run in 2017 notwithstanding a few lingering challenges     The steel industry has outperformed the broader market  S P 500  year to date  The industry has gained around 23  so far this year  topping the S P 500 s corresponding return of roughly 18 9  

 
While the overall demand fundamentals for steel is improving  the industry is still challenged by sustained overcapacity  The global steel industry continues to reel under the effects of excess capacity   the biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability Upturn in Steel DemandThe World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   sees global steel demand to expand 7  in 2017 following a 1  rise in 2016  Steel consumption in China is expected to go up 12 4  this year as closure of most of its outdated induction furnaces are expected to lead to a jump in steel use  Global steel demand barring China is expected to rise 2 6  in 2017 A cyclical upturn in steel demand this year has been backed by strong economic momentum across advanced and developing economies  The U S  economy is showing strong fundamentals on the back of improving business confidence and healthy consumer spending  Steel demand in the United States is expected to rise 4 8  this year Moreover  Eurozone s economic recovery continues apace  as evident from recent upbeat economic data  The region s recovery is backed by declining unemployment and strengthening business and consumer confidence  The WSA sees steel demand in the European Union to go up 2 5  in 2017 Demand in emerging and developing economies  barring China  is also expected to rise 2 8  this year  Developing economies are gaining from an upturn in the world economy and economic reforms across several countries including India and Brazil Steel Glut a Concern  but China Winter Cuts to Tighten OutputThe global steel industry continued bear the brunt of a surge in production in China this year as steel mills in the world s biggest steel producing nation continued to take advantage of a spike in domestic steel prices that translates to higher profits for the Chinese steel industry According to the WSA  global crude steel production went up 5 6  year over year during the first ten months of 2017  Output from China  which accounts for around half of the global production  climbed 6 1  year over year during this period  Nevertheless  Chinese steel output is expected to decline moving ahead as Beijing has started implementing a four month reduction in production to streamline its burgeoning steel sector and control pollution during the winter months  lasting until the middle of March 2018   The Hebei province   China s top steel producing region   is looking to shutter 50  of its steel capacity during winter in a bid to clean up the environment Overall  China is expected to cut its steel production capacity by around 50 million metric tons in 2017  The country s actions to reduce its excess steel supply during winter are also expected to lend support to global steel prices moving ahead  This is also expected to tighten global steel output in the coming months Imports   A Pressing Problem for U S  MillsU S  steel mills have been hit by a renewed tide of cheap imports this year  Imports of subsidized steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions  in the form of heavy tariffs  and threats of further future measures Total steel imports shot up roughly 19  to around 32 9 million net tons through the first ten months of 2017   according to the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   an association of North American steel makers  Finished steel imports for the same period also increased roughly 15  to around 25 4 million net tons  per the AISI While positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States  imports from other countries remain at above historical levels According to AISI data  steel imports from China fell roughly 6  year over year through the first ten months of 2017  However  imports from other countries such as Russia  Taiwan  Germany  South Korea and Brazil have spiked over this period A surge in steel imports put pressure on U S  steel prices during third quarter 2017  Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the quarter Much Hopes Pinned on Section 232U S  steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel  The Trump administration  in April 2017  ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security However  the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe  which was initially expected at the end of June 2017  The Commerce Department has until mid January 2018 to conclude the investigation  A delay in the Section 232 probe has triggered a spike in steel imports into the American market in the recent months As the deadline for the probe approaches  a positive outcome will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad based trade actions  in the form of tariffs or quotas  against cheap imports  This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power 5 Market Beating Steel StocksThe steel industry has fared well this year outperforming the broader market  despite the headwinds still plaguing the

While only 11  of the S P 500 member companies have reported  one sector that has outperformed has been materials  So far these companies have reported total earnings growth of 31 6  on 12 0  revenue growth while 100  have beat their estimates  These materials stocks have seen a positive 1 1  price impact immediately following earnings which compares favorably to the  0 6  impact for the entire 57 company group that has reported thus far 
Here are five stocks in the materials sector that are fundamentally undervalued and ready to takeoff on earnings 
5 Materials Stocks That Could Takeoff On Earnings
Using this   we found five materials stocks expected to report earnings this week  4 24 4 28  that are trading below their finbox io fair value estimate  Allegheny Technologies Incorporated  NYSE ATI   Owens Illinois  NYSE OI   Carpenter Technology Corporation  NYSE CRS   Coeur Mining Inc  NYSE CDE  and Huntsman Corporation  NYSE HUN  
Allegheny Technologies Incorporated produces and sells specialty materials and components worldwide  The company is expected to report earnings on Tuesday before the market opens and appears 30  undervalued when applying Wall Street estimates to seven separate cash flow analyses
 
Owens Illinois manufactures and sells glass containers to food and beverage manufacturers worldwide  The company is expected to report earnings on Monday after the market closes  Although shares currently trade near their 52 week high  the stock still has roughly 15  upside purely on a fundamental basis 
 
Carpenter Technology manufactures  fabricates  and distributes specialty metals worldwide and is expected to report earnings on Monday before the market opens  Finbox io s  39 27 intrinsic value estimate is right in line with Wall Street s  39 33 target which implies over 12  upside 
Coeur Mining owns  operates  explores for  and develops silver and gold properties  Earnings are expected to be reported on Wednesday after the market closes while nine cash flow models imply 12  upside  This is well below the  12 39 average price target derived from nine Wall Street analysts suggesting the stock is 30  undervalued 

Huntsman manufactures and sells differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products worldwide  The company recently announced the spin off of its pigments   additives segment on September 7  2016 which is expected to close in the first half of this year  The reasoning for the spin off is that Venator Materials  SpinCo  is expected to command a higher valuation
However  on a combined basis Huntsman still appears fundamentally undervalued  Expect an update on the spin off when the company reports earnings on Wednesday before the market opens 
These stocks in the materials sector all have strong fundamentals and could easily trade higher following a positive earnings announcement

CommentaryThe French Fly continued apace as financial markets continued to celebrate  In my previous post  I failed to post a chart of the iShares MSCI France  NYSE EWQ  

The French Fly caused an impressive breakout to a near 3 year high for the iShares MSCI France  EWQ  


The monthly chart of EWQ shows the tremendous upside potential for EWQ in a recovery scenario 
The major relief from the first round of the French Presidential election  what I call the French Fly  pushed EWQ to a major breakout to a near 3 year high  Yet  as I pointed out in my last  Above the 40  in discussing the lack of apparent fear in the euro  EWQ showed very little trepidation about the election  Indeed  going into the election  EWQ bounced near support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  and even at one point traded at a near 3 year high before fading a bit 
In other words  I am hard pressed to find evidence in the expected places that financial markets held authentic fear surrounding events in France  I am even more interested now in the bull story for France  and Europe in general  because of the tremendous upside potential of a growing recovery story 
On the other side of the Atlantic  the U S  market continued its own celebration as it apparently chose to focus on positive U S  headlines about tax reform and the likely avoidance of a government shutdown 
The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained 0 6  and closed above its upper Bollinger Band  BB   At its height  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  hit 68 6  before settling in at 67 2   With the index so stretched at the same time that AT40 traded near overbought levels  I decided it was a good time to lock in profits on my ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  shares and call options 
Note well that I remain bullish  but I prefer to to buy the next dip with conditions already looking a bit stretched  Also note that AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  closed at a new 6 week high and broke out above a wide trading range 
The S P 500  SPY  prints follow through that confirmed Monday s bullish breakout  Can buyers keep up the pressure well above the upper Bollinger Band 
The volatility index  the VIX  apparently also stretched to a limit  At its lowest point  the VIX hit 10 2  A close there would have made a new 10 year closing low  Instead  the VIX matched a near 3 year low as it bounced to close at 10 8  The VIX was so low  I decided to load up on a hedged play on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  with put options expiring this week and call options expiring next week 
Did the volatility index  the VIX  reach its limit 
The day was a bullish day for industrial type stocks  Nothing says BULL like a post earnings gap up from Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   CAT gained an amazing 7 9  and closed at a 2 1 2 year high  I was so impressed that I put in a low ball order to buy call options  they never closed  
Caterpillar  CAT  cleared a major hurdle with this post earnings breakout 
Terex Corporation  NYSE TEX   the  poor man s CAT   printed its own breakout  partially in sympathy with CAT  partially in response to a strong upgrade from JP Morgan  TEX is now on my list to buy on dips 

Terex  TEX  cleared its own major hurdle with a breakout above a significant trading range  consolidation  
An industrial stock I already own  Allegheny Technologies Incorporated  NYSE ATI   made a bullish move breaking out above its 50DMA resistance which also confirmed 200DMA support 

The recent slide seems to be over for Allegheny Technologies Incorporated  ATI  as it broke out for a 9 9  gain 
Traders and investors have almost restored financials to a bullish position  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  rallied right to the mid February breakout line after failing at its high at 50DMA resistance  This battle is an important one  A close above the 50DMA would confirm the market s refreshed bullishness 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  closed right on the edge of its own major breakout 
Finally  the U S  dollar index  DXY0  closed at the edge of a major breakdown  The dollar s 200DMA support has not been tested since the day after the U S  Presidential election  The dollar last closed below this critical trendline on October 4th 
Follow through on this crack of support could change the flavor of the market  The premise of a strong U S  economy and a strong U S  dollar may get tested here and flip to a new theme of weaker dollar and stronger exports equals yet more gains for U S  stocks  Stay tuned on that one 
The U S  dollar s grinding decline from the previous 14 year high continues  The last close confirmed the downtrend with a new lower low following lower highs

104323,325838,ATI,5 Material Stocks Ready To Jump On Earnings,opinion,"Q1 17 Earnings Season  Best Since 2011
The Q1 17 earnings season continues to be a story of growth so far  According to Zack s Investment Research  181 members of the S P 500 have reported as of Wednesday  April 26  Total earnings from these companies have grown 10 0  in Q1 17 compared to 7 0  in Q4 16  Revenues are also up 4 3  in compared to 2 4  in the previous quarter  Additionally  75 7  of these companies have also beat their EPS estimates while 64 1  have beaten their revenue estimates  This compares favorably to the rolling 12 quarter average beat percentage for EPS and revenues of 71 8  and 55 8   respectively 
Overall  S P 500 member earnings are on pace to reach their highest level since 2011 
Materials Sector Continues To Outperform
While only 36  of the S P 500 member companies have reported  one sector that has outperformed has been materials  So far these companies have reported total earnings growth of 47 7  while 75  have beat their estimates  These materials stocks have seen a positive 2 3  price impact immediately following earnings which compares favorably to the 0 3  impact for the entire 181 company group that has reported thus far 
We reported previously how the materials sector outperformed when earnings season first kicked off last week and highlighted 5 stocks ready to follow suit  A week later  four of the five material companies we named are up 7 8   on average  following their earnings release 
Allegheny Technologies  NYSE NYSE ATI  increased 8 9   Owens Illinois NYSE NYSE OI  moved up 6 3   Carpenter Technology  NYSE CRS  moved 11 3  higher and Huntsman  NYSE HUN  increased 4 5  while Coeur Mining  NYSE CDE  lost 3 6  
In case you missed out  here are another five stocks in the materials sector that are fundamentally undervalued and ready to jump on earnings 
5 Material Stocks That Could Jump On Earnings
We found five stocks classified in the materials sector that are expected to report earnings this week  5 1 5 5  and are trading below their finbox io fair value estimate  Flotek Industries  NYSE FTK   Rayonier Advanced Materials  NYSE RYAM   U S  Concrete  NASDAQ USCR    Haynes  NASDAQ HAYN  and Koppers  NYSE KOP  
Flotek develops and supplies chemistry and services to the oil and gas industries worldwide  The company is expected to report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes and appears highly undervalued when applying Wall Street estimates to seven separate cash flow analyses 
Originally a spin off from Rayonier  NYSE RYN  in 2014  Rayonier Advanced Materials manufactures and sells cellulose specialty products worldwide  The company is expected to report earnings on Monday after the market closes  Finbox io s  17 50 intrinsic value estimate is slightly above Wall Street s  16 25 target and both imply over 20  upside 
U S  Concrete produces ready mixed concrete and concrete related products for the construction industry in the United States and is expected to report earnings on Thursday before the market opens  Six separate valuation models imply 30  upside which is slightly above the  80 71 average price target derived from seven Wall Street analysts 
Haynes develops  manufactures and distributes nickel and cobalt based alloys in sheet  coil  and plate forms worldwide  Earnings are expected to be reported on Thursday  While shares currently trade right at their 200 day moving average  the stock appears roughly 25  undervalued purely on a fundamental basis 
Koppers sells treated wood products  wood treatment chemicals  and carbon compounds in the U S  and internationally  Although the stock is trading near its 52 week high  shares still look to have some upside potential going into earnings 
These stocks in the materials sector all have strong fundamentals and could easily trade higher following a positive earnings announcement 
If the first two weeks of the Q1 17 earnings season is any indicator for how the materials sector is going to perform  investors may want to take a closer look at these names prior to them reporting ",2017-04-28,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-material-stocks-ready-to-jump-on-earnings-200185955,200185955
104361,325876,ATI,Steel Macro Trends May Not Drive Grain Oriented Electrical Steel,opinion,"Many grain oriented electrical steel market participants know that macroeconomic drivers and general steel price trends often diverge from GOES trends 
Comments from the most recent Steel Market Update summit at the end of August suggest it may be hard to  buck the trend  
Macro Trends
What are these macro trends 

Steel demand looks weak overall and overcapacity will continue unabated  According to Tony Taccone  Partner at First River Consulting   global steel demand has stalled and there will be no growth going forward   In addition  Taccone indicated the world has 700 million metric tons of overcapacity and the problem is set to become worse 
Trade cases will put the kabash on Chinese export growth  China has produced too much steel at unsustainable prices and has exported materials at the marginal cost of production  according to Taccone 
Automotive demand may have peaked and aluminum demand may weaken steel demand 

Despite weak demand in some sectors  others paint a more positive picture  According to Alan Beaulieu  Principal of the Institute for Trends Research  many factors look more positive for demand including light vehicle production  U S  industrial machinery production  recently turned positive   a booming office building construction market  a stabilized oil and gas extraction market and healthy global demand for crude oil 

In addition  Beaulieu pointed to rising mining  electricity generation and manufacturing sectors  that certainly bodes well for power equipment production and demand 
Micro Trends
With the loss of Allegheny Technologies  NYSE ATI  capacity for GOES  the uptick in electricity generation and construction  and the more bullish outlook for other commodities and non ferrous metals  we might expect GOES prices to creep up accordingly 
Though the macro trends paint a slightly more negative picture for steel prices in general  negative for producers  positive for buying organizations  for the near term  GOES markets don t cleanly align with steel markets  September marks the second month of a rising price trend

104363,325878,ATI,Market Growth Doesn t Lead To Price Increases For GOES M3,opinion,"While domestic grain oriented electrical steel prices fell slightly this past month in the U S   the outlook for GOES globally looks bright 
According to a recently released study from Future Market Insights  the GOES segment of the market 6 should grow by 7 5  in value in 2016 and 7 3  to 2026 due to increased demand from the energy and power generation industries 

From a geographical perspective  North America  Europe and Japan all contribute to a strong market  however  the Asia Pacific region serves as the largest market by volume with China leading the charge 
Trade Cases
Despite the projected growth of GOES  many flat rolled steel products have become subject to one form of trade case or another  Despite the anti dumping duties imposed on China in the case of cold rolled coil and other countries for hot dipped galvanized  hot rolled coil and others  when an exporting country receives a punitive duty  the flow of material merely moves to other exporting nations not identified in the specific trade case 
Steel prices have been in a steady decline since the beginning of August  At best  trade cases provide a few months of pricing power for domestic producers 
Two years have passed since AK Steel  NYSE AKS  and Allegheny Technologies  NYSE ATI  brought their GOES trade petitions to the International Trade Commission  The ITC found the domestic producers  unharmed  by imports  The trade cases resulted in absolutely nothing for the domestic producers   ATI even shut down its GOES line  MetalMiner s M3 MMI index and actual spot market coil prices have declined since 2014

Commentary Financial markets are on Day  4 of post election trading and plenty of momentum remains in Trump related stocks  However  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   has largely missed out for the past 3 days  Since the rally on Day  1  the index has gone exactly nowhere  The tech laded NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   is DOWN slightly and on Monday closed below its 50 day moving average  DMA  again 

The S P 500  SPY  gained more going into the election than after  so far   The highs from September s consolidation stand as stiff resistance again 

The NASDAQ  QQQ  has found a brick wall at 50DMA resistance 
  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  is a handy reminder that the underlying fundamentals of the overall stock market remain strong  In other words  the market has hidden momentum  If the S P 500 traded just a little worse  I would label this hidden momentum as a bullish divergence  Instead  it is just plain bullish 

T2108 has made consistent  incremental progress since the first bullish post election reaction 
T2108 soared enough to end the downtrend that dogged my favorite technical indicator since July  The toppy action from February is still in place  but those were extremely extended and rare overbought conditions  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  is a better sign that the longer term view has not quite healed  T2107 has surged from around 48  to 61   but I would like to see it get above the post recession downtrend line  The good news here is that a rally to that level will lift a lot of boats higher 

The volatility index  the VIX  supports the bullish thesis by trading just under the 15 35 pivot  Yet  I am starting to eye warily the ability of the index to maintain slightly inclined support drawn from the August low 

The volatility index  the VIX  made a quick run above the 15 35 pivot line before closing for a 3 9  loss 
Financials delivered another strong push to the market s underlying momentum  I have yet to hop aboard because I want to buy a dip  This movement straight up like a rocket is truly awesome to behold  A buyable dip may end up consisting of just the reversal of one day s trading 

Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  has increased 11 1  post election   all nearly straight up 
Financials are benefiting indirectly from Trump  The accepted narrative is Trump s stimulus program of massive tax cuts and infrastructure spending is going to bring the inflation that has as yet eluded the entire industrialized world since the financial crisis  Fear of inflation is driving bond yields higher and increasing market expectations for Fed rate hikes  Higher rates allow financial institutions more profit margins as the spreads between short term  borrow  and long term  lend  rates widen   With bonds selling off so sharply  I am starting to wonder whether bond losses could also hurt these same financial institutions  
Players in the bond market are not waiting around for Trump s inauguration to confirm the narrative  With interest rates so low  too much is at stake  There are even fears that Trumps plans could   With the Republicans in full control of government  there will be little standing in the way of additional spending and deficits except the bond market itself  The bond sell off has been infectious with reportedly  

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  has nearly lost all its gains for 2016 
The U S  dollar index  DXY0  also continues to benefit from the post election Trump narrative  The soaring rates in the U S  are causing a larger spread with other bond markets and making the dollar relatively more attractive  So the prospect of ballooning government deficits does not concern the market for now even as these higher rates make government borrowing more and more expensive  The dollar index touched the magic 100 number briefly today for the first time in a year  As I promised in an earlier post  I have closed out part of my net dollar long position to lock in profits here 

Like financials  the U S  dollar index has soared nearly straight up since the election 
The higher yields and stronger dollar are really doing a number on precious metals  The SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  is on its fifth day of a 200DMA breakdown and is testing the low from May  The iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  finally followed suit on Friday with its own 200DMA breakdown 
The hesitation from SLV was probably related to the overall global rally in industrial commodities in anticipation of demand from a massive U S  infrastructure buildout  I could not resist this opportunity to speculate one more time on an eventual bounceback  I started buying December call options on Friday and added to them on Monday 
The call options expire right after the Federal Reserve s December rate decision so this position should at least be a great hedge against a Fed surprise   I remain baffled as to why so many pundits and even gold bugs assumed gold would soar post Trump  like some kind of pre apocalypse trade  I have never liked gold as a hedge against or play on fear  

The SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  broke down violently in the wake of Trump s victory 

The iShares Silver Trust  SLV  tried for 2 day to join the global rally in industrial commodities before cratering along with gold 
The rotation out of tech stock darlings continued in earnest  I tried to play Facebook  NASDAQ FB  on Friday as a darling that could hold 200DMA support  That support failed dramatically on the day  I am now standing down on these plays until the trading behavior firms up and looks at least less bearish 

Facebook  FB  broke down below its 200DMA support and stayed down 
The industrial sector must be sucking up a bunch of tech money  The anticipated industrial revival is sending skyward a vast array of related stocks  Two industrial stocks that I have my eye on are long favorites that I failed to buy back on the most recent sell offs  Allegheny Technologies Inc   NYSE ATI  is on the edge of a breakout and has 19 7  of its float sold short  The run up could actually accelerate on a breakout 
Timkensteel Corp  NYSE TMST  is still below book value and is on the verge of breaking out above its high for the year  Of course on both of these stocks I am trying to wait for some kind of cooling off period before making my plunge  But I am also willing to play a breakout  especially on ATI  on the assumption of the start of a new bullish phase 

Allegheny Technologies Inc   ATI  has gained 21  to trade right at the edge of a breakout for the year 

TimkenSteel Corporation  TMST  also gained 21  to trade at the edge of a breakout for the year 
In a  normal  world  both ATI and TMST would stop rallying right here and cool off simply from technical resistance  Buyers SHOULD take a breather at such natural stopping points to more coolly assess the market opportunities 
Yet  this post Trump world is far from normal financial markets are soaring on the prospect of a Republican President expanding U S  deficits  launching massive industrial projects  AND threatening to realign global trade deals more more in favor of the U S  This entire dynamic is thoroughly fascinating even if a lot of privatization underlies much of what is coming 
I acknowledge that the current narrative may carry the seeds of its own destruction  At some point  bond yields should get high enough to make stocks a lot less attractive in comparison  At some point  some of the subtle contradictions in the narrative may generate more doubts about the logic of the rally and cause a substantial pullback 
Yet  as I have argued earlier  these Presidential narratives have historically delivered very strong and sustained results  So  I am giving the current narrative a major benefit of the doubt for now

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks with Recent Broker Rating Upgrades to Buy Now 

The opinion of brokers acts as a valuable guide for investors in their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to immediately influence the price of the stock 

Sell side analysts  the most prevalent ones  are employed by brokerage firms to research on certain companies  They come up with information on various aspects of companies like their earnings performance  long term growth prospects etc  and accordingly give their recommendations  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  So  an analyst  irrespective of the type  does extensive research on the company s  followed 

Why Broker Ratings are Important

Broker ratings do not come from the blue and are backed by sound logic  In fact  they have a lot more information on a company and its prospects than normal people as they not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations 

Naturally  if investors see that brokers are improving their recommendations on a particular stock  they are more often than not inclined to believe that there is a catalyst behind it  For example  a company might have issued an improved earnings guidance based on some positive factors  This can well lead investors to follow brokers  opinion on the same 

Before putting their hard earned money into a stock  investors look at the earnings estimate revisions that serve as a guide to the direction of its price movement  Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario  For example  if oil prices touch extreme lows then it is good for airline stocks  This causes analysts to adopt a bullish stance on such stocks and raise estimates  On the other side of the spectrum  analysts trim estimates if something negative concerning the company happens  say a pipeline failure can lead to estimates moving south for a biotech player  which might drag down its price  

Making the Most of What Analysts Say

We have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has also been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line thereby making the strategy foolproof 

Screening Criteria

   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75    This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks  

  change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10    This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter  

We have also added the following screening parameters to ensure that the strategy is a winning one 

Price to Sales   Bot 10    The lower the ratio the better  companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio  

Price greater than 5    as a stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors  

Average Daily Volume greater than 100 000 shares over the last 20 trading days    Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded  

Market value    mil    Top  3000    This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization  

Com ADR Canadian  Com    This takes out the ADR or Canadian stocks  

Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen 

Big Lots  Inc       Based in Columbus  OH and founded in 1967  Big Lots is a broad line closeout retailer in the United States  The stock has an impressive track record with respect to earnings  having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  The average beat is 8 54

104456,325971,ATI,Will Domestic Stainless Steel Anti Dumping Lawsuits Create Market Havoc ,opinion,"If anti dumping lawsuits are filed  what will the impact be on manufacturers and buying organizations 
Why Are Imports Up 
Let s remember the reason imports began increasing in mid 2014  domestic mills had four month lead times  Service centers  as well as large manufacturers  had to source imported cold rolled stainless to stay in business 
A surplus of both domestic and imported cold rolled stainless has led to low prices 
Manufacturers also relied on imports to make up for the loss of production at Outokumpu s Calvert  Ala  plant caused by technical issues with its cold rolling mills  In addition to long lead times  the strengthening US dollar kept imports flowing to the US 
Right now  there is a glut of both domestic and imported cold rolled stainless steel  Service centers still have higher than desirable inventories 
Base price or Nickel Surcharge 
Is it really the base price that is hurting the domestic stainless mills  or is it the nickel surcharge that has declined by nearly 25  since the beginning of the year devaluing inventories  domestic and import alike 
That question may be tough to answer  so  instead  we ll look at the likely impact on buying organizations of anti dumping suits 

Bright Annealed Coil  Allegheny Ludlum  NYSE ATI  is the only US producer of 48 inch wide  bright annealed coil  AK Steel  NYSE AKS  is the only producer of 36 inch wide  Outokumpu s HEL OUT1V  Mexinox facility produces 48 inch wide  but is in Mexico  and could be subject to anti dumping duties  as it was in 1998  The bright annealed demand in the US exceeds the domestic supply  making imports a necessity  The bright annealed finish can vary greatly from producer to producer  so once reliable and consistent quality is established  buying organizations will want to stick with that source  Some of the best producers of bright annealed coil are in Taiwan  China and Japan  as well as France and Germany 
Light Gauge Coil   030  and thinner   Once the mills get busy again  the light gauges are going to become constrained  The thinner the thickness  the longer it takes to roll on a cold rolling mill  If anti dumping lawsuits are filed  then light gauge from domestic mills could become more expensive  thus increasing the cost to the manufacturer 
Proprietary Stainless Grades  Although the US stainless cold rolled market is dominated by 304  316L  301  201 and 430  there could be alloys strictly made on an import basis that would be part of anti dumping cases 

The domestic mills need to look at their strengths and capitalize on them  Anti dumping lawsuits are a crutch  not a cure  for domestic producers  In the end  stainless coil anti dumping suits hurt the manufacturer because it limits options and artificially increases prices to source stainless steel coil 
As seen in 2014  imports were a necessity for the US market and have always supplemented it  The domestic mills have already regained short lead times  They are back to delivering many products in under four weeks  The option to import cold rolled stainless steel needs to be left open in the event that domestic mills cannot fulfill US demand ",2015-07-20,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-domestic-stainless-steel-anti-dumping-lawsuits-create-market-havoc-258821,258821

104458,325973,ATI,ATI And USW Agreement Still Shrouded In Secrecy  Vote Coming,opinion,"As we reported yesterday  the The United Steelworkers union has reached a tentative four year agreement with Allegheny Technologies  Inc   after 2 200 workers were locked out more than six months ago 
ATI confirmed the agreement but said little else in a statement that read   Allegheny Technologies Incorporated  N ATI  confirmed today that it has reached a tentative agreement with the bargaining committee of the USW on a new contract covering over 2 000 employees at the company s Flat Rolled Products business and other locations  
Not Yet Approved
The specialty steelmaker also noted that voting on and ratification of the agreement could take two or more weeks  The lockout involved workers at 12 plants in 6 states  The agreement involve the union dropping a complaint before by the National Labor Relations Board  a USW spokesman  Pittsburgh Post Gazette 
The USW  however  was already claiming a  victory  for the locked out workers 
 This is a tremendous victory for a very brave group of workers  They should be proud of this agreement  and of the resolve they demonstrated throughout this six month ordeal   said USW International President Leo W  Gerard in a statement   They showed us all the strength that we can have when we stand together in unflinching solidarity  

ATI would like to get back to selling shipping stainless steel  Source Adobe Stock Jovanning 
Very little is known yet about the actual agreement other than its length  four years   USW VP Tom Conway  who was the union s top negotiator  said   It s a good agreement  I am confident they will ratify  and I think our folks are anxious to put their lives back together again  
Idled Operations
What will happen to operations that were idled during the lockout is also anyone s guess  270 Union workers at ATI s Midland  Pa   plant   which the company had continued to operate with management and temporary employees before idling it last month   stand to lose their jobs if the plant stays on the commodity stainless sidelines 
The company has said the facility could remain idled for months until it can turn an acceptable profit as commodity stainless prices have fallen below ATI s profitability threshold  ATI similarly announced plans to idle its Gilpin Township  Pa   GOES production facility in April  which had employed a similar number of union workers before it was staffed with replacements during the lockout  If ATI stays out of the GOES business then AK Steel  N AKS  will be the sole US producer of the important products used for electrical transmission 
ATI s  last  best and final offer to the USW  before the lockout  included    4 500 in lump sum payments over the four year agreement and continued incentive programs for ATI Flat Rolled Products employees  who averaged  94 000 in earnings in 2014  
The proposal also included what ATI characterized as  affordable solutions for continued family healthcare  at about half the cost that the average American worker pays  
The USW  at the time  did not agreed with ATI s average earnings calculation and did not support giving new hires different benefits than employees who are grandfathered in under previous agreements  another sticking point between the union and the steelmaker ",2016-02-24,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ati-and-usw-agreement-still-shrouded-in-secrecy,-vote-coming-200119327",200119327

104461,325976,ATI,5 Stocks With Recent Broker Rating Upgrades To Buy Now,opinion,"The opinion of brokers acts as a valuable guide for investors in their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to immediately influence the price of the stock Sell side analysts  the most prevalent ones  are employed by brokerage firms to research on certain companies  They come up with information on various aspects of companies like their earnings performance  long term growth prospects etc  and accordingly give their recommendations  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  So  an analyst  irrespective of the type  does extensive research on the company s  followed Why Broker Ratings are ImportantBroker ratings do not come from the blue and are backed by sound logic  In fact  they have a lot more information on a company and its prospects than normal people as they not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations Naturally  if investors see that brokers are improving their recommendations on a particular stock  they are more often than not inclined to believe that there is a catalyst behind it  For example  a company might have issued an improved earnings guidance based on some positive factors  This can well lead investors to follow brokers  opinion on the same Before putting their hard earned money into a stock  investors look at the earnings estimate revisions that serve as a guide to the direction of its price movement   Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario  For example  if oil prices touch extreme lows then it is good for airline stocks  This causes analysts to adopt a bullish stance on such stocks and raise estimates  On the other side of the spectrum  analysts trim estimates if something negative concerning the company happens  say a pipeline failure can lead to estimates moving south for a biotech player  which might drag down its price  Making the Most of What Analysts SayWe have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has also been included  The price sales ratio takes care of
