11  This compared to consensus expectations calling for a decline to 3 005 million   New Home Sales New construction home sales rose 2 3 percent in April to 454 000  This compared to sales of 444 000 in March and came in well ahead of consensus estimates calling for new home sales of 425 000 for April  Prices for new homes also rose sharply last month  recording a year over year gain of 14 9

Both Arbor and Circulate will be integrated into IdentityLink  LiveRamp s identity resolution tool for omnichannel marketing  The process is expected to be completed within the next five months ACXIOM CORP Price

   Why this Move 
LiveRamp s acquisition of the two online platforms will help the company to expand its omnichannel identity graph as well as widen its network  This will enable brands to look beyond Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Custom Audiences and Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL   owned Google Customer Match for their marketing requirements   
With mobile and online channels increasingly gaining popularity  having a wide reach is of utmost importance  The acquisitions thus seem aptly timed to fulfill that goal  Moreover  the LiverRamp platform will be able to deliver more value to its partners and clients 
How Will These Deals Help LiveRamp   Acxiom 
With the acquisitions of Arbor and Circulate  LiveRamp will position itself better to lock horns with Facebook and Google in terms of people based marketing  Additionally  an improvement of 20 30  is expected in mobile match rates and 10 20  in online match rates 
The Arbor and Circulate deals will not only help LiverRamp to further strengthen its leadership position in identity resolution but will also drive growth for the company and add value to Acxiom s shareholders  By fiscal 2017  Arbor and Circulate are estimated to contribute revenues to the tune of  5 million

5931,227446,KNMCY,INTERVIEW UPDATE 2 Square Enix enjoys robust year end sales,news,"  Year end demand healthy despite economy
   On track to hit annual operating profit forecast
   Likely to miss 2010 11 recurring profit target
  Adds details  background 
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Noriyuki Hirata
 TOKYO  Jan 15  Reuters    Japan s Square Enix Holdings Co Ltd
said it enjoyed robust holiday sales despite a slowing economy 
and the videogame maker expects its operating profit to be
roughly in line with its forecast for the year to March 
 The global downturn has prompted some consumers to give up
purchases of big ticket items such as cars and flat TVs  but the
game industry is relatively well shielded as people stay home and
turn to low budget entertainment 
  Demand has been generally brisk   Square Enix President
Yoichi Wada told Reuters in an interview on Thursday 
  The sluggish economy has not hurt us that much yet  
 Square Enix  known for such blockbuster titles as  Dragon
Quest  and  Final Fantasy   said last November its operating
profit was likely to dip 2 4 percent to 21 billion yen   236
million  this business year compared with the previous year 
 Analysts on average expect Square Enix to post an operating
profit of 27 4 billion yen  according to Reuters Estimates 
 The Tokyo based company plans to launch the latest
installment of its  Dragon Quest  game series on March 28 in
Japan for Nintendo Co Ltd s wildly popular DS handheld game gear 
giving itself a major sales and profitability boost 
 Square Enix also plans to launch the next version of  Final
Fantasy  in 2009 in Japan  further strengthening its product
lineup 
 Overseas launches of the latest  Final Fantasy  game will
come in the business year from April 2010 or later  Wada said 
 Square Enix will offer the latest version   Final Fantasy
XIII   for both Sony Corp s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Corp s
Xbox 360 in North America and Europe  and exclusively for the PS3
in Japan 
 Annual earnings at video game software makers vary
significantly depending on whether they launch popular titles in
the year 
 Square Enix has sold more than 47 million units of its Dragon
Quest games and more than 85 million units of Final Fantasy
titles 
 EYES ON M A
 In the longer term  Wada said the company now appears likely
to miss its recurring profit target of 50 billion yen for the
year ending in March 2011  given the global downturn and a firmer
yen  which eats into exporters  revenues when converted into the
Japanese currency 
  It s going to be tough     Just when we are trying to boost
our overseas sales  the yen is getting firmer   Wada said 
 Japanese videogame software makers including Square Enix and
rivals Konami Corp and Capcom Co Ltd will need to expand their
overseas presence as the population in Japan is shrinking as well
as ageing rapidly 
 He said  however  the company will continue working towards
that goal through various steps including business alliances with
other software makers 
 For the current business year to March  Square Enix forecast
a recurring profit of 20 billion yen 
 Wada said he was in talks with quite a few companies on
possible acquisitions  repeating his usual reply to M A
questions 
  Talks are going on with various companies at home as well as
abroad   he said  without elaborating 
 Square Enix last year offered to buy smaller Japanese rival
Tecmo in a deal worth at least about  100 million  but Tecmo
rejected the proposal and said it would instead merge with
another Japanese game developer  Koei Co Ltd 
 Shortly after Wada s comments  shares in Square Enix closed
down 1 4 percent at 2 540 yen  outperforming the Nikkei average 
which fell 4 9 percent 
   1 88 94 Yen

The Current State of Affairs
Microsoft s cloud platform Azure currently enjoys nearly 17  share of the cloud computing market in China  second only to Alibaba Group Holding Limited s   NYSE BABA   Alibaba Cloud  However  Microsoft believes that it can scale up its market share by making some strategic partnerships in the region 
We note that Microsoft introduced its business of cloud computing in China nearly two years ago  However  the company is gradually recognizing the importance of partnerships that cloud play a pivotal role in expanding its cloud business presence in the country 
Currently  Windows and Office remain Microsoft s main revenue growth drivers  However  amid declining PC sales worldwide  the revenue stream could get adversely affected  The need of the hour is to diversify into other emerging sectors and Microsoft is doing just that  
Cloud Scope
As per an IDC report  worldwide public cloud services spending is estimated to reach a whopping  195 billion by 2020 growing at a CAGR of 20 4   Given the huge growth prospects the segment offers  it s no surprise that Microsoft is trying its level best to expand in the aforementioned field MICROSOFT CORP Price

Thwarts Cryptocoin Malware Attack  Microsoft says its Windows Defender was able to save a significant number of attacks from a cryptocoin mining malware called Dofoil  The malware  once it has infected a user s machine  downloads other necessary components to help it mine cryptocoin using the system s resources  This greatly pressures the processor  generating a lot of heat that can cause it to fail  So Defender s ability to detect and thwart the first attempt impacting 80 000 machines is commendable 
But that isn t all  Because it can now tap into machine learning resources in Microsoft s cloud  the information can be transmitted to other machines  Microsoft says this enabled it to protect another 320 000 computers running Windows 7  8 1 and 10  73  of the 400 000 computers saved were in Russia  18  were in Turkey and 4  in Ukraine        
First Renewable Energy Deal in India  Microsoft has signed a renewable energy deal with Atria Power in the Karnataka state of India to power its new  585 000 square foot Bengaluru facility  The 3 megawatts of solar power it is purchasing will take care of 80  of the estimated energy requirements of the plant  which will be operational in June 
The deal will bring Microsoft s total global direct procurement in renewable energy projects to nearly 900 megawatts  The focus on renewable energy in India is in line with the Prime Minister s goal of generating 100 gigawatts of solar power by 2022 as India s contribution to slow down climate change  
IBM Lawsuit  IBM has settled a lawsuit with Lindsay Rae McIntyre  former HR VP at IBM before she was appointed chief diversity officer and vice president of leadership succession planning in 2015  IBM claimed that she was in possession of its diversity data  hiring plans and strategy  which if passed on to Microsoft  would be harmful for the company  It therefore asked the court to enforce a one year non compete agreement she had signed on the grounds that these were economically valuable  trade secrets  
U S  District Judge Vincent L  Briccetti issued a restraint order  temporarily preventing her from moving to Microsoft  In accordance with the settlement  she can take the new role as diversity chief at Microsoft in July
