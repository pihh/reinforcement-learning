200833,422349,TCOM,Week Ahead  Are Investors Losing Faith In The Equities Market ,opinion,"VIX falls to lowest in month but still high compared to 2017  earlier 2018 volatility
Investors selloff for second consecutive Friday  coincidence  or unwilling to commit 

Though US stocks fell on Friday with the Dow  S P 500  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 all finishing lower on a weekly basis the major indices climbed  for a second week  Fundamentally  on Friday technology shares were a drag on markets after earnings disappointed  Technically  it was the second week in which investors were not willing to commit over the course of the weekend  Could this be a sign investors are losing faith in the equities market 
The S P 500 Index dropped 0 92 percent on Friday  with most sectors in the red  Consumer Staples outperformed   0 58 percent   while Communication Services   2 05 percent  and Technology   1 73 percent  underperformed  On a weekly basis  the index climbed 2 13 percent  with Health Care gaining   4 13 percent  boosted by diminishing odds of Republicans successfully repealing healthcare after losing the House to Democrats along with some states passing ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act 
The Dow Jones outperformed  with a one day setback of  only  0 77 percent  The mega cap index gained 2 84 percent for the week 
The NASDAQ Composite fell 1 65 percent on Friday though it rose 0 68 percent for the week  Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS  plunged after results signaled a slowdown in smartphone demand 
The Russell 2000 underperformed Friday  falling 1 77 percent  Technically  it s the only major US index that is under the uptrend line since the previous correction early 2016  It is also the only one beneath the200 DMA and a Death Cross is about to take place  with the 50 DMA crossing below the 200 DMA  a signal considered bearish by trend following systems 

While the VIX climbed on Thursday and Friday  volatility fell for the second straight week to the lowest levels in about a month  Still  it remains above its full 2017 and most of 2018 levels 

Treasury yields edged lower after the Federal Reserve reiterated on Thursday that it continues to plan for  further gradual  rate increases  Technically the 10 year yield found resistance at the previous peak  3 250  hit a month ago  Should it continue to fall below 3 050  it would complete a double top 

The US dollar is a quarter of a percent away from beating the October 31 peak and again reaching the highest level since mid 2017  The pound weakened amid ongoing speculation over a potential Brexit deal  Emerging market stocks and currencies slid 

West Texas Intermediate crude capped a 10th straight loss  slipping to the lowest since March  Technically  the 50 DMA crossed below the 100 DMA  showing recent price weakness 
Investors are keenly focused on any signs the economic cycle is peaking  While lower oil prices seem mostly driven by a surge in supply  not a drop in demand  there are more worrisome signs coming out of China  Data from the world s second largest economy showed a softer PPI  weak automotive sales and a disappointing outlook from Ctrip Com International  NASDAQ CTRP   all of which helped reignite lingering concerns about the health of the Chinese economy 
Asian financial shares performed particularly poorly late last week  following news that Beijing plans to set quotas for banks to pump credit into private companies  The offshore yuan held relatively steady  falling a bit at the end of the week  though there was little sign of an end to the U S  China trade war in the wake of the midterm elections 
Overall  this past week the market continued its rebound from the October pullback  on positive corporate earnings releases  the culmination of midterm elections  and a positive assessment of the economy from the Federal Reserve  all of which provided some renewed optimism  Recent market swings are reflecting a greater preponderance of headwinds and tailwinds in the investment environment  might also be obscuring the underlying factors that are likely to guide the market over time 
So are investors losing faith in the market  That s hard to say at this juncture  but it is particularly glaring that even after two up weeks  on the final day of trading both this past week and the week previous  markets finished lower  indicating a lack of investor optimism 
Perhaps the third  upcoming week will provide the  charm   Should markets have a repeat performance again in the coming week rising overall but closing on the final day of trade in the red signs would be solidifying that there s shrinking faith in this aging bull

200834,422350,TCOM,Will Ctrip Com  CTRP  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Ctrip Com  NASDAQ CTRP   which belongs to the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This travel services company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 39 95  
For the last reported quarter  Ctrip Com came out with earnings of  0 42 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 33 per share  representing a surprise of 27 27   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 19 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 29 per share  delivering a surprise of 52 63  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ctrip Com lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ctrip Com has an Earnings ESP of  20  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-ctripcom-ctrp-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200386511,200386511

1Q Preview  Favorable Travel Backdrop with Potential Upside to Margins

Next Week s Outlook 
After a series of good weeks  markets are witnessing significant reverses  Investors were probably waiting for the rally to end before indulging in profit taking  This has been compounded by some negative economic data  Such reports were having little impact until Monday  but have become an import factor after Tuesday 
A series of economic reports are due next week which will indicate whether the economy has the ability to achieve its 7 5  growth target  Trade data is due first  followed by reports on inflation  industrial production  retail sales and fixed asset investment  If the majority of these are positive in nature  they could add strength to the markets in the weeks ahead ",2014-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-stock-roundup:-china-life-to-buy-tpg-stake-222043,222043
200947,422463,TCOM,Chinese Travelers Take The Lead In Global Tourism,opinion,"The current bull run in Chinese equities underscores the conundrum of China for investors  the Chinese stock market is still basically a creature of psychology  The  fundamentals  of the Chinese stock market are not those fundamentals that investors from the developed markets are used to considering    return on capital and cost of capital  revenue and earnings growth  and so on  The critical  fundamental  for Chinese stocks is the support of the government for stock markets  With that fundamental in place  Chinese markets remain a momentum trade    and not an investment 
So why think about  fundamentals  at all with regard to Chinese stocks and sectors of the Chinese economy  Simply because many of the Chinese government s reform efforts are aimed at more deeply opening Chinese stock markets to the outside world  so that global capital will flow in  China is eager  for example  for the yuan to be included in the global currency basket of the International Monetary Fund  so that foreign banks will demand yuan to hold  China is also eager for mainland stocks to be included in major global indices such as the MSCI World Index    because that inclusion would mean that ETFs and mutual funds around the world would be demanding Chinese stocks so they can track the index 
As this process of opening continues over the coming years  China will face some fundamental conflicts  having open currency and capital markets can be disruptive  and exposes an economy to the vicissitudes of international capital flows  These flows can be devastating during economic crises  China will struggle to balance the benefits of open capital markets against the economic control the central government will lose 
However  right now  the direction is clear  With anti corruption efforts vigorous and ongoing  and concerted efforts being made to gradually bring Chinese capital markets up to better standards of freedom and transparency  fundamentals will start to matter more as time goes by  Investors in China will begin to benefit more from the kind of fundamental research that can allow patient investors elsewhere to find superior returns from strong business  and sector level fundamentals 
Chinese Tourism    Big and Growing Faster
 From that perspective  we want to point out one particular sector of the Chinese economy that s experiencing strong growth fundamentals as China shifts from an industrial led to a consumer led economy  tourism    In 2012  Chinese tourists vaulted into first place globally in terms of spending  The growth of that spending is blisteringly fast  up 21 percent from 2012 to 2013 Americans  the next biggest spenders  managed a 3 2 percent growth in international tourism expenditures  Without Chinese growth  global international tourism spending would barely be showing any growth at all 

This large and rapid growth is causing some  cultural  hiccups  by some accounts  Chinese tourists are replacing Americans in the stereotypes of rude travelers  and government monitors are beginning to admonish Chinese travelers returning from abroad when they have been noticed being especially disruptive  But most Chinese newly able to travel abroad are of course polite and curious adventurers  increasingly eager to get off the beaten path and manage their travels themselves  This is the introduction of China s new middle class to the world 
Only five percent of Chinese citizens have passports  however  This means that not only will there be fuel for the growth of international tourism from China for many years to come  there will continue to be strong growth of tourism within China as Chinese become more affluent 
Investment implications  Burgeoning arrivals of international travelers from China will be a strong tailwind for the global tourism industry in coming years  Tourism within China will also be growing quickly    and may be an excellent way for investors to gain exposure to the rise of China s middle class consumers  As mainland capital markets continue to become more open and transparent  the growing tourist trend suggests to us that regional and bargain airlines  as well as airports and hotels  could be good picks in China in the mid term  For now  though  we prefer to express our belief in China s stock market momentum through broad based index funds and through select Hong Kong listed securities  Several Chinese travel related companies trade in the U S     Ctripcom International Ltd  NASDAQ CTRP  is the most well known  We do not own this stock  but might purchase it if the price falls into a buying range as a result of the current Chinese market correction ",2015-05-10,Monty Guild,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chinese-travelers-take-the-lead-in-global-tourism-251194,251194
