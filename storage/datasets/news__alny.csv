14357,235872,ALNY,Alnylam Gets Second Product Approval Amid Stiff Competition,opinion,We issued an updated report on Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   on Nov 28 It is a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics based on RNA interference  RNAi    In August 2018  the FDA approved Onpattro  patisiran  lipid complex injection  a first of its kind RNA interference  RNAi  therapeutic  for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin mediated  hATTR  amyloidosis in adults  Onpattro is the first and only FDA approved treatment for this indication  The uptake of the drug has been strong  with more than 600 patients worldwide on commercial Onpattro treatment since launch as of Sep 30  2019  The drug should drive revenues for the company as it will be an important treatment option for people suffering from this often fatal disease In November  the FDA approved givosiran injection for subcutaneous use for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria  AHP   The approval came three months before the PDUFA date of Feb 20  2020  Gvosiran injection will be marketed by the trade name of Givlaari  This is the second RNAi therapeutic from Alnylam approved by the FDA in the last sixteen months  Givlaari is expected to be available in the United States by the end of 2019  This approval should further boost sales for the company  The company plans to achieve regulatory approval from the European Medicines Agency  EMA  for Givlaari  givosiran  in early 2020 for the treatment of AHP  It also plans to execute on U S  and EU commercial launches throughout 2020 Shares of the company have soared 61 2  year to date compared with the  s growth of 5 2  Alnylam has an impressive pipeline One of the candidates is vutrisiran  ALN AAT02   which is the first investigational RNA interference  RNAi  therapeutic targeting AAT with Alnylam s enhanced stabilization chemistry plus  ESC   GalNAc conjugate technology   During the third quarter of 2019  the company continued enrollment in the HELIOS A phase III study on vutrisiran  ALN TTRsc02  for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy   It expects to complete enrollment in the study in early 2020 Earlier in the month  Alnylam initiated the HELIOS B phase III study of vutrisiran  The company plans to continue enrollment in the study throughout 2020 Alnylam advanced lumasiran  an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type I  PH1   The company expects to file a new drug application  NDA  and a marketing authorization application  MAA  with the FDA and the EMA  respectively  in early 2020  assuming positive results from the phase III ILLUMINATE A study  Alnylam is also evaluating inclisiran  formerly known as PCSK9si or ALN PCSsc   an investigational RNAi therapeutic  in phase II ORION studies for hypercholesterolemia  The company s partner  The Medicines Company   NASDAQ MDCO    reported new results for the drug while developing the treatment for hypercholesterolemia  The company intends to file an NDA shortly The successful development and subsequent approval of these candidates will be a huge boost for the company Alnylam has entered several collaboration deals for the development and commercialization of its broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutic candidates In April  the company and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ REGN   extended their collaboration agreement  Both companies will work together to discover  develop and commercialize new RNA interference  RNAi  therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing disease targets expressed in the eye and the central nervous system  in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver  The companies plan to advance programs directed to 30 targets  Other candidates also might be introduced into clinical development during the initial five year discovery period  which may extend However  Alnylam derives a substantial amount of revenues from partnerships with companies like Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY    Takeda and Monsanto  NYSE MON   among others  The company is heavily dependent on partnerships for its operations and pipeline development activities  Moreover  Alnylam is not the only company working on RNAi based therapeutics  Companies like Ionis  Sarepta Therapeutics and Roche Innovation Center are also involved in the development of RNA based drugs Alnylam currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price    Today

14358,235873,ALNY,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  GLD  CRSP  GBT  ALNY And ARKG,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  November 29  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  SPDR Gold ETF   TSXV GLD    CRISPR Therapeutics   NASDAQ CRSP    Global Blood Therapeutics   NASDAQ GBT    Alnylam   NASDAQ ALNY   and ARK Genomics ETF  Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Why Gold Is Headed to Zero    And What You Should Buy InsteadI m a gold bear  That means I don t think investors should be storing significant amounts of their savings in the barbarous relic  You can hear me opine at length on the reasons why in this podcast I did with Tracey Ryniec   Since that recording was published on September 4  the SPDR Gold ETF is down 6  and my favorite industry is up over 15   with some key stocks sporting gains of 50 75  I ll cover that explosive sector in a moment  right after I tell you what recent event has made me even more bearish on gold Astronomers have been studying a large metals rich asteroid named Psyche in the rocky belt between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars which could contain enough gold to make everyone on the planet a billionaire Psyche  discovered by the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on 17 March 1852 from Naples and named after the Greek mythological figure  is one of the ten most massive objects in the asteroid belt  At over 200 km in diameter  it contains a little less than 1  of the mass of the entire asteroid belt Most importantly to our discussion here  Psyche is thought to be the exposed iron core of a protoplanet  and is the most massive metallic M type asteroid  If you know anything about the molten metal core of Earth  you will not be surprised to imagine what Psyche could possess as astronomers have measured and estimated its density to be consistent with that of other metallic asteroids According to radar and other sophisticated observations  Psyche appears to have a surface that is 90  metallic and scientists think that these metals are mostly iron and nickel  And this is where the speculation arises that its potential abundance of dense metals could also consist of sizable amounts of gold and platinum One estimate is that Psyche  roughly the size of West Virginia  contains over  5 000 quadrillion   50 000 trillion  of gold at current prices near  1 500 What if a space based mining mission were set up on Psyche that could start bringing back tons of new gold That amount of new supply would certainly put a dent in gold prices  now wouldn t it Well don t worry gold investors because that s a long way off Oh wait    NASA just called and said  Hold my Krugerrand  Mission to Psyche in 2022  Gets There in 2026From NASA    Astronomers on Earth have studied 16 Psyche in visible and infrared wavelengths  as well as radar  which suggest Psyche is shaped somewhat like a potato  Observations indicate that its dimensions are 173 miles by 144 miles  by 117 miles  Those measurements are where I took my cue to compare Psyche s size to West Virginia at 24 000 square miles  173 x 144   24 900sm  Psyche takes about five Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun  but only about four hours to rotate on its axis and complete a Psyche  day   Since scientists wonder whether Psyche could be an exposed core of an early planet that lost its rocky outer layers due to a number of violent collisions billions of years ago  they are extremely curious to begin the first mission to investigate a world of metal rather than of rock and ice We cannot see or measure Earth s core directly and so this mission will offer a window into the violent history of collisions and accretion that created terrestrial planets More from NASA    This intriguing asteroid is now the primary target of the Psyche mission  Targeted to launch in August of 2022  the Psyche spacecraft would arrive at the asteroid in early 2026  following a Mars gravity assist in 2023  Over 21 months in orbit  the spacecraft will map and study 16 Psyche s properties using a multispectral imager  a gamma ray and neutron spectrometer  a magnetometer  and a radio instrument  for gravity measurement   The mission s goal is  among other things  to determine whether Psyche is indeed the core of a planet size object  Obviously  NASA s scientific mission has priorities that have nothing to do with finding and mining precious metals  But that doesn t mean commercial space explorers haven t been chomping at the booster rocket to set foot on some metals rich rocks  after asteroid ownership was made legal for US companies in 2015 But the only firm with any reasonable shot at participating in that future might be Elon Musk s SpaceX  and not just because the Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  founder is well funded and  bold   as we learned from the 2016 book by space exploration pioneer Peter Diamandis  In Bold  Diamandis profiled the extra planetary visions of Musk  Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos of Blue Origin  But Musk is the first to begin mastering a key technology essential for landing on outer space asteroids with his Falcon Heavy craft that can also return to Earth s atmosphere and land  Martin Elvis  an astronomer from the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics  spoke at the American Association for the Advancement of Science  AAAS  annual meeting in Austin  Texas in 2018 and told the audience that he believes Falcon Heavy has the potential to make asteroid mining a significant commercial reality by increasing the number of asteroids that could be landed on by an order of magnitude According to Ryan F  Mandelbaum writing for Gizmodo in 2018  Elvis said of Musk s rocket technology  Instead of a few hundred  we may have thousands of ore bearing asteroids available  We may not see the first ounce of gold from outer space for another 10 years or more  But when we do  it could be cataclysmic for the price of the yellow metal The Journey to AlnylamNow let s talk about the industry that will create more millionaires than gold in the next decade  If you remember the podcast with Tracey in September  or you made an excellent guess  you might know that I m talking about Biotechnology Since that chat  where I discussed some of my special reports like The Century of Biology  one of my favorite investments CRISPR Therapeutics is up 50   And my Healthcare Innovators portfolio has an 80  gain as we adjusted our cost basis even more favorably during the October dip under  40 And even the more diversified  and thus more conservative  ETFs  baskets of stocks  for the industry group are up over 15   like the Nasdaq Biotech Index and the equal weighted S P Biotech ETF That s because CRSP wasn t the only thing moving in Biotech  We also saw Global Blood Therapeutics launch over 30  after receiving FDA accelerated approval for their treatment for sickle cell disease And then there s Alnylam  up 45  since mid October after receiving its second FDA approval to treat a rare genetic disease using RNA interference therapies I first identified ALNY as a promising Biotech investment in 2013 when it was trading under  30  It has quadrupled since then to nearly  120 and so I m very glad I put my Healthcare Innovators members back in the stock at  80 last month ALNY is named after Alnilam  a large blue supergiant star some 2 000 light years distant in the constellation of Orion  It is estimated to be 275 000 to 832 000 times as luminous as the Sun  and 30 64 5 times as massive We won t be traveling there any time soon  But in the time it takes the NASA mission to land on Psyche  ALNY shares could quadruple again You won t get that from gold in the next 7 years This is an exquisite coincidence for me as a gold bear who thinks it should be worth less than  500 an ounce    while I also believe that Alnylam could at least triple in a longer journey to 2026 by virtue of its leading platform R D in RNAi The Genomic Revolution Whenever I talk about  the century of biology  or the prospects for genetic and cell therapies  I tell people they should be excited to be living right in the middle of this revolution Even if you don t have capital available to invest or time to research the companies  the research and discoveries being made are world changing  There will be ethical challenges with gene editing and the costs associated with advanced therapies But there will also always be wonder to behold on the bleeding edges of science And so one plea I also make to new Biotech investors is the one I made recently on an episode of The Paper Traders podcast    In that chat I made the case very strongly that every investor should at least buy a Biotech ETF like IBB  XBI  or the ARK Genomics ETF  This accomplishes at least two things  first  you are invested in the industry with very low risk  and second  you expose yourself to learning about the top ten companies within the ETFs Or I should say  I at least hope you become curious about them Because becoming more curious about science and technology is never a bad thing And it may actually become a necessary thing in the next few decades  I know this is a wild idea to most because the presidential candidate who intrigues me most  is among those least likely to win as too few citizens care about his ideas or vision  Andrew Yang Yang really understands the power of technology like AI  automation and even Biotech that are about to drastically change the world  He also knows that education is the most important institution we need to be reinventing to help people respond creatively to these unstoppable revolutions  To understand why I think he has greater vision than any other candidate  see these 2 podcasts articles   You may not agree with Yang s Freedom Dividend  a proposal along the lines of Universal Basic Income   where every citizen would receive a monthly check for  1 000 But after you listen to my podcasts and read my articles above about what is coming with AI and other advanced technologies that the rich and powerful will control  you might pay more attention to what he is saying Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for

14359,235874,ALNY,Trade Of The 2020 s  Sell Gold  Buy Biotech,opinion," 0 45    The Behavior of Gold Investors 4 35    The Technology Super Cycle 7 45    The 4 Core Arguments Against Gold 12 30    NASA Mission To Psyche  The Fort Knox of Asteroids 22 50    Trade of the 2020 s  Sell Gold  Buy BiotechWelcome back to Mind Over Money  I m Kevin Cook  your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics 
In the fall of 2009  I went on CNBC for an interview about gold with anchor Maria Bartiromo  The yellow metal had just gotten back above the  1 000 level and was making new highs since the financial crisis 
My primary theme was to address the reality of gold doubling to  2 000 and higher if it was truly viewed as a monetary phenomenon 
In other words  since central banks were engaged in long term support of their economies and bond markets with measures like quantitative easing  QE   their balance sheet expansion was in effect like printing money and therefore the value of gold should go up in relation to that expanded supply of dollars  euros  and yen 
My thesis was not a precise mathematical calculation  According to  gold bugs  like Jim Rickards and Peter Schiff  the real math should send gold above  4 000 
So my idea was not based on what price gold should ascend to  but rather what price could be achieved because enough others believed it should vastly appreciate due to central bank QE and the coming tsunami of asset inflation 
The Behavior of Gold Investors
For me  it was simply a behavioral bet about what an asset bubble could achieve when a perfect storm of QE and true believers collided  It would also help if global money managers at large institutions were advising their wealthy clients and pension funds to invest in gold as a  safe haven  asset to protect against the vagaries of competitive currency devaluations 
The true believers were all over financial TV and advertising telling average folks that they needed to buy a  hard currency  like gold to preserve their wealth  In essence  turning dollars into gold was the safe bet because the former was certain to lose value over time to the benefit of the latter 
Sure enough  gold soared for nearly two years until the mania peaked just above  1 900 in the summer of 2011 
Unfortunately  I didn t make any money off of that trade because I didn t have enough faith in the idea  I was too scared of the volatility in such a euphoria driven asset class 
And  at heart  I really didn t believe gold was worth  2 000 an ounce  After all  I had just finished a ten year stint as a currency trader at the old Chicago Mercantile Exchange  now CME Group   NASDAQ CME    and in that role I had internalized the financial revolution that Milton Friedman launched when he helped CME create currency futures in 1971 after President Nixon abolished the gold standard 
Gold became effectively de linked from the financial system and there was no going back  Especially once central banks proved they could defend the global economy from collapse using fiat currencies  Debt  good or bad  was the lubrication for modern economies 
But there was another theme that was even more important than the mechanics of finance  technological innovation 
The Technology Super Cycle
I d been an eager student of how technology and innovation changed history and civilizations for millennia  But nothing hit me harder than holding my first Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  iPhone in my hand in 2010 
 How and why   I wondered   should a piece of metal be worth more than this magical device in my hand that could do so much for me  
And the more I expanded my knowledge of and investing in companies creating advanced technologies like computer chips and biotechnology cures  the more I became convinced of what John Maynard Keynes concluded nearly a century ago  gold was simply an obsolete antiquity  a  barbarous relic  
Soon I was convinced I could trade gold    but as a gold bear  shorting the yellow relic using inverse ETFs 
And gold went down from above  1800 to under  1200 from 2012 to 2015 
I thought it might keep going under  1 000 soon  but in 2016  central banks had to restart their QE money printing engines and gold put up a good fight to spend most of its time above  1 200 
Fine with me  I was so immersed in studying semiconductor companies like NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   and biotech companies like CRISPR Therapeutics   NASDAQ CRSP   that I didn t care what investors did with gold 
And in 2017  I summed up my ideas in special report for Zacks Confidential   

In that report  I was trying to answer two burning questions I had about the economy that I knew were related to technology and innovation 
1  Why was government productivity data so muted in a world of hyper speed technological efficiency and disruption 
2  Why was inflation so tame when stock market capitalization and investor wealth were soaring 
I dealt with both questions by searching for simple  convincing data and reliable economic sources  Once I found those answers about  weak  productivity and  missing  inflation  I used them to support my personal theory that we were in the midst of a Tech Super Cycle  driven by areas like advanced  big data  and mobile computing  Artificial Intelligence  networks and sensors  IoT   and Biotechnology

My 4 Point Argument Against Owning Gold
My core fundamental argument against gold is that it has little fundamental value  Other than the jewelry business  it generates no earnings or income  In fact  there is a net cost to own and store gold that should bring into question old ideas about it being a  store of value  
So if it has only minimal industrial utility  a little more jewelry value  and then there is some nebulous part of gold s value that is still related to its old  antiquated role of money since central banks are printing so much  what s the rest of its value all about 
It s all about psychology  about the true believers who want to have a hedge against the monolithic banking system and its corrupt bureaucrats  In the end  when fiat economics collapse  the little guy with his basement full of gold bars will triumph  Or so goes the prophecy 
I recently reviewed my anti gold thesis as a guest on the MarketEdge podcast with Tracey Ryniec   

I ll quickly summarize those 4 points here  but that podcast is free to listen to anytime 
1  Fiat central banking is here to stay  We are not going back to a gold standard  ever  And the rise of PayPal  Square  NYSE SQ  and Bitcoin confirm the primacy of the digital economy 
2  Technology drives economics and wealth creation  Innovation will always trounce a heavy metal bar that costs roughly  750 an ounce to produce  offers little utility and produces net costs for storage and insurance  even in a world of low interest rates  
3  Inflation is best beaten by investing in equities  especially a broad mix of innovative companies creating long tail revenue streams in technology and healthcare 
4  The global market has spoken  If all of the above were not true  why isn t gold back to new highs already  The market story of the past decade in gold is telling you that investors created a bubble that popped and that even extremely low or negative interest rates cannot reflate the bubble 
Gold is Going Down  And This is Going Up 
Last week I wrote an article with a very provocative title after a completely new development shocked me enough add a  5 reason not to buy the barbarous relic   

In the podcast    at minute 12 30  NASA Mission To Psyche  The Fort Knox of Asteroids     I share some key excerpts from that article that explain why it s not unreasonable to expect that the price of gold could be a lot lower in 10 years 
I also reveal another Biotech company I ve made 50  stock gains on in the past month  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ ALNY    a leader in RNA interference therapies with their second FDA approval last month to treat a rare disease 
In closing  I ll share the story from another TV appearance in 2009  This time it was in the first week of March  when the stock market was collapsing to levels not seen in over a decade 
It was actually my first time on financial TV and the producers at FOX Business expected me to bring stock recommendations 
But the market was still in free fall and I didn t want to pick any stocks  for anyone  when they could easily be down another 10 20  in a week 
We had just seen Warren Buffett himself stepping up to buy banks like Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  in the autumn of 2008  and then watching those shares fall another 50  as visions of economic collapse overwhelmed investors and capital markets 
So I decided to offer the next best and safest route  ETFs  Because I believed the one thing I could almost guarantee would be an excellent long term buying opportunity in two key sectors of the market  Technology SelectSector SPDR ETF  and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ETF  
Both ETFs were  no brainers  for any investor with a 5 10 year horizon to grow their money  And because they both held a basket of the top stocks in their sector industry  there was little company specific risk 
Both ETFs have vaulted nearly 500  during this bull market  beating the stock averages by a considerable margin 
Of course  they both clobbered gold too with its mild 100  advance from the October 2008 lows near  700 
And I am predicting this trend will continue into the 2020 s 
The Real Gold You ll Want to Mine for the Next Decade
After you read my article   you may conclude that gold could actually still make new highs by 2025 if we get another behavioral bubble  I m certainly not ruling out that possibility because the event that will cause it to go below  1 000 is still ten years away  with lots of expense and uncertainty around it  subject to the constraints of outer space travel and mining 
So you don t have to sell your gold now  In fact  you should wait at least 5 years  I ll be updating my thesis long before then 
But what you absolutely must do now  and over the next few years  is to invest in Biotech and Technologystocks and ETFs 
There s more  gold  to harvest in those two growth destinations over the next decade than any asteroid mining could offer to your future wealth 
Indeed  the real money to made off of asteroids will be in the technology and medicine that support space explorers and  miners  accomplishing their missions

14360,235875,ALNY,Pfizer Gets CHMP Nod For Vyndaqel Label Expansion In Europe,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   announced that the European Medicines Agency s  EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has rendered a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for label expansion of Vyndaqel  tafamidis  
The company is seeking approval of once daily Vyndaqel  61 mg  for the treatment of wild type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with cardiomyopathy  ATTR CM   a rare and fatal illness associated with progressive heart failure 
The CHMP s opinion will be now reviewed by the European Commission with decision expected in the coming months  If approved  Vyndaqel will become the first pharmacologic therapy to address the given patient population in Europe 
Currently  there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for patients with ATTR CM  Per the press release  people suffering the disease are diagnosed with life expectancy averaging two to three and half years from diagnosis 
The positive CHMP opinion was based on data from the completed phase III study ATTR ACT  which evaluated oral daily dose of 61 mg Vyndaqel versus placebo in patients with wild type or hereditary ATTR CM 
Data from the study showed that treatment with Vyndaqel led to a significant reduction in the combination of all cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular related hospitalizations   the primary endpoint   compared to placebo at 30 months  Moreover  treatment with Vyndaqel led to a 30  reduction in the risk of mortality and 32  lower rate of cardiovascular related hospitalization as compared to placebo 
Shares of Pfizer have decreased 12 2  so far this year against the  increase of 8 9  

Vyndaqel is already marketed in Europe for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy  ATTR PN  in adult patients with stage I symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment 
In May 2019  Vyndaqel and Vyndamax  two oral formulations of tafamidis  were approved in the United States to treat transthyretin cardiomyopathy  TTR CM   The drug recorded sales of  156 million in the third quarter of 2019 
We remind investors that Alnylam Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ ALNY   Onpattro  patisiran  is already approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin mediated  hATTR  amyloidosis in adults  The entity is also looking to expand the label of Onpattro into cardiomyopathy  Upon potential approval  this can induce competition for Vyndaqel

109756,331271,ALNY,Why Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Rose 57 9  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALNY  jumped 57 9  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  That far exceeded the 28 8  gain of the S P 500 in 2019  though all of the pharma stock s gains came in the fourth quarter  
It was quite the finish considering that the stock got off to a rocky start  collapsing in May after first quarter 2019 operating results were released  At the time  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals also announced plans to increase research and development spending  which made investors nervous  Could the money losing business justify that decision with only one drug on the market  Those concerns were short lived  however  as the company exited the year with two approved drug products  and one or two more headed toward approval in 2020 

So what
In August 2018  the U S  Food and Drug Administration approved Onpattro  patisiran  to treat a rare disease called transthyretin amyloidosis  hATTR   It was the first drug candidate based on RNA interference  RNAi   a gene silencing technique that can be used to reduce the impact of disease driving genes  to earn regulatory approval  
While Onpattro product sales more than doubled from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019  investors balked when Alnylam Pharmaceuticals proposed increasing its R D spend from  540 million to  570 million for the year  After all  the business reported an operating loss of  189 million in Q1 
Shares bottomed out in May and June  but began inching higher over the next five months  Then  on Nov  20  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals announced the surprise approval of Givlaari  givosiran  as a treatment for adults with the rare disease acute hepatic porphyria  AHP   The FDA made a decision only four months after the company submitted its new drug application  NDA  for Givlaari  The process usually takes six to 10 months or longer 
Givlaari is expected to eventually capture most of the  500 million market opportunity for AHP  It s also the first RNAi drug to utilize a targeted delivery technology to earn regulatory approval  which bodes well for the company s and industry s deep pipeline of therapies utilizing that model  
Now what
Investors have reason to be optimistic that Alnylam Pharmaceuticals will maintain its momentum in 2020  It ended the year by announcing positive results from a phase 3 clinical trial of Lumasiran as a treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type 1  PH1   The drug candidate met its primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints  providing it with a strong case for regulatory approval  The company plans to submit applications in the United States and European Union in early 2020  
It will take time for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals to ramp up its product sales and start to erase its operating losses  but the company appears to be on a solid trajectory that would make it a good investment for those with a long term mindset ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfy4x,2056011

109791,331306,ALNY,With Hemlibra  Roche seeks to break into tight hemophilia circle,news,By John Miller ZURICH  Reuters    Swiss drugmaker Roche  S ROG  is breaking into hemophilia A treatment  a  10 billion global market dominated by rivals who have cultivated close ties to sufferers of the genetic bleeding disorder  Roche s Hemlibra  on sale since late 2017 for patients with resistance to existing treatments  is widely expected to win the U S  Food and Drug Administration s blessing for use in nearly all patients this week  The FDA declined to comment  First half sales were just 57 million Swiss francs   58 million   To hit  5 billion global annual sales that some analysts forecast  Hemlibra must wrest business away from hemophilia giants like  Shire   L SHP   Bayer  DE BAYGn    Novo Nordisk   CO NOVOb  and Octapharma  whose  clotting factors  are now standard for people who lack proteins that stop bleeding  These companies have long sponsored patient groups  summer camps  even kayak trips on the Pacific Ocean  as part of efforts to build loyalty they hope will slow an exodus from their products once new drugs like Roche s arrive  Roche is convinced word of mouth in the hemophilia community  backed up by its studies showing that Hemlibra shots may be more effective and must be administered less frequently than infusions of clotting factors  will overcome any current allegiances   I m not familiar with what the other companies are telling the patients   said Dr  Gallia Levy  who heads Roche s Hemlibra program   What I do know is that I ve seen a lot of patients telling other patients what is happening in their lives  Those sorts of stories mean the most to the patients   As part of Roche s initial marketing campaign for Hemlibra  it has produced videos of hemophilia patients participating in daily activities  including riding bikes  in spite of their serious illness  One video shows the consequences of failing to get appropriate treatment  featuring a Serbian man who suffered joint bleeds as a child and now must use crutches  Hemophilia A has become one of medicine s most lucrative diseases  despite just 20 000 patients in the United States and several hundred thousand worldwide  It almost always affects men  passed down by a mutation on the X chromosome from their mother   In 2016  the U S  government alone spent some  2 billion on hemophilia A therapies  data from its Medicaid and Medicare insurance programs show   Shire s Adynovate clotting factor runs at  537 000 annually  although costs for severe patients can hit several million dollars   Roche has priced Hemlibra at  482 000  hefty but a level the independent U S  pricing group ICER has said could cut overall hemophilia treatment costs significantly  Traditionally a cancer drugs maker  Roche is turning to rare diseases like hemophilia to replace revenue from its older medicines whose expiring patents have exposed the company to unprecedented generic competition  Hemophilia represents the largest market for rare diseases and is expected to grow above 7 percent per year through 2022  Evaluate Pharma has forecast   RELUCTANT TO SWITCH  In August  Roche defeated a challenge from Shire aimed at delaying Hemlibra s broad introduction   Shire fears losing 30 percent of its  2 4 billion annual clotting factors sales to Hemlibra in the short term  court documents show  However  it also indicated it expected patient allegiances to at least mitigate losses   Patients have loyalty to the brand and to manufacturers  and physicians are reluctant to switch due to risks   according to Shire testimony cited in the U S  federal court judge s ruling  Clotting factor makers have fostered this loyalty  in part  by sponsoring summer camps for patients and their families  Camp Red Sunrise in Idaho s Rocky Mountains  sponsored by Shire and Bayer  among others  is free  Another Shire sponsored retreat  Missouri s Camp Notaclotamongus  costs  25  In September  Switzerland based Octapharma sponsored a free sea kayaking expedition for 10 hemophilia patients on Washington State s Puget Sound  offering a chance to see pods of orca killer whales  Shire  Bayer and Octapharma did not respond to requests for comment on their efforts to boost ties to patients  Adriane Fugh Berman  a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington  runs PharmedOut  a project that scrutinizes the influence the drug industry has on the practice of medicine   A 2016 paper she co authored described hemophilia s corporate patient links and how companies use gifts  financial opportunities and one on one marketing to advance their commercial interests   Hemophilia is unique  Fugh Berman said  since patients play a bigger role in their treatment decisions than elsewhere in medicine where doctors more often call the shots   Industry s relationship with individual patients or health care providers is always about selling specific targeted products   Fugh Berman told Reuters  adding tight corporate links to patients could hamper discussion including over drug prices  even among patient groups with the best of intentions   Taking money from industry prevents them from asking hard questions   she said   The National Hemophilia Foundation  NHF   like nearly all hemophilia patient groups  gets money from companies including Roche to pay for education  research and programs  But a spokesman said the group had strict rules that forbid advocating for a given product   We are focused on ensuring patients receive access to the treatment that their physician determines to be the most appropriate   he said by email   Michelle Rice  the NHF s head of external affairs and the mother of a hemophilia patient  said convincing everyone in the hemophilia community to quickly switch therapies will be difficult  despite benefits promised by new drugs  That is in part because of the disease s tragic history  Many hemophilia patients died after acquiring HIV and hepatitis through tainted blood products in the 1980s   We lost about 10 000 people in our community   Rice said   They re not inclined to just jump to the next bright shiny thing  unless they see a real potential advantage   When her son was born 28 years ago  Rice said  there were just a handful of therapies available   Now  there are some two dozen approved products  with more in the pipeline as hemophilia s potentially rich returns lure companies to pursue new approaches  France s Sanofi  PA SASY   which this year bought Biogen s  O BIIB  hemophilia business  is working with U S  based Alnylam  O ALNY   Novo Nordisk has an alternative to clotting factors in the works  too   And experimental one time gene therapies now being tested by BioMarin  O BMRN   Spark Therapeutics  O ONCE  and Sangamo  O SGMO  would be very expensive  but could end indefinite infusions or injections  This could threaten reliable cash flows for clotting factor makers as well as pose a challenge to Hemlibra  Despite existing relationships between patients and companies  Spark s Chief Operating Officer John Furey said scientific and financial arguments should win the day  If gene therapy helps patients and reduces overall costs for insurers  Furey said   we ll be able to persuade the community this is a very good option for them

109889,331404,ALNY,These 3 Healthcare Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2020  Says Cowen,opinion,The calendar might have flipped to 2020  but that doesn t mean everything has changed  Investors are still scouring the Street in search of the most compelling investment opportunities  the names that could see 2020 be their year These aren t just any run of the mill stocks  We re talking about tickers that are set to outperform the broader market and can hand over substantial returns in the year ahead  Having said that  tackling this job isn t always easy  With so many options out there  it can seem overwhelming  Luckily  Wall Street analysts are here to lend a hand Often experts in the industries that they cover  a nod of approval from the Street s seasoned pros can signal that a certain stock should be on investors  radar  Bearing this in mind  we turned to the analysts at investing firm Cowen for some inspiration as we started our own search  Using TipRanks  which assembles a comprehensive database of stock performance information  we were able to take a closer look at 3 of the firm s top picks for 2020  To top it off  each has the support of the rest of the Street as well  boasting a  Strong Buy  consensus rating Alexion Pharmaceuticals  ALXN Alexion is best known for developing innovative therapies to improve the lives of patients battling rare diseases  While the company stumbled a bit in 2019 as a result of concerns about competition from biosimilars  Cowen thinks that 2020 could see a major turnaround for the company Analyst Phil Nadeau tells investors that the market has been  overly harsh  about ALXN s potential  noting that the shift from its Soliris drug to Ultomiris should bode well for the company   Our DCF analysis suggests that the current stock price assumes that worldwide sales of ALXN s C5 franchise in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS  and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  in 2024 and after are 75  below our current projections  We think that this is an overly pessimistic view of its sustainability  Based on Ultomiris  benefits over Soliris we think that ALXN s franchise is far more defensible than most investors

RNA interference  RNAi   Alnylam is changing the way debilitating diseases are treated  Based on the Nobel Prize winning science  the company offers five late stage programs that could address the large unmet need  Even with shares up 58  in the last year  Cowen s Ritu Baral believes even more gains are in store The analyst cites ALNY s patented GalNAc construct science as well as its clinical strategy as helping it become a  dominant  player in the space  Its ONPATTRO  patisiran  drug for hATTR familial amyloid polyneuropathy  FAP  has already impressed with its performance and has seen consistent growth since its initial launch  In its third quarter  sales came in at  46 1 million  up 21  quarter over quarter with 600 patients currently using the therapy  Part of this success is thanks to its partnerships with 23andMe and genetic testing through the Alnylam Act Program  which has increased physician education  disease awareness and helped improve diagnostic methodology The good news doesn t stop there in Baral s opinion   The company is further de risked by its late stage compounds including just launched GIVLAARI  inclisiran  and lumasiran that should significantly increase recurrent revenues within the next 24 months and drive top line growth  This is coupled with multiple early stage programs  most wholly owned  some partnered  in both orphan disorders and more prevalent diseases which should yield multiple catalysts in the same time frame   the five star analyst commented Baral argues that the company is transitioning to a  self sustainable large cap biotechnology   with this potentially attracting a broader group of investors  It s no wonder  then  that the analyst boosted the price target from  120 to  154 in addition to maintaining the

Preclinical data have shown that the combination of a KRAS G12C inhibitor with a SHP2 inhibitor results in increased anti tumor activity based on their complementary mechanisms of action  Per the company  the combination of MRTX849 and a SHP2 inhibitor in its non clinical studies demonstrated a clear impact on KRAS signaling  and resulted in a significant increase in anti tumor activity in some tumors versus either of the investigational drug alone 
Mirati believes that the collaboration will broaden its KRAS program by potentially increasing the efficacy of MRTX849 and bringing another option to patients with KRAS G12C mutations  who have conventionally exhibited resistance with other therapies 
Another company  Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   has a candidate  AMG 510  which targets the KRAS G12C mutation  In June 2019  the company announced encouraging early data from a study evaluating AMG 510 at the annual meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO   Mirati s shares were up almost 32  after Amgen s promising initial data on its KRAS G12C inhibitor Mirati Therapeutics  Inc  Price

In the last reported quarter  the company beat earnings expectations by 20 2   The company s track record is excellent  In the last four quarters  the company surpassed earnings estimates by an average of 13 1   Let s see how things are shaping up for the to be reported quarter Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

    
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Regeneron s key growth driver  Eylea  continues to maintain momentum and should boost growth in the first quarter  Eylea  developed in collaboration with Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY    is approved in the United States  the EU  Japan and other countries for the treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration  wet AMD   diabetic macular edema  DME   and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion  which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion 
Meanwhile  Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea s label into additional indications  which should further boost sales   In August 2018  the FDA approved a 12 week dosing interval of Eylea injection in patients with wet age related macular degeneration  wet AMD  based on physician s assessment  The FDA also accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  of Eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy  with a target action date of May 13  2019 
Apart from Eylea s performance and label expansion efforts  investors will be focussing on the uptake of Dupixent and its label expansion efforts 
Strong Dupixent sales drove Regeneron s impressive sales in 2018 and we expect the momentum to continue in the first quarter as well  The uptake of the drug has been strong after it obtained approval last year for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD   The company and partner Sanofi  PA SASY  are also working to expand Dupixent s label  which should diversify the company s revenue base and reduce dependence on the lead drug 
Dupixent was approved for the treatment of adolescent patients aged 12 17 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in March 2019  The European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has given a positive opinion for Dupixent  dupilumab  for the indication of asthma 
Kevzara  an anti interleukin  IL  6 receptor monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  was approved by the FDA in May 2017  The uptake of the drug has been encouraging so far  Investors will focus on Kevzara s sales as well in the upcoming quarterly results 
Apart from these drugs  investors will also focus on the performance of PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent and Libtayo  Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced a 60  cut in the U S  list price of Praluent in February 2019  This should boost sales in the first quarter 
Moreover  the European Commission  EC  has approved a label expansion of Praluentto to reduce cardiovascular  CV  risk in adults with established atherosclerotic CV disease  ASCVD  by lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol  LDL C  levels as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors 
Investors are also expected to await updates on the company s pipeline  which includes its collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY

In August 2018  the company s lead drug  Onpattro  patisiran  received regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin mediated  hATTR  amyloidosis in adults  Onpattro is the first and only FDA approved treatment for this indication  Sales of the drug initiated on a strong note  with more than 200 patients in the United States and EU on commercial Onpattro treatment during the fourth quarter of 2018  The drug is expected to further boost sales of the company in 2019 
Alnylam is also planning to expand the label of Onpattro  In this regard  the company obtained regulatory alignment with the FDA on the design of its phase III study  which will evaluate Onpattro in hereditary and wild type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy  The study is expected to start mid 2019  The drug is also under review in Japan  Canada and Switzerland 
The company also has several other promising candidates in its pipeline 
Vutrisiran  ALN AAT02  is the first investigational RNAi therapeutic  targeting AAT with Alnylam s enhanced stabilization chemistry plus  ESC   GalNAc conjugate technology  However  the safety and efficacy of ALN AAT02 are yet to be evaluated by any health authority like the FDA or the EMA  The company initiated HELIOS A phase III study in hereditary ATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy  Late 2019  Alnylam plans to initiate an additional phase III study  HELIOS B  on vutrisiran in hereditary and wild type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy 
The company is advancing givosiran  an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria  AHP   It initiated rolling submission of a new drug application  NDA  in 2018 with plans to pursue full approval based on complete results from the ENVISION phase III study  Alnylam plans to complete the rolling submission of the NDA and file a Marketing Authorization Application  MAA  mid 2019 
Alnylam along with The Medicine Company   NASDAQ MDCO   is evaluating inclisiran in phase III ORION studies for hypercholesterolemia  The company expects to file an NDA in the United States at or around 2019 end  assuming positive phase III results 
Alnylam s expertise in RNAi therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate have allowed the company to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies like Ionis Pharmaceuticals  Novartis   NYSE NVS    Roche   OTC RHHBY    Takeda  Merck  Monsanto  NYSE MON   The Medicines Company and Sanofi s specialty care global business unit  Genzyme  among others  The companies collaborated to optimize the development and commercialization of certain products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases  Alnylam generates revenues from research collaborations  grants and licensing of the RNAi technology outside its core focus area 
These factors should further drive the share price of the company in 2019 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price

110080,331595,ALNY,Regeneron  REGN  To Report Q3 Earnings  Is A Beat In Store ,opinion,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   is scheduled to release third quarter 2018 results on Nov 6  before the opening bell Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   In the last reported quarter  Regeneron beat earnings expectations by 14 9   The company s track record is excellent  In the last four quarters  it surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions  with average beat of 8 2   Let s see how things are shaping up for the to be reported quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model indicates that Regeneron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  4 65   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is  5 45  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is  5 21  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell  before they re reported  with our  
Zacks Rank  Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the possibility of a beat 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Regeneron s key growth driver  Eylea  is likely to continue contributing to the company s top line growth  Eylea is approved in the United States  EU  Japan and other countries for the treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration  wet AMD   diabetic macular edema  DME   and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion  which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion 
We note that Regeneron has a global development and commercialization agreement with Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY    outside the United States  for Eylea  Product revenues from ex U S  Eylea sales are recorded by Bayer 
Meanwhile  Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea label into additional indications  which should further boost sales   In August 2018  the FDA approved a 12 week dosing interval of Eylea Injection in patients with wet age related macular degeneration  wet AMD  based on physician s assessment  A supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  has been submitted to the FDA for diabetic retinopathy population  
The phase III trial  PANORAMA  evaluating Eylea injection in patients suffering from moderately severe and severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy met its one year  52 week  primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints  The supplemental application for Eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy  based on previously announced 24 week results  is currently under FDA review with an action date of May 13  2019 
Apart from Eylea s performance and label expansion efforts  investors will be focussing on the uptake of Dupixent and Kevzara 
Strong Dupixent sales drove Regeneron s impressive second quarter results and we expect the momentum to continue in the third quarter as well  Dupixent is already approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  The company and partner Sanofi   NYSE SNY   are also working to expand Dupixent s label  The FDA recently approved Dupixent as an add on maintenance therapy for patients suffering from moderate to severe asthma aged 12 years or older  with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma 
Regeneron and Sanofi are evaluating Dupixent in a broad range of clinical development programs  for diseases driven by allergic or type 2 inflammation  Last month  both the companies announced that the two phase III studies on Dupixent for the indication of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  CRSwNP  were successful 
Kevzara  an anti interleukin  IL  6 receptor monoclonal antibody for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  was approved by the FDA in May 2017  The uptake of the drug has been encouraging so far

110083,331598,ALNY,5 Top Drug Biotech Merger   Acquisition Targets For 2019 ,opinion,As far as M A activity in the biotech drug sector is concerned  2018 started with a bang with expectations of record breaking activity in the year  The new tax reforms left more cash in the hands of drug biotech companies that could be invested for M A activity  The first few months lived up to the bullish expectations but the number of mergers and acquisitions dwindled thereafter  probably because potential acquisition targets demanded a premium Key acquisitions this year included Bayer s  63 billion buyout of Monsanto  NYSE MON   Sanofi s   NYSE SNY   multi billion dollar buyouts of Ablynx and Bioverativ  Celgene s   NASDAQ CELG   purchase of Juno Therapeutics  Novartis   NVS  acquisition of AveXis and Roche s  RHHBY  purchase of Foundation Medicine  Meanwhile  Irish firm  Shire is due to be acquired by Japan s Takeda early next year for a whopping sum of almost  62 billion  Glaxo  earlier this month  announced a definitive agreement to acquire small cancer biotech  TESARO  Inc   TSRO  for  5 1 billion  The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019  Also  Glaxo s  13 billion buyout of Novartis  36 5  stake in their consumer health care joint venture in June was given a heads up by the investor community Overall  the outlook for pharma biotech M A deal remains bullish for 2019 due to growing availability of capital for these firms and a lot of innovation happening in the  companies regularly merge with or acquire competitors in mega deals to achieve critical mass both in research and development  R D  and sales and marketing  Meanwhile  smaller biotech research firms investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates have also attracted the attention of larger counterparts in the last few years Historically  the drug biotech industry probably sees more merger and acquisition  M A  activity than any other industry to get access to innovation  share pipeline development costs  eliminate competition and bolster product portfolios   The major drug biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers into their pipeline product portfolios   either from internal development or from the purchase of assets  Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch  large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines In this article  we discuss some mid  and large cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for big dug biotech companies like Gilead  NASDAQ GILD   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Merck  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and others  What matters for buying a drug biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs products  prospects of future sales growth  and the quality of the pipeline  The fields that have attracted a lot of industry attention lately are immuno oncology treatments and drugs to combat rare diseases The five companies discussed herein have most of these factors going in their favor  Acquisitions of small drug biotech companies are difficult to predict and are quite frequent  Hence  these have been excluded from the discussion BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN  Companies whose product portfolio pipeline includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits  BioMarin is one such drug developer  Its market cap is around  17 billion BioMarin has seven commercially approved rare disease drugs with some more in the pipeline  which makes it worthy of being considered for a buyout  BioMarin s key orphan disease drugs   Vimizim and Kuvan   continue to do well  backed by strong underlying patient demand trends  The newest rare disease drug in its portfolio  Palynziq s commercial launch is off to an encouraging start  BioMarin believes the injection has peak commercial opportunity of roughly  1 billion as it demonstrated dramatic Phe reductions in PKU patients in pivotal studies  BioMarin s impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well  Growing pipeline focus toward gene therapy agents is encouragingThere has been speculation about BioMarin s takeover for a long time  Companies like Gilead  Amgen and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ VRTX  Vertex s holds a dominant position in the cystic fibrosis  CF  market  Consistent increase in eligible patient population for Vertex s CF drugs  Kalydeco   Orkambi  is driving sales growth  Vertex is also working on getting its CF medicines approved for even younger patients  approvals for which can further expand the eligible patient population and drive sales Vertex s third CF medicine Symdeko  a tezacaftor ivacaftor combo was approved in the United States in February and is off to a strong start  Symdeko has been a significant contributor to growth in 2018  Approval of Symdeko in EU in November should further boost sales in 2019 Vertex s CF pipeline is also accelerating rapidly  Studies on Vertex s triple combination CF regimens are moving fast  The CF triple pill regimes are crucial for long term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90  of CF patients  Meanwhile  Vertex s non CF pipeline  though in early stage  looks interesting Vertex  with a market cap is around  44 billion  could prove to be a good acquisition option for PfizerIncyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   Incyte s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead  Amgen and Bristol Myers  The market cap of Incyte is around  14 billion The primary reason behind Incyte being a strong buyout target is its key marketed product  Jakafi  a JAK inhibitor  It is the first and the only product to be approved for polycythemia vera  PV  and myelofibrosis   MF     two rare blood cancers  Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications  In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug  the company is working on expanding its label further Another asset of interest to investors is Olumiant  also a JAK inhibitor  marketed in the EU and the United States  only the lower 2 mg dose  for rheumatoid arthritis  RA   Meanwhile  Incyte s pipeline boasts interesting targeted therapies like pemigatinib  itacitinib and capmatinib among others Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN  Like BioMarin  Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra rare disorders  Its key drug is Soliris  approved for three severe and ultra rare disorders   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH   atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS  and generalized myasthenia gravis  gMG    has consistently done well Alexion is working on expanding the drug s label to include additional indications  which if approved  can boost further sales growth  It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma  which are emerging as key growth drivers  benefiting from continued patient additions  Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow up candidate  Ultomiris  formerly ALXN1210   Ultomiris could be approved for the PNH indication in February next year Roche  Pfizer  or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion  The market cap of Alexion is more than  25 billion Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY  Alnylam  though a relatively smaller biotech compared to the previous four  has become a hot acquisition target after approval of its key pipeline candidate  Onpattro  patisiran  in the United States and Europe this year Onpattro is the first of its kind RNA interference  RNAi  therapeutic approved for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin mediated  hATTR  amyloidosis in adults  Onpattro is the first and only FDA approved treatment for this indication  Meanwhile  Alnylam also boasts two late stage pipeline candidates in its portfolio  givosiran for acute hepatic porphyrias and inclisiran for hypercholesterolemia  Sanofi  PA SASY  could be interested in buying Alnylam considering their ongoing partnership for rare genetic disease programsThe market cap of Alnylam is around  8 billion Looking for Stocks with

110113,331628,ALNY,Alnylam Reports Positive Data On Lumasiran In Renal Disease ,opinion,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   announced new positive results from its phase I II study on its experimental RNAi therapeutic candidate  lumasiran  which targets glycolate oxidase  GO   The data was presented at the OxalEurope  European Hyperoxaluria Consortium  in Naples  Italy 
The candidate is being evaluated for the treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1  PH1  
The data presented was from part B of the study with a cut off date of Mar 29  2018  The part B of the study is a randomized  3 1 drug placebo   single blind  placebo controlled evaluation of lumasiran in patients with PH1 
While cohorts 1 and 2 received three monthly doses of lumasiran at 1 mg kg or 3 mg kg  respectively  cohort 3 received two quarterly doses at 3 mg kg  The study also enrolled an additional eight patients who received open label lumasiran in expansions of each of the first two cohorts  totaling 20 patients enrolled  In addition  patients randomized to the placebo group also received subsequent subcutaneous administration of lumasiran  following administration of placebo 
The results showed that lumasiran demonstrated a mean maximal reduction in urinary oxalate of 64  in patients enrolled in cohorts 1 3  N 12   while all lumasiran treated patients experienced a lowering in urinary oxalate below 0 7 mmol 24 hrs 1 73m2  a threshold level associated with a reduced rate of progression to end stage renal disease 
Meanwhile  patients receiving lumasiran  N 9  maintained a mean reduction in urinary oxalate of 63  on day 85 
Consequently  Alnylam believes that the potent and durable reductions in urinary oxalate support a once quarterly  subcutaneous dose regimen 
The results also indicate that GO inhibition has the potential to reduce and possibly normalize levels of hepatic oxalate production  thus potentially halting PH1 disease progression 
The company continues to dose patients in Part B of the phase I II study  Eligible patients are being transitioned into an open label extension  OLE  study 
Alnylam expects to present additional data from all cohorts as well as from the OLE study in late 2018 
The candidate was generally well tolerated in all patients in the study  We remind investors that lumasiran has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA and Priority Medicines  PRIME  designation from the European Medicines Agency  EMA   The candidate also enjoys the orphan drug status both in the United States and Europe 
Alnylam and the FDA have recently agreed on a pivotal study design for lumasiran including a primary endpoint at six months  based on reduction of urinary oxalate and a study size of approximately 25 patients with PH1  The company plans to initiate the phase III trial in mid 2018 
Alnylam s share price has lost 21 8  in the last six months compared with a 6 8  decline for the  

 
Alnylam is developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference  Alnylam filed its first new drug application  NDA  and marketing authorisation application  MAA  for lead candidate  patisiran 
The European Medicines Agency  EMA  has accepted the MAA and initiated its review  In February 2018  Alnylam announced that the FDA has accepted its NDA and granted priority review with an action date of Aug 11  2018  A potential approval and successful commercialization will be a significant boost for the company  as it will begin generating product revenues in 2018 
Meanwhile  Alnylam has entered into several collaborations for the development and commercialization of its broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutic candidates  These include collaborations with Sanofi s   NYSE SNY   Genzyme and The Medicines Co    NASDAQ MDCO   among others  In March 2018  Alnylam announced a discovery collaboration with Regeneron   NASDAQ REGN   for identification of RNAi therapeutics for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   chronic liver disease and other related diseases

Review 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Are You A Contrarian Trend Follower  After explaining that there is such a thing as a contrarian trend follower  as contradictory as it may sound   we considered how it can work strongly in your favor  A glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  How Do You Allocate Your Trade Risk Budget 
According to an excellent article by Peter Way     playing the market is neither an art nor a science  but rather similar to a game of poker where the results depend  in part  on other players actions that are out of your control  Peter explains one thing that is certain  however  is an occasional loss  No one wins every hand of poker  and no one wins every trade  The question for market participants  is how will you allocate your risk budget  If time is a high cost for you  then you might consider a passive strategy instead of active one 
And if you are going to consider an active strategy  then there are lots of ways to allocate your trading risk budget  For example  Corey Hoffstein does an excellent job of explaining three categories of how traders may spend their risk budget in this article 

Corey explains the  What  is asset diversification  Specifically  what asset class are you going to invest in  Stocks   bonds   tulips  The  How  is process diversification  For example  are you going to make decisions based on value or momentum   Corey shares data on the attractiveness of momentum   trend following strategies   And the  When  is  timing luck   At first  the word luck may sound unimpressive  However  it s actually quite insightful  in our view  because it deals with the important  but often overlooked  concept of  what opportunities is the market providing at the time of rebalancing   Very astute concept by Corey 
Further still  another useful concept when considering your trading risk budget is the importance of listening to your  internal dialogue   i e   the self talk that we engage in throughout our waking hours    As usual  Dr  Brett Steenbarger s article on internal dialogue is both fascinating and practical 

Of course  position sizing  and  knowing when to cut your losses  are two additional very important risk budgeting concepts to consider  In addition to position sizing and dynamic stop orders  our models also diversify across strategies and  timing luck   to name just a few 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models 

We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And for these reasons  I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination

Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger   a source for independent investment ideas  
Holmes  This week I like Yandex  NASDAQ YNDX   It is an Internet search engine out of Russia 
Blue Harbinger  Interesting Holmes  Russia has been an important topic in the news lately for multiple reasons  Why do you like Yandex 
Holmes  Well as you know  I am a contrarian  And based on the following chart  you can see Yandex is providing quite a dip buying opportunity 

BH  Yes  I see the obvious dip  but that is certainly driven  in part  by the news  I realize that Yandex s revenues have been increasing dramatically in recent year  but aren t you just a little bit nervous about the geopolitics 

Holmes  I am a trading model  not a person  So no I am not  nervous   I typically hold my positions for about 6 weeks  and I generally exit when my price target is achieved 
BH  I have to admit  this is a tempting trade Holmes  and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention  However  unlike you I am a human  and even though Yandex appears to be a healthy growing company  my nerves just won t let me pull the trigger  I ll be watching this trade closely 
Holmes  Objectively speaking  you ll likely be sitting on the sidelines while I generate attractive profits  Anyway  how about you  Road Runner any trades this week 
Road Runner  Yes  this week I like Burlington Stores  NYSE BURL   Ever heard of it 
BH  Yes it s the old Burlington Coat Factory  I m surprised you re even considering a brick and mortar retailer  Apparently you trading models don t watch the new because if you did you might be afraid that the Internet  e g  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   is going to put all brick and mortar retailers out of business  and Holmes would be too concerned to even consider Yandex   Nonetheless  why do you like Burlington Stores  Road Runner 
RR  I am a trend follower  and I typically like to hold stocks for about 4 weeks  Check out the following chart  Burlington has some serious momentum 

BH  Yes  Burlington has some momentum  And even though your chart only goes back about a month  this stock s momentum has been continuing a lot longer than that arguably since the start of 2016  with a few relatively small pullbacks   This is so shocking to me because most retailers are getting killed  However  if I look at the financials  revenues are growing  net income is growing  and the balance sheet isn t terrible  Plus  they beat earnings expectations last month  gross margin improved  comps improved  and guidance is strong  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Road Runner  Thanks for the fundamentals  Blue Harbinger  but I am a trader  not an investor  I ll be out of this trade in about 4 weeks  long before the long term fundamental story plays out 
BH  Thanks for sharing your Burlington trade  Road Runner  That retailer is an anomaly compared to the larger retail bloodbath narrative  Anyway  how about you  Felix any trades this week 
Felix  Yep I sold my Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALNY  shares on April 4th  I bought them on February 16th  if you recall 

BH  Looks like this one didn t go exactly your way  but as Peter Way explained earlier in this report you can t win them all  And I ll certainly cut you some slack considering your 6 and 12 month track record is very strong  as shown in the performance table earlier in this report  Why d you sell 
Felix  It hit one of our dynamic stop loss orders  You know  one of the whole  knowing when to cut your losses  thing that was mentioned earlier in this report when we were talking about  risk budgets  
BH  Got it  Felix  Thanks for sharing  Do you have anything else for us 
Felix  Yes  here is a ranking of my top 20 stocks in the High Liquidity S P Midcap 

BH  Interesting selection universe  Felix  Regardless  I like to know what you are  thinking   so thanks for sharing these ideas  And how about you  Athena any trades this week 
Athena  Yes  This week I bought Twitter  NYSE TWTR  on April 9th  If you recall  I previously bought these shares during the week of February 22nd  I sold them in March  and I am rebuying them now at a lower price  What can I say I am a trader  Here is a look at the charts 


BH  It looks like you did alright with this one the last time around  Why do you like Twitter though 
Athena  Because  simply stated  I am a momentum trader  On average  I hold my positions for around 17 weeks  but I generally exit when my price target is hit or when my stops get activated 
BH  Okay  Well I m not sure if I like that CEO  Jack Dorsey  splits his time between Twitter and Square  NYSE SQ   Seems like an odd arrangement  and I question his focus  Seems like both positions require more time than he is giving  Anyway  how about you  Oscar any trades 
Oscar  No trades to share  but I do have a ranking to share  The following table includes my top 20 ETFs from my comprehensive and diverse ETFs universe 

BH  Thanks for sharing  Oscar  I enjoy these rankings  Your ETF momentum style is interesting to me  especially considering you rotate to a new ETF every 6 weeks  on average 
Conclusion 
In poker  no one wins every hand  and in trading no one wins every trade  The key is to make more money on your winners than you lose on your losers  One way to improve your chances  or at least limit your losses  is the concept of  risk budgeting   There are multiple ways to think about risk  and to budget your risk exposures  For example  we like to employ process diversification  across trend following and dip buying   position sizing  and knowing when to cut losses  stops   to name just a few  How do you budget your risk exposures 
Background On The Stock Exchange 
Each week  Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends  Since they are all traders  they love to discuss their best current ideas before the game starts  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange    Check out  for more background   Their methods are excellent  as you know if you have been following the series  Since the time frames and risk profiles differ  so do the stock ideas  You get to be a fly on the wall from my report  I am usually the only human present and the only one using any fundamental analysis 
The result  Several expert ideas each week from traders  and a brief comment on the fundamentals from the human investor  The models are named to make it easy to remember their trading personalities

110149,331664,ALNY,Alnylam  ALNY  Reports Positive Data For RNAi Candidate,opinion,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   announced positive results from phase I and phase I II open label extension  OLE  studies of givosiran  which is being evaluated for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias  AHPs  
Shares of the company increased 88 1  against the  s decline of 8 5  

 
Givosiran is an investigational  subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1  ALAS1  
The double blind  placebo controlled phase I study showed that compared with a once quarterly dose regimen  monthly dosing led to an over 80  lowering of urinary aminolevulinic acid   ALA    a disease biomarker  and an over 75  decrease in mean annualized porphyria attack rate  relative to placebo  Increasing the monthly dose from 2 5 mg kg to 5 0 mg kg did not lead to further lowering of ALA and PBG levels  
Monthly dosing regimens led to increased clinical activity as compared to quarterly dosing  A continuous relationship between greater ALA lowering and AAR reduction was also observed 
The study showed enhanced clinical activity with long term treatment of up to 22 months in the ongoing phase I II OLE study  with an over 90  decrease in mean annualized porphyria attack rate  relative to baseline run in attack rate  The extent of these reductions in the OLE study exceeded that observed in response to givosiran treatment during the phase I study  suggesting that extended dosing at 2 5 mg kg monthly potentially leads to enhanced clinical activity  
Clinical activity and safety results support accelerated efforts to bring givosiran to patients with acute hepatic porphyrias 
The company also announced that that it will continue to enroll patients in the ENVISION phase III pivotal study  which was initiated at the end of 2017  The company also expects to enroll the thirtieth patient into ENVISION in the coming weeks in support of the planned interim analysis in mid 2018  which  if positive  would support a potential new drug application filing for givosiran by end of 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price

110190,331705,ALNY,What s In Store For Ligand  LGND  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ LGND   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results on Nov 9  after the market closes  Ligand s earnings history has been a mixed bag with the company having surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two  It also delivered an average positive surprise of 6 19  Ligand Pharmaceuticals Price and EPS Surprise

   Ligand s shares have outperformed the  so far this year  The stock has rallied 44 1  compared with the industry s 3 9  increase  
Last quarter  Ligand delivered a positive earnings surprise of 67 50   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Ligand s Captisol formulation technology has helped it form partnerships with several leading healthcare companies that provide it with funds as milestone and royalty payments  Royalties depend on the sales of its two key partnered assets   Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   Kyprolis and Amgen s Promacta 
We expect investors  focus to remain on the company s updates regarding partnerships and major pipeline assets on the third quarter conference call 
In July  the company announced that it has entered into another commercial license and supply agreement with Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   granting it rights to use Captisol in the formulation of its anti CD33 x anti CD3  BiTE  bispecific antibody  AMG 330  Per the agreement terms  Ligand is entitled to potential milestone payments  royalties and revenues from the future sales of AMG 330 
Notably in October  Ligand inked a deal to acquire Crystal Bioscience  Pursuant to the acquisition  Crystal Bioscience s HuMab technology will be part of Ligand s OmniAb brand and be called OmniChicken  Addition of the OmniChicken platform to Ligand s OmniAb technology supplements a third species for the fully humanized antibody discovery 
Ligand anticipates Crystal Bioscience s acquisition to contribute up to  1 million of revenues during the fourth quarter of 2017  It thus raised the total revenue guidance for 2017 to at least  134 million compared with the previous guidance of  133 million 
We expect an update on several major pipeline assets in the company s portfolio on the third quarter conference call  With regard to its internal pipeline  various candidates are being developed for indications like diabetes  One of the most advanced candidates is LGD 6972  presently undergoing a phase II study for treatment of type II diabetes  The company reported positive top line data from the study in September  It further expects LGD 6972 to bring in future licensing opportunities 
Operating expenses differ on a quarterly basis  depending mainly on the timing of costs associated with internal programs and business development activities 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ligand is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a bullish Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  Ligand has an Earnings ESP of  15 00   representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 51 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Though Ligand s Zacks Rank of 1 increases the predictive power of ESP  a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  Hence  the combination leaves the case inconclusive 
We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Some health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter are 
Agenus Inc    NASDAQ AGEN   is scheduled to release results on Nov 7  The company has an Earnings ESP of  8 11  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   is scheduled to release results on Nov 7  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 02  and a Zacks Rank  3

110191,331706,ALNY,Alnylam s  ALNY  Q3 Earnings  Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   incurred a loss of  1 34 per share in the third quarter of 2017  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 23  The figure was also wider than the year ago loss of  1 21 
Quarterly revenues improved 25 2  to 17 1 million  However  the same missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  37 million  The top line in the quarter included  14 6 million earned under the company s collaboration agreement with Sanofi s   NYSE SNY   subsidiary  Genzyme as well as  2 3 million from the company s alliance with The Medicines Company   NASDAQ MDCO   and  0 2 million from other sources 
So far this year  Alnylam s stock has increased 245 8  compared with the  s growth of  3 3  

Quarter in Detail
Research and development expenses declined 2 7  from the year ago period to  95 3 million  However  general and administrative expenses more than doubled to  47 6 million 
Guidance
Alnylam remains on track to end 2017 with greater than  1 billion in cash  cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities including  150 million in restricted investments 
Pipeline Updates
Alnylam reported positive phase III study results from the APOLLO study evaluating patisiran an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of patients with hereditary ATTR  hATTR  amyloidosis with polyneuropathy  Based on these results  the company plans to submit a new drug application  NDA  for patisiran by the end of 2017 and a Marketing Authorization Application  MAA  thereafter  Notably  it expects to receive approval by mid 2018 
Alnylam initiated the ENVISION phase III program for givosiran in acute hepatic porphyrias as well 
Moreover  the company and its partner  The Medicines Company  commenced the ORION 11 phase III study of inclisiran  an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 in development for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  ASCVD  
Again  the company initiated the ATLAS phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran in patients with hemophilia A and B with or without inhibitors 
Meanwhile  Alnylam suspended dosing in all ongoing studies of fitusiran temporarily  This was due to a fatal thrombotic serious adverse event that occurred in a patient with hemophilia A without inhibitors who was receiving fitusiran in the phase II OLE study  It plans to resume dosing in all studies as soon as possible  potentially by the end of 2017 
Our Take
Alnylam s reported wider than expected loss and sales miss in the third quarter  With several pipeline related events lined up for the upcoming quarters  we expect investor s focus to remain on further updates by the company 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Alnylam carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked health care stock in the same space is Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ LGND   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Ligand s earnings per share estimates have moved up  3 68 to  3 70 for 2018 over the last 30 days  The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 6 19   The share price of the company has increased 44  year to date

110229,331744,ALNY,4 Biotech Stocks That More Than Doubled This Year,opinion,The second quarter reporting cycle has almost ended with only nine S P 500 stocks left to report as of Aug 25  2017  All the sectors  excluding Auto and Conglomerates  have recorded earnings growth in the quarter  Total earnings increased 11 2  in the second quarter on the back of 5 6  revenue growth from the year ago period The pharma and biotech sector has performed well in the first half  The sector was in turmoil in 2016 due to the drug pricing controversy brought forward by presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton in her campaign  However  defying all odds and uncertainties surrounding Obamacare  the sector has turned around this year  Although drug pricing risk still persists  investors are seemingly comfortable with the scenario and are focused on the fundamentals The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen almost 10  year to date  YTD  after declining almost 10  last year  The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 25 9  YTD after sliding 19 1  in 2016 In fact  the  sector is up 9 6  YTD  However  the S P 500 has risen 10 6  in the period Impressive 1H   Rising ApprovalsThe Medical sector had recorded earnings growth of 5 7  on revenue growth of 5 8  in the first quarter  In the second quarter  with 98 2  of companies having reported so far  earnings have grown 6 7  on revenue growth of 4 2   A look at the beat ratio shows earnings beat of 83 3  and revenue beat of 64 8  in the second quarter Within the sector  biotech stocks performed particularly well as most of the key players beat earnings and revenue expectations  A few companies in the sub sector have also raised their outlook for 2017  Sales of new drugs were also impressive  which is expected to offset the impact of genericization of key drugs to an extent  Moreover  pipeline candidates have progressed well as evident from the positive results announced in the first half  The companies are also focusing on newer categories like gene editing  NASH and Parkinson s disease Based on the present trend  2017 is expected to see far more approvals than 2016  The agency has already approved a total of 31 drugs so far this year compared to 22 for the whole of 2016 Meanwhile  tax reforms and cash repatriation policies should give pharma biotech companies more cash flexibility to pursue acquisitions deals However  with many companies fighting to bring their therapies to the market  competition is intensifying  Loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs  high profile pipeline setback and drug pricing issue still remains a concern for the sector Nonetheless  the rest of 2017 is expected to be eventful with quite a few companies expected to announce data on their pipeline candidates being developed across a wide range of therapeutics areas  We note that the first half was rather quiet in terms of mergers   acquisitions and collaborations deals  However  there are chances that it will pick up in the second half  beginning with Gilead s acquisition of Kite Pharma for almost  12 billion Stocks in FocusGiven this favorable scenario  many biotech stocks have shown an impressive run in

110247,331762,ALNY,Inovio  INO  Q3 Earnings  Is A Beat In Store For The Stock ,opinion,"We expect Inovio Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INO   to beat expectations when it reports third quarter 2017 results on Nov 8  after market close Inovio s shares have underperformed the  so far this year  The stock has lost 16 9  versus the industry s increase of 3 9  during the period 

Inovio s earnings performance is a mixed bag  The company surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two  Overall  the company delivered an average negative surprise of 0 41  in the trailing four quarters Inovio Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Last quarter  the company beat estimates with a positive earnings surprise of 18 75   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Given that Inovio s portfolio is devoid of any revenue generating product  investors  focus will remain on its pipeline and regulatory updates 
VGX 3100 vaccine is the most advanced candidate in the company s pipeline  It is being studied for treatment of HPV 16 and HPV 18 infection and pre cancerous lesions of the cervix and vulva  Inovio at present conducts a pivotal phase III REVEAL study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VGX 3100 and treat cervical dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus   HPV    Data from the study will support the potential licensure of VGX 3100 as the first immunotherapy for this disease 
Apart from VGX 3100  Inovio has several other candidates in its pipeline in early to mid stage development  Also  the company is working on the development of Ebola  Zika and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus vaccines  In October  the company announced positive data from phase I study  evaluating its Zika vaccine  GLS 5700 
Inovio is also collaborating with several companies and institutes for developing its pipeline  These partners not only lend their expertise to Inovio but also provide the required funding for developing its candidates 
This month  Inovio has initiated a phase Ib IIa immuno oncology study  evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy of Regeneron s   NASDAQ REGN   PD 1 inhibitor  REGN2810  with Inovio s T cell activator  INO 5401  on patients with brain cancer  Earlier in October  the company also initiated a phase Ib II immuno oncology study  evaluating INO 5401 in combination with Roche s Tecentriq on patients with metastatic bladder cancer 
However  with dearth of an approved product in its portfolio  Inovio depends largely on collaborations  grants and other payments for revenues as well as development of its pipeline candidates  Hence  the company s top line varies on a quarterly basis  depending on the timing of its receipt of collaboration revenues 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model shows that Inovio is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen 
Zacks ESP  Inovio has an Earnings ESP of  41 79   representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate  loss of 13 cents per share  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  loss of 22 cents   A positive ESP indicates a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Inovio has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP 
We caution against all Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Other Stocks That Warrant a Look
A couple of other health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter are 
Agenus Inc    NASDAQ AGEN   is scheduled to release results on Nov 7  The company has an Earnings ESP of  8 11  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   is scheduled to release results on Nov 7  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 02  and a Zacks Rank of 3

Revenues came in at  875 7 million in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  847 million  However  the top line was down 5  year over year as generic competition is adversely impacting the branded established products portfolio 
Shares of the company were up in pre market trading following the release  But  we note that shares of Endo have underperformed the  year to date  The stock has been down 45 8  against the industry s gain of 1 4  during the same period

U S  Generic Pharmaceuticals recorded sales of  563 3 million in the quarter  marginally up 0 3  from the year ago period as decline in the generics base business was significantly offset by launch of the generic version of neostigmine methylsulfate injection  along with the robust performance of sterile injectables  However  generics base business revenues declined approximately 34  due to increased competition and previously announced product discontinuances 
Notably  Endo s sold its South African subsidiary  Litha Healthcare Group to Acino Pharma  AG  in Jul 2017  which was completed last month  The company also announced that it will sell its Mexican subsidiary  Somar to Advent International  The transaction will close  in early fourth quarter

Revenues in the U S  segment were up 5  to  623 million  Within this segment  sales of companion animal products were up 7   reflecting higher sales of dermatology portfolio and product launches  Simparica Chewables and Cytopoint   partially offset by lower sales of pain products  Livestock revenues rose 3  mainly due to increased sales of cattle and poultry products  partially offset by lower swine product sales 
Revenues at the International segment grew 5   up 7  operationally  on a reported basis to  634 million  Sales of livestock products were up 2  on a reported basis  up 3  operationally  in the quarter due to increased sales of swine products in China and cattle products in Brazil  Nonetheless  livestock sales were adversely impacted by product rationalizations 
Sales of companion animal products grew 12  on a reported basis  up 15  operationally   driven by higher sales of Apoquel and product launches  particularly that of Simparica 
2017 Outlook Updated

Other Updates
The company received approval for Clavamox Chewable in the U S  in May 2017  Cytopoint in the European Union in Apr 2017 and in Canada in Mar 2017  The approvals will help the company to strengthen its canine dermatology portfolio  In fact  Cytopoint is the first monoclonal antibody  mAb  therapy approved to help provide a reduction in the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis such as itching in dogs 
Zoetis has expanded its dermatology portfolio following approval for Apoquel in Vietnam  Cytopoint in New Zealand and Simparica in Peru 
Subsequent to the quarter  the company completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma plc  The latter is an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals used in managing chronic pain as well as in other therapeutic areas 
Our Take
Zoetis  second quarter results were better than expected  Performance of the companion animal business was encouraging due to higher global sales of Apoquel and other new products  The company also increased its outlook for 2017 
Notably  successful launches and expansion of markets boosted performance in the quarter  However  unfavorable currency movement continued to hurt the top line Zoetis Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Evinacumab is an experimental monoclonal antibody to angiopoietin like protein 3  ANGPTL3   which acts as an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase  and plays a central role in lipoprotein metabolism  Regeneron s share price shows that the company has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date  The stock is down 3 4  against the industry s gain of 2 3  

Last May   Regeneron presented positive data from preliminary results from a single arm  open label  phase II proof of concept study on evinacumab in patients suffering from homozygous familial hypercholestrolemia at the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress 
Breakthrough Therapy designation was created to speed up the development and review of drugs that target serious or life threatening conditions 
Interim data showed that evinacumab in combination with other lipid lowering therapies resulted in a mean reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol  LDL C  in the first 4 patients by an additional 55  at week 4 compared to baseline  which was also the primary endpoint of the study  Between these four patients  the percent reductions in LDL C ranged from 25 90   Overall  the patients enrolled in the study saw their mean LDL C levels decrease from 331mg dL at baseline to 175mg dL at week 4 
HoFH  is a rare and most severe form of hypercholesterolemia  It  occurs  in about one to two people per million and the  untreated patients can have LDL cholesterol levels ranging from 500 to 1000 mg dL compared to normal LDL cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg dL  In fact  due to the high levels of LDL cholesterol  patients with HoFH are at an extreme risk of premature cardiovascular disease 
Regeneron is also planning a phase III study for evinacumab We remind investors that in March 2017  another company Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   and its partner The Medicines Company   NASDAQ MDCO   announced positive final results from the phase II study  ORION 1  on their experimental PCSK9 inhibitor  inclisiran  which is being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  In Jan 2017  Medicines Company  announced the initiation of ORION 2 for evaluating the efficacy  safety and tolerability of Inclisiran in patients with HoFH Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price

Alnylam s share price has increased 47  year to date  while the Zacks classified  industry gained 3 9  

Quarter in Detail
Research and development  R D  expenses fell 9 7  from the year ago period to  87 million primarily due to higher expenses related to lower stock based compensation expenses and external services expenses related to pre clinical activities 
Likewise  general and administrative  G A  expenses increased 82 5  to  38 5 million  The increase was primarily due to higher compensation as headcount was increased to support growth  Further  expenses also increased for the potential launch of patisiran during the quarter 
Guidance
Alnylam expects its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including restricted investments  to be greater than  700 million at the end of the year 
Pipeline
Alnylam has been making progress as far as the development of its candidates is concerned  The company reported positive clinical results with fitusiran for haemophilia in Feb 2017  In Mar 2017  the European Medicines Agency  EMA  granted givosiran  ALN AS1  PRIME Designation for accelerated assessment for the treatment of porphyria based on positive data from a phase I study 
Additionally  the company along with The Medicines Company also reported positive final clinical data from Orion 1 phase II study on inclisiran for hypercholesterolemia  Inclisiran significantly reduced LDL C and sustained over time  Subsequent to the quarter  in Apr 2017  The Medicines Company announced an agreement with the FDA on plans for phase III study on inclisiran  The primary endpoint will be change in LDL C from baseline 
The company expects 2017 to be a pivotal year with its first phase III data read out   APOLLO for its late stage pipeline candidate patisiran by mid 2017 and expects to submit applications for regulatory approvals in the U S  and Europe at year end 
Our Take

We note that IONIS TTRRx is being developed by Ionis in collaboration with Glaxo for all forms of TTR amyloidosis  Per the terms of the agreement  Glaxo has an option to exclusively license the IONIS TTRRx program 
The recent development came in the wake of the FDA placing a clinical hold on CARDIO TTR due to safety concerns that were raised in the ongoing phase III study  NEURO TTR  early last month  This study is evaluating IONIS TTRRx for the treatment of patients with TTR familial amyloid polyneuropathy as well as TTR related cardiomyopathy using a cardiac sub study to evaluate patients who have cardiac involvement in addition to their polyneuropathy  Data from the NEURO TTR study is anticipated in the first half of 2017 
Also  Dr  Merrill Benson is assessing IONIS TTRRx in an investigator initiated open label phase II study in patients with TTR related amyloid cardiomyopathy  Ionis intends to present updated data from Dr  Benson s study at the International Symposium on Amyloidosis this July 
Data from both these studies are expected to offer essential information on patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy  which will help design a phase III study 
Per Ionis  press release  the company is working with Glaxo on filing a new drug application for IONIS TTRRx  The press release also noted that Glaxo remains dedicated toward the development of drugs for the treatment of amyloidosis as well as to its collaboration with Ionis for the development of IONIS TTRRx for the treatment of TTR amyloidosis

We note that both patisiran and revusiran are experimental RNAi therapeutics targeting transthyretin  TTR  and are being evaluated for the treatment of hereditary TTR mediated amyloidosis  hATTR amyloidosis  
Data from the single arm phase II OLE study showed that following 24 months of treatment with patisiran  hATTR patients with polyneuropathy  hATTR PN  also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  witnessed improvement or no change in the mean neuropathy impairment score  Overall  these data support the therapeutic hypothesis that reduction of mutant and wild type TTR with patisiran has the potential to halt or improve neuropathy progression in patients with hATTR PN 
Alnylam also presented baseline demographics from the APOLLO phase III study on patisiran in hATTR PN patients  which showed that a significant number of patients  54   demonstrated evidence of cardiac disease  The company believes this patient subset should allow for a controlled evaluation of effects of patisiran on cardiac parameters  Alnylam expects to report data from the APOLLO study in mid 2017 
In addition  initial 12 month data from the phase II OLE study revealed that revusiran continued to show robust and sustained knockdown of serum TTR  Moreover  6 minute walk distance results were found to be generally stable in the majority of evaluable hATTR patients with cardiomyopathy  also known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy  
Alnylam also announced that it expects to complete enrollment in the ENDEAVOUR phase III study on revusiran this summer  ahead of schedule  Data readout is now anticipated in early 2018  Previously  the company had expected to complete enrollment in the study in late 2016 while results were projected in mid 2018 
Considering that Alnylam has no approved product in its portfolio  successful development of both patisiran and revusiran is crucial for the company  We expect investor focus to remain on updates pertaining to their development

110351,331866,ALNY,Alnylam  ALNY  Begins Phase I II Study On Chronic HBV Drug,opinion,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALNY   announced that it has initiated a phase I II study on one of its pipeline candidates  ALN HBV  which is a subcutaneously administered experimental RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus  HBV  infection 
The randomized  single blind  placebo controlled study is being conducted in three sequential parts  It will be initially conducted in normal healthy volunteers and then in chronic HBV patients  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple subcutaneous doses of ALN HBV  The company expects to report initial data from the study in mid 2017 
We note that ALN HBV is being developed utilizing the company s enhanced stabilization chemistry GalNAc siRNA conjugate delivery platform ALNYLAM PHARMA Price   We are encouraged by the company s progress with the candidate  Per the company s press release  2 billion people are infected with HBV across the world and 400 million people have become chronically infected  In the U S  alone there are 1 to 2 million people chronically infected with HBV  Moreover  an estimated 1 million people die each year from HBV and its complications worldwide 
Considering that there exists a significant unmet need for drugs targeting chronically infected HBV patients  if developed successfully  ALN HBV could gain an opportunity to cater to a large market 
Meanwhile  Alnylam has made substantial progress with its RNAi therapeutics pipeline  Presently  the two most advanced candidates at Alnylam are patisiran  phase III   familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  and revusiran  phase III   familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy   While Alnylam expects to report data from the APOLLO study on patisiran in mid 2017  data readout from the ENDEAVOUR study on revusiran is anticipated in early 2018

110368,331883,ALNY,Promising RNA Company Tekmira Ready To Release Data ,opinion,Small interfering RNA  siRNA  is a relatively new kind of technology that is being developed into a new generation of therapeutics that targets diseases in a very novel way  While traditional therapies often target proteins through direct inhibition  manipulation of RNA through small interfering molecules can inhibit the production of these proteins  which removes some of the barriers that stood in the way of traditional inhibitors   siRNA has received a fair amount of attention from biotech investors in recent years  although I think that many companies in the space remain undiscovered  One notable example is Tekmira Pharmaceuticals  TKMR   which will be one of the major players in the iRNA space as the technology is developing into more therapeutic products targeting more indications   One fairly recent and particularly notable display of the power of RNA inhibition was seen when Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  published the results of a Phase II trial for the drug eteplirsen  AVI 4658  in the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD    Although patient enrollment into the trial was miniscule  12  due to the small population of the target indication  we saw very significant slowdowns in the deterioration of dystrophin fibers in these patients on top of significant improvements in secondary measures like 6 minute walk test  6 MWT  distances and lymphocyte counts that also show that the drug had a noticeably beneficial effect  While it s still being debated whether or not eteplirsen will become an FDA approved drug on these results alone  I also see it as a very encouraging sign for all RNA based therapeutics going forward   If Sarepta was able to see such stellar results in a previously untreatable and degenerative disease  what else can RNA therapies do for other indications that traditional drugs struggle with  Although their RNA technology is a bit different  Tekmira is one of a handful of companies that is focusing entirely on this with its developmental pipeline   They currently have five programs in preclinical or Phase I development  and have partnerships for another five drugs  The three partnered programs that catch my attention are ALN VSP  ALN TTR  and ALN PCS which are three products being developed with the larger iRNA company Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  ALNY  for the treatment of amyloidosis  solid tumors  and hypercholesterolemia respectively   It s also encouraging to see that Tekmira also holds the rights to five pipeline compounds that target very diverse indications  with my personal favorite being TKM PLK1 which has demonstrated promising anti tumor activity in animal models   While we don t understand the full implications  and limitations  of this new RNA interference technology  the signs that I ve seen thus far are very encouraging for both biotech investors and millions of patients that will need next generation therapeutics that tackle diseases from a different angle   The main problem for iRNA developers now is the overall lack of clinical trial data supporting the technology  although progress is being made at a slow  but steady  pace  I think that biotech   small pharma investors that are interested in holding stocks with a long term outlook should definitely investigate iRNA companies like Tekmira  who are at the very front of the RNA revolution and have intellectual property rights to iRNA development platforms that could be worth significantly more if the industry really does take off   It s because of this in particular that these companies may have a better than average chance of being acquired by larger pharmaceutical companies in coming years  as cash rich big pharma sees dwindling potential in more traditional drugs and development platforms and look to newer sectors for growth potential   Tekmira may garner a lot more interest from Wall Street next week as it presents the results of its phase 1 dose escalation trial for its oncology therapy TKM PLK1 at AACR 2013  American Association for Cancer Research   which is scheduled to take place on April 9th  2013  The abstract  however  should be available as early as April 5th  2013   I think this may provide some liquidity and possible upside potential if this event garners some much needed attention for Tekmira throughout the month ,2013-04-03,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/promising-rna-company-tekmira-ready-to-release-data-161370,161370
110371,331886,ALNY,Will Weakness In Small Cap Stocks Affect The Market Rally ,opinion,Both the large cap Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  and benchmark S P 500 Index  SPX  continue to push higher  and both indexes closed at fresh  multi year highs yesterday  However  we are now seeing bearish divergence in small cap stocks  as the Russell 2000 Index  RUT  has just broken below near term technical support of its 20 day exponential moving average  This breakdown in the Russell is noteworthy because most of the individual stocks we swing trade are either small or mid cap growth stocks Just for some initial perspective  let s check out the weekly chart pattern of the S P 500 SPDR  SPY   an ETF that mirrors the underlying index  As you can see on the chart below  SPY is currently trading well above the dominant uptrend line of the current rally By comparison  the daily chart of the iShares Russell 2000 Index ETF  IWM  shows the recent weakness that has led to a breakdown below three different levels of technical price support  the low of the multi week trading range  around  93   the 20 day exponential moving average  beige line   AND the dominant uptrend line  which began with the November 2012 low  Scaling out to the weekly chart of IWM below  we see two clear support levels at the  92 and  90 area  Please think of support as an area  rather than just a line that must be held to the penny  Stocks and averages can and frequently do  undercut  obvious levels of price support for a few days and bounce right back  we like those plays for buy entry  The  92 level is support because it was a prior resistance level for three weeks in February  Remember that a prior level of resistance becomes the new level of support  after the resistance is broken  technical analysis 101   The rising 10 week moving average  or 50 day moving average  is also converging at the same  92 level  The second level of support is formed by the  swing lows  of late January and late February  around  89    90  Now  let s assess the  big picture  by turning to the long term monthly chart of IWM  Upon doing so  we see there remains a clear uptrend line  with multiple anchor points along the way  that should also provide support around  90  or slightly higher  On both the weekly and monthly chart intervals  there is significant support around the  90 level  The more timeframes and indicators that converge near a certain price  the more substantial that support should become  If the price of IWM was to retrace down to this level  it would only be a 5  6  pullback off the highs of the rally  Within a bull market  a shallow correction of just 5 6  that holds near that level would be a bullish sign that could lead to a strong Q3 and Q4 of this year  The past few days have not been kind to individual leading stocks  which are typically small to mid cap equities   Most stocks that broke out in late February and early March have been running out of steam over the past several days  and are now in pullback mode  Furthemore  stocks that have been forming bullish consolidation  basing  patterns in recent weeks are also beginning to break down  Oil Refiners and Homebuilders are two examples of industry sectors with disappointing price action over the past two weeks  If leading technical setups like Proto Labs  PRLB   United Rentals  URI   SodaStream International  SODA   Ambarella  AMBA   Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  ALNY   DigitalGlobe  DGI   Chuy s Holdings  CHUY   PulteGroup  PHM   D R  Horton  DHI   and Amazong  AMZN  begin to roll over  and the broad market suffers just one more ugly  distribution day   it would be clear signals that the current stock market rally may be entering at least a short term correction  Still  by highlighting the relative weakness in the Russell 2000 Index above  it s important to realize we are NOT calling a top in IWM  Rather  we want to make you aware of key support levels to monitor if recent weakness in small caps persists in the coming days ,2013-04-03,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-weakness-in-small-cap-stocks-affect-the-market-rally-161487,161487
