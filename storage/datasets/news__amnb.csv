lowest level since early February  Meanwhile  the sector recovered on Thursday  rising 0 2   despite fall in key indexes following continued decline in tech stocks  It is quite likely that the recent slump in technology stocks was the reason for the fall in bond yields This means that Wednesday s selloff was a reaction to recent market events and not due to fundamentals  In fact  financials gained since the beginning of this year  on optimism surrounding strong economic expansion and steady job growth  Given the Fed s hawkish stance on rates  investing in financials continues to be a strong option going forward   Amazon Led Tech Stock Decline Weighs on Yields Per Axios  President Trump is somehow  obsessed  with Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   as the president is thinking of changing

suspend all its self driving tests for the time being after a self sufficient car killed a woman in Arizona  Further  news came out that the U S  National Transportation Safety Board will investigate a fatal crash involving one of Tesla s vehicles in California Additionally  Facebook  Inc   NASDAQ FB   fell 8  in the last five trading days following reports that analytics firm Cambridge Analytica easily collected personal information of more 50 million users without their consent  This raised privacy questions on the social networking giant s data management and protection from unauthorized third party access In the absence of other downside risks  it is quite likely that the tech slump weighed on 10 year Treasury bond yields  which fell to 2 77 on Wednesday  Bond yields reached its lowest settlement on Wednesday since Feb 6  Weak bond yields come as dark tidings for financials However  unlike last year when bond yields fell following the Trump government s failure to pass any key economic policies and lower inflation  this year s decline in yields was most likely due to the slump in technology  This means that the decline in financials is not a result of weak fundamental factors  but more a reaction to recent sector specific reverses Rising Rate Hike Prospects  Boon for FinancialsFollowing its two day Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  policy meeting held onMar 20
