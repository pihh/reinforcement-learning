26029,247544,BLKB,Symantec Plunges 13  In Two Weeks  What s Pulling It Down ,opinion,It has been nearly two weeks that Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC   reported second quarter fiscal 2018 results  Ever since Symantec reported its  on Nov 1  the company s shares have lost more than 13  The downtrend stemmed from the company s dismal second quarter results wherein its top and bottom line both fell short of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Furthermore  revenues were in line with the mid point of the company s guidance range  while non GAAP earnings came in at the lower end In addition to this  the cybersecurity company issued disappointing guidance for the next quarter s revenues and earnings  as both fell short of the respective consensus estimates  Moreover  the company s dismal outlook for the full fiscal makes investors worried about its near term performance Notably  Symantec has underperformed the  to which it belongs to in the year to date period  The stock has returned 17 1   while the industry recorded growth of 36 1  during the same time frame Unfavorable Estimate RevisionsFollowing Symantec s dismal performance  the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a downtrend as analysts decreased their estimates  Analysts polled by Zacks are convinced that this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock may witness a lackluster performance in the future as well  Over the past 30 days  the Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2018 moved down by 6 cents and 11 cents  respectively What s Bothering Analysts Analysts covering the stock are cautious about Symantec s future performance due to the factors highlighted by management during the fiscal second quarter earnings conference call  The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more ratable revenue recognition  which resulted in lower than expected revenue growth in the quarter Per Symantec   Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi product deals  which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures  These trends are however also affecting our in period revenue recognition  The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud  subscription and virtual appliance products in multi product deals  The company expects the aforementioned factors will continue to impact its near term results  Therefore  it lowered its revenues and non GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018 Looking aheadApart from the booking mix issue  there is another factor which makes us increasingly cautious about Symantec s near term performance  It should be noted that last month the company announced accomplishing the sale of its Website Security and related PKI business to privately owned DigiCert Inc  This move is believed to be Symantec s effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google  which has accused it for mis issuing over 30 000 of web certifications However  we believe that although the sale of the company s certified authority business will avoid conflicts with Alphabet  the loss of high margin business might hurt Symantec s near term profitability Therefore  we suggest investors to stay away from investing in this stock till we find a better visibility on the company s growth opportunities Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the same industry space are Blackbaud  Inc    NASDAQ BLKB   and Cadence Design Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CDNS    both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Long term expected EPS growth rates for Blackbaud and Cadence Design are 15 9  and 12   respectively Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/symantec-plunges-13-in-two-weeks-whats-pulling-it-down-200264918,200264918
26030,247545,BLKB,Price Gaps And The Need For Exit Strategy Execution ,opinion,"Position management is one of the 3 required skills needed for covered call writing and put selling  When share price gaps up or down there is a strong possibility that an exit strategy opportunity will present itself  There are times  however  when no action is the best action  On June 26th  2017  Luis contacted me about Blackbaud Inc  NASDAQ BLKB  when it gapped down from nearly  90 00 to  85 60  This tends to create a sense of urgency in us to act quickly to mitigate losses  It is important to stick to our game plan so that we make non emotional decisions based on sound fundamental  technical and common sense principles 
Price chart of BLKB showing the gap down  sent from Luis 


What caused the gap down 
We first check the news to see the etiology of the price decline  In June 2017  tech stocks were volatile and declining after a meteoric rise the previous few months  The news events also showed an acquisition by BLKB which just happened to be made public on June 26th 

Price chart of the  90 00 call option
So far there appears to be no reason to panic and act immediately  Remember  we always have our 20  10  guidelines to guide us when to buy back our call options  let s look at a price chart of the 1 month  90 00 call option to see how it was impacted after the news announcement 

The yellow field depicts a slight decline in option value on the 26th despite the price decline  Knowledge of the option Greeks may offer an explanation  Delta is the amount an option value will decline based on every  1 of share price decline  But option value only dropped by about  0 05  A major factor is that when price declines significantly  the implied volatility rises and this will enhance the value of the option  This is analogous to our study of the S P 500 which is inversely related to the CBOE Volatility Index  Based on this chart  the 20  10  guidelines are not met 
Location in contract month
Another factor that dictates what  if any  action is required is the number of days remaining in the contract  After June 26th  there were still 19 trading days remaining until expiration of the July contracts leaving plenty of time for price recovery or appropriate use of our exit strategy arsenal 
Price movement by end of July 2017 contract

After the gap down  blue line  the price fully recovered to  89 33  red line  by the end of the July contracts  If the price continued to decline  the 20  10  guidelines would have resulted in closing the short calls 
Discussion
When there is a price gap down in share value we must act or take no action based on a non emotional analysis  This includes 
Checking the news regarding the reason for the gap down
Analysis of option value in relationship to our 20  10  guidelines
Days remaining until contract expiration
Having a structured approach to investing will allow us to make our decisions without being influenced by two of our most egregious enemies  fear and greed

26031,247546,BLKB,Blackbaud Lands In The Danger Zone,opinion,"Providing software to nonprofits  education institutions  and foundations is certainly a noble business cause  But  as a for profit business and publicly traded stock  this company s investors are still expecting profits  Instead  they are getting misleading non GAAP metrics that enable executives to earn large profits  Our call on Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   showed how dangerous it is to trust non GAAP earnings because they cannot be used to cover true cash costs  For these reasons and more  Blackbaud  NASDAQ BLKB  lands in the Danger Zone this week 
Revenue Growth Is Meaningless Without Profits
Over the past decade  Blackbaud has grown revenue at an impressive rate of 14  compounded annually  Despite strong revenue growth  Blackbaud s economic earnings  the true cash flows  have declined from  30 million in 2005 to   200 000 in 2015  as can be seen in Figure 1  See a reconciliation of Blackbaud s GAAP net income to economic earnings  
Figure 1 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The decline in economic earnings coincides with Blackbaud s return on invested capital  ROIC   Since 2007  Blackbaud s ROIC has declined from 123  to 7  over the last twelve months  What was once a highly profitable business is no longer  Blackbaud s numerous acquisitions over the years  including Convio  MicroEdge  Smart Tuition  and Everyday Hero  have been nothing but a drag on profits  despite the additional revenue brought in 
In addition to declining ROIC  which showcases Blackbaud s inefficient management of capital  the company s margins have been in a long term decline  Since 2005  BLKB s after tax profit  NOPAT  margins have declined from 18  to 7  over the last twelve months  as can be seen in Figure 2 
Figure 2 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Non GAAP Metrics Mislead Investors and Misalign Executive Incentives
The  have been made clear  yet companies still use them to  better represent business operations   How can a company better represent operations by removing a significant amount of operating costs  Below are the non GAAP metrics that Blackbaud uses 
Non GAAP revenue   adds back acquisition related deferred revenue write downs because  which essentially removes the GAAP requirement to write down acquired deferred revenue to fair value 
Non GAAP Operating Income  operating income that removes stock based compensation  amortization of intangibles  employee severances  acquisition related expenses  and restructuring costs among others 
Non GAAP Net Income   net income that removes the items listed above in non GAAP operating income in addition to the loss on sale of businesses and a tax adjustment related to non GAAP items 
In 2015  Blackbaud s non GAAP operating income was 161  higher than GAAP operating income  and its non GAAP net income was 171  higher than GAAP net income 
The use of non GAAP metrics has proliferated throughout the company s stated strategic goals  Blackbaud stated in 2014 as part of its five point growth strategy that it wanted to improve non GAAP operating margins by 3 6 percentage points by 2017  However  as Figure 2 shows  NOPAT margins have only worsened  Even worse  executives are incentivized through non GAAP metrics  an   and cover in more detail later in this report 
Low Profitability Threatens BLKB
Blackbaud operates in a niche market  one that focuses solely on nonprofit organizations  However  this niche market does not mean they are without competition  The declining trend in ROIC noted above does not bode well for the future  Blackbaud recognizes that it faces competition from software developers who provide customized nonprofit solutions  general customer relationship management developers like Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   and large international organizations like Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Oracle  NYSE ORCL   Each of these firms offers products for nonprofit companies  With a 7  ROIC  Blackbaud only bests CRM in terms of profitability  which is no great feat  as CRM has   Figure 3 has more details 
Figure 3 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Unprofitable Market Stymies Bull Hopes
As often is the case with software and cloud providers  bulls often tout scalability  recurring revenue  market share  or some other metric as reasons the company is poised to succeed  However  none of these metrics will matter if the market itself is unprofitable  Based on the data above  there is a clear trend that growing within the nonprofit sector has been detrimental to Blackbaud s business  Perhaps  there is a reason that Blackbaud is known as a leader in this niche market  as larger  more profitable competition has deemed its profitability prospects too low to devote time and resources 
Adding trouble to bull arguments  BLKB s current valuation implies the company will achieve revenue nearly 150  higher than the all current revenue from Blackbaud s stated addressable market  which the company estimates at  6 3 billion  Read below to see how the stock s current valuation implies BLKB will generate over  9 billion in revenue 
Acquisition Hopes Are Not Justification For Valuation
With Blackbaud operating in a niche market  and larger competitors possessing ample cash resources  it would seem likely that if a larger competitor wants to expand into this market  it would look to acquire BLKD or similar smaller competition  However  Blackbaud is not as attractive an acquisition target as many think 
First  Blackbaud has large  hidden  liabilities that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers would initially suggest 
 73 million in off balance sheet debt  3  of market cap 
 25 million in net deferred tax liabilities  1  of market cap 
After adjusting for these hidden liabilities  we can model a scenario in which Oracle purchases BLKD  something we would advise against per our  Nevertheless  modeling different scenarios allows us to show you just how expensive BLKB is 
Second  after we analyze how much the business might be worth to a potential suitor  we see that  even in the absolute best case scenario  the stock is worth less  not more  than where it trades today 
Figures 4 6 show the implied stock prices that Oracle should pay for BLKB to achieve different  Goal ROICs  assuming different levels of profit margins  There are limits on how much Oracle should pay to earn a proper return  given the NOPAT or cash flows being acquired  For each scenario  we show the max price Oracle can pay and still achieve the  goal ROICs  
Figure 4 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  See the underlying calculations   
The first  goal ROIC  is Oracle s WACC or 7   Figure 4 shows the acquisition stock prices implied by different margin levels for Blackbaud post acquisition  While we think it is highly unlikely that Blackbaud s business would ever earn the same high margin as Oracle s existing business  we include it in our analysis to show the best case scenario  At 7  ROIC  this deal would be  value neutral   as the ROIC earned on the deal would equal Oracle s weighted average cost of capital  WACC   Even in this  best case scenario   the most Oracle should pay is  52 share  16  downside  
Figure 5 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  See the underlying calculations   
Figure 5 shows the second  goal ROIC  of 19   which is the roughly ROIC implied by Oracle at  36 share  the price of the stock when we wrote our  Open Letter to Larry Ellison   In order to achieve a 19  ROIC  the most Oracle should pay is  12 share  and only if management is confident BLKB can immediately achieve Oracle s 28  NOPAT margin upon acquisition 
Figure 6 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  See the underlying calculations   
Figure 6 shows the last  goal ROIC  of 23   which is Oracle s current ROIC  Any deal that doesn t earn a return of 23  or above is bad for shareholders as it signals to the market that Oracle s ROIC will continue its decline  Assuming management no longer wants to drive down its ROIC  the most Oracle should pay for BLKB is  8 share  87  downside   This purchase price assumes BLKB can immediately achieve Oracle s 28  NOPAT margin  Any other margin scenario results in a negative implied stock price  which means  there is no positive value Oracle could pay  when including liabilities  that would earn a 23  ROIC 
In each of the scenarios above  there are implications to Oracle s stock price  If Oracle aims to earn a 19  ROIC  which is the current ROIC implied by  36 share  investors can expect the stock to settle around  36 share  However  if management completes an acquisition that only earns a 7  ROIC  ORCL investors should expect significant downside  For more information  see the model in our 
Organic Growth Can t Justify Valuation Either
To justify its current stock price   62 share  via organic growth  Blackbaud must grow NOPAT by 21  compounded annually for the next 15 years  To put this scenario into perspective  based on current margin estimates  the company would be generating  9 8 billion in revenue 15 years from now  which is slightly greater than MasterCard s  MA  fiscal 2016 revenue and  3 billion greater than salesforce com s fiscal 2015 revenue  It is also greater than the current addressable market   6 3 billion  
In a more realistic scenario  where Blackbaud can grow NOPAT by 11  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  11 share today   an 82  downside 
Failure to Reach  Goals  Could Sink BLKB
Blackbaud laid out its plan for growth in pretty clear terms  Any failure to reach these goals could result in shares falling back to reality  One caveat is that if management is able to continue misleading investors with non GAAP metrics  the moment of reckoning could take longer  Three of Blackbaud s keys to growth strategy are below 
Continue moving services to the cloud  Our Danger Zone reports our filled with software cloud companies  such as DemandWare  NYSE DWRE   Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK   and Marketo  NASDAQ MKTO   each of which lack profitability to reach scale or any competitive advantage  These stocks are down 45   29  and 35  since publishing our reports  BLKB does not want to follow in those footsteps 
Drive sales effectiveness  which we assume will be key to reversing the long term decline in economic earnings  The company cannot continue spending significant amounts  44  of revenue in 2015  on sales   marketing  research   development  and general   administrative costs if it plans to increase margins and return to profitability 
Increase non GAAP operating margin by 3 6 percentage points by 2017  Unfortunately  non GAAP margins fail to measure real cash flows and are easily manipulated  Any further decline in margins will only increase pressure on management to come up with  better ways to measure operational success  
Given the past decade of operational deterioration  it seems unlikely that BLKB can meet these goals and the high expectations baked into the stock price 
Insider Sales and Short Interest Remain Low
Over the past 12 months 486 000 shares have been purchased and 138 000 shares have been sold for a net effect of 348 000 insider shares purchased  These purchases represent  1  of shares outstanding  Additionally  there are 2 3 million shares sold short  or just over 5  of shares outstanding 
Executive Compensation Focuses On Wrong Metrics
Blackbaud executives receive annual cash bonuses and equity awards for meeting business performance goals  Cash bonuses are awarded for meeting  adjusted revenue  and  adjusted EBIT   which is another term for the company s non GAAP operating income  Executives are incentivized to grow revenue by any means  such as acquisition  and then can achieve performance goal  2 by removing common costs  such as acquisition costs  stock based compensation charges  and integration costs  Similarly  executives receive equity awards for achieving  adjusted revenue  and  adjusted EBIT as a percentage of adjusted revenue   Misaligned executive compensation poses significant risks to Blackbaud s investors  We would much prefer executive compensation be based upon ROIC  which has a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Blackbaud s 2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  29 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  16 million in non operating income  3  of revenue   We removed  22 million related to non operating expenses and  7 million related to non operating income 
Balance Sheet  we made  244 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  41 million  The most notable adjustment was  139 million  21  of net assets  related to midyear acquisitions 
Valuation  we made  507 million of adjustments that decreased shareholder value There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  The largest adjustment was the removal of  482 million  18  of market cap  in total debt  which includes  73 million in off balance sheet operating leases
