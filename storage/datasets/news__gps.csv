14084,235599,GPS,Guardant Health  Gap  GameStop  Microsoft And Sony Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 9  2019    Shares of Guardant Health   NASDAQ GH   as the Bull of the Day  Gap   NYSE GPS   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on GameStop   NYSE GME    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   and Sony   NYSE SNE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Guardant Healthis a  7 billion provider of diagnostic tests for early detection of cancer in high risk populations and recurrence monitoring in cancer survivors With sales expected to break above  200 million this year  representing over 125  annual growth  their commercially available tests provide information that helps advanced cancer patients get the right treatment and helps drug companies get new therapies to market faster Conquering Cancer with DataExamining cancer reappearance is widely expected to be a  15 billion market in the United States in the near term  while detecting patients with the risk of cancer is poised to be an  18 billion annual market Using specialized blood tests and liquid biopsy  examination of tissue  to detect cancer  Guardant has grown fast after launching the LUNAR DNA test for early detection  Along the spectrum  the company s Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI products have played a significant role in identifying late stage cancer The LUNAR assay is also used for research and for use in prospective clinical trials  including initial studies related to screening and early detection in asymptomatic individuals In pursuing what the company calls  precision oncology   Guardant has made a name for itself in matching cancer patients with customized treatments Q3 Earnings Inspire Analysts to Raise EstimatesOn November 7  Guardant reported a third quarter 2019 revenue of  60 8 million  an increase of 181  over the prior year period  The company also surprised investors with a quarterly loss of only 14 cents when the Street consensus was looking for a loss of 39 cents  thus delivering a 64  positive surprise Here were some of the highlights of the quarter as reported by the company     Reported 13 259 tests to clinical customers and 5 280 tests to biopharmaceutical customers in Q3  representing year over year increases of 89  and 111   Initiated ECLIPSE  a large scale registrational study designed to support the performance of the company s LUNAR 2 blood test in colorectal cancer screening in average risk adults  Submitted Premarket Approval Application package for Guardant360 to the U S  Food and Drug Administration  Launched CLIA version of the LUNAR Assay for use in prospective clinical trials During the quarter  the Guardant team continued to make significant progress across our business   said Helmy Eltoukhy  PhD  Chief Executive Officer   We are especially excited by the recent initiation of our ECLIPSE study  If successful  we believe this registrational study will pave the way for a blood based test to address the significant unmet need of physicians and their patients who seek an alternative to the current tools for colorectal cancer screening  After the 25 cent EPS surprise  Wall Street analysts raised their full year 2019 consensus by 39 cents from a loss of  1 27 to a loss of 88 cents They also boosted next year s outlook from a loss of  1 29 to a loss of  1 18  On the top line  Guardant is expected to grow revenues by 30  to  267 4 million Race to the Future of Preventive MedicineGenetic diagnostics is an exciting field full of innovative companies providing everything from full genome sequencing to specialized cancer tests  Not only are people everywhere becoming more curious about their genetic ancestry  they re also getting more proactive about their genetic predisposition for health issues A peer of Guardant s in the space is Invitae  the  1 7 billion provider of medical grade genetic testing whose sales are also expected to eclipse  200 million this year Challenges for these companies include making money when the cost of testing is coming down so quickly and making sure that insurance reimbursement is available  Invitae has a head start in this arena after being selected by UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  as one of only 7 key providers in their Preferred Lab Network  which includes the Mayo Clinic Plus  Invitae is creating a bigger brand footprint by offering many tests for free to those in need  In July  the company announced their Detect programs to provide no charge genetic testing for conditions in which testing is underutilized and can improve diagnosis and treatment According to Invitae  research has shown no charge testing programs result in earlier diagnosis and treatment  Enrollment was opened for Detect programs in four conditions  muscular dystrophy  prostate cancer  cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia and lysosomal storage diseases And in September  Invitae expanded the Detect program by announcing the availability of Detect Hereditary Pancreatic Cancer  a testing program that offers no charge genetic testing and counseling to patients with pancreatic cancer  Genetic testing is recommended by clinicians for all pancreatic cancer patients to guide treatment choices and evaluate eligibility for clinical trials While the Detect no charge programs are a net cost for the company  they create a wider data set for research in addition to fostering good will throughout public and medical communities In the neighborhood of innovation  Invitae announced in November the launch of Invitae Discover  a clinical research platform that leverages biometric data available through Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch to provide better understanding of the genetic causes of disease  The first study on the platform will evaluate genetics in cardiovascular disease and was announced in conjunction with the American Heart Association s Scientific Sessions where researchers are presenting data on genetic screening in familial hypercholesterolemia While Guardant is a unique leader in its specialties  Invitae may be the better buy right now with a sub  2 billion market cap  But both midcaps should remain on your radar if you want exposure to the exciting arena of genetic diagnostics Disclosure  I own NVTA shares for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio  Gap and its subsidiaries are another victim of the retail apocalypse  This firm is doing so poorly that it is spinning off its only growing brand Old Navy so that it doesn t sink with the rest of the ship  Gap is down roughly 37  so far this  underperforming the already dismal retail apparel sector  Analysts  pessimism continues towards this falling stock  pushing it into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  The BusinessGap Inc  includes Banana Republic  Gap  Athleta  and Old Navy  which is in the process of being spun off as its own company  This firm has had a very disappointing last year  with the past 4 quarters illustrating a topline decline  This most recent quarter demonstrated the worst Q3 profitability since 2012  as this firm falls into the depths of the retail apocalypse Even just looking at this company s investor relations page  you can tell that there are more significant issues with the company  Everything is disorganized and aesthetically displeasing  It isn t intuitive  and finding the most recent earnings press release took a hunt  This illustrates this firm s archaic practices that have led them to where they are today Every segment this last quarter declined year over year  margins are thinning  and everything is pointing to a dying company  Guidance was further lowered  and comparable sales are expected to be down in the mid single digits  This negative narrative is only going to decline further once the growing Old Navy is completely divested Management s sentiment was very negative  and the interim CEO Robert Fisher said   We are not pleased with the third quarter results   something you rarely see from a company head in an earning press release  This is a sign of major systemic issues within the company that I don t believe will be easily managed Robert Fisher just became Gaps interim CEO one month ago after Art Peck stepped down from his position following a very disappointing last 4 5 years in the job  The company has lost 59  of its value in the previous 5 years  and unless the business makes significant systemic changes to its operations  I fear that the firm will not stay afloat much longer Gap and Banana are higher end brands but have been forced to substantially discount their prices in order to get customers in the door  This has set a precedent in the market for these brands  and consumers will now only purchase them when they are severely discounted  This is cutting the firm s ability to profit Take AwayThis stock has been a falling knife for some time now  and the continued negative earnings justify its downward trajectory  I would stay away from these shares as they have fallen victim to the retail apocalypse Additional content GameStop  GME  Q3 Earnings Preview  Will the Free Fall Continue GameStop is set to report its third quarter report after the closing bell on Tuesday  December 10  GME stock has been in a freefall in 2019 and investors have sold the stock into one of its lowest valuations in the past 10 years at around 6 9X its forward earnings  which is well below the industry average of 13 5X forward earnings Wall Street has largely dumped the stock because digital marketplaces have started to displace the brick and mortar chain  GameStop s upcoming Q3 report will dictate the momentum the company brings into the holiday season  which it desperately needs to capitalize on Financial Declines Steepen Expectations for the video game retailer were already low going into its past second quarter report  but the company s Q2 performance still managed to surprise some  after sales dropped 14 3  Weakened demand across the retailer s hardware and software offerings  including its pre owned games segment  caused the downturn  The declines in demand in its pre owned games is especially detrimental to GameStop as it is its most profitable segment  Comparable store sales fell 11 3  in the second quarter as well To make matter worse  GameStop CFO James Bell stated  We expect a percentage decline of comparable same store sales for 2019 to be in the low teens  which includes a difficult comparable sales challenge from last year  The consumer shift towards the online marketplace for video games is a big factor in the decline  But the decline in hardware sales is largely due to the upcoming release of next generation consoles Microsoft and Sony confirmed the timeline of their newest game consoles earlier this year  which is set for the 2020 holiday season  GameStop management said that the announcement came earlier than expected and has caused a pullback in video game and console purchases as consumers await the next generation of gaming Outlook  As part of its turnaround plan  GameStop actively cut its costs in the latter half of Q2 and saw its expenses drop by 4  in the quarter Management is now ramping up its cost cutting efforts through a wide variety of moves that includes reducing inventory  closing underperforming stores  and revamping the digital sales channel  GameStop executives forecast the expense managing initiatives will improve the firm s margins despite the sales declines GameStop management has also tried to slash debt  bolster its gross profit margin  and decrease its capital spending  Plus  the firm plans to reduce its sales footprint  especially in markets that have more than one GameStop location  It also plans to refresh its inventory so it can focus on higher margin items like accessories and collectibles Our Q3 consensus estimates call for earnings to plunge over 91  to  0 06 per share and for net sales to fall 22 6  to  1 61 billion  US sales are projected to drop 20 2  to about  1 billion and comparable store sales are anticipated to decline 12 8  Q4 will be a pivotal quarter for GameStop as the holiday season will be included in the report  Our Q4 estimates forecast sales to come in at  2 8 billion for an 8 62  drop and for earnings to slip 3 45  to  1 40 per share Looking ahead to the next fiscal year  estimates predict GameStop s sales will decline only another 2 8   However  its bottom line is projected to tumble 18 18  to  0 90 per share Bottom Line GameStop s stock has been pummeled because the company has not convinced investors how it will address the ongoing consumer shift to buying video games digitally  While management has employed some aggressive restructuring plans that have seen some success  GameStop doesn t seem poised to grow anytime soon GameStop has had its earnings estimates revised lower across the board  helping earn the stock a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Breakout Biotech

14691,236206,GPS,Stock Market Continues its March Higher Despite Mixed Signals on China Trade Deal,opinion," Tuesday Market Open  The ongoing U S  China trade deal saga seems like one of those daytime soap operas  Missed a few episodes  No worries  you can get right back into the story line  The back and forth headlines on the tariff situation between the world s two largest economies and the seesaw effect on the stock market continued yesterday 
Wall Street seemed to be continuing to search for clarity on the tariff situation  The three major U S  indices notched slight gains Monday after erasing losses  but the trading didn t feel like it had a lot of conviction behind it 
Here s a brief play by play  
It had looked like stocks might open in the green on optimism from a Chinese state media report that the two sides held a  constructive  phone call over the weekend  
But then equity index futures reversed course after a CNBC report  citing a Chinese government source  said Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal amid President Trump s reluctance to scale back tariffs  That left stocks to open lower 
They were then able to erase those losses  helped by news that the U S  Commerce Department has granted an extension allowing U S  companies to continue doing business with Huawei Technologies  a U S  blacklisted Chinese company whose status has been an issue in the trade negotiations between the two nations  
Whiplash anyone 
With the day to day market playbook so closely attuned to every ebb and flow in the trade dispute news cycle  the ups and downs can be welcome for short term traders but a bit irritating for many long term investors  Depending on your portfolio time horizon  sometimes it can be a good idea to tune the noise out  
Optimism from the Huawei development seems to be bleeding over into this morning s trading  helping investors shrug off some mixed news from the retail space 
Retail EarningsInvestors got a snapshot of the retail sector this morning as Kohl s  NYSE KSS   TJX  NYSE TJX   and  Home Depot   NYSE HD  reported earnings  While two of the companies focus on clothing retailing  HD can also be viewed as a barometer on the health of the consumer because many people might only shell out for DIY home renovations when they re feeling good about their financial prospects  Shares of KSS were getting taken out to the woodshed this morning down about 13  after the retailer reported lower than expected earnings  revenue  and same store sales growth  The company also lowered its earnings per share guidance for this year  Shares of HD were also getting hammered in the pre market down about 4  on mixed results  Though HD beat earnings consensus by a penny  revenue fell short of consensus  Plus  the outlook from HD wasn t stellar as the company reduced its sales growth forecast for 2019 TJX looked to be the bright spot of the bunch  Shares  which were down 1  ahead of its release  flipped to the upside as the company reported a 4  increase in same store sales  TJX earnings came in at 68 cents per share  a couple cents above consensus     The growth forecasts from HD and KSS might not bode well for the upcoming holiday shopping season  but the results come after last week s slightly better than expected retail sales figures  October retail sales showed a 0 3  gain  compared to a Briefing com consensus that had expected a 0 2  rise  The growth in discretionary spending  especially after the prior month s contraction seems to be a welcome sign ahead of the holiday shopping season  which many retailers rely upon for a good chunk of their revenue Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  is expected to report after the close today  and other retailers expected to open their books later in the week include Lowe s  NYSE LOW    Target   NYSE TGT   L Brands  NYSE LB   Macy s  NYSE M   Gap  NYSE GPS   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   and  Foot Locker   NYSE FL  Stocks Rise  But So Does Gold
Overall  there remains little selling pressure in the market  Perhaps some people don t want to miss out on all of these all time highs we ve been hitting  adding to a bump from the Fed s softer monetary policy and better than forecast earnings 
But it may be a good time to remember that much of this record rally has hinged on the thinking that a partial trade deal could get inked sometime soon  We haven t seen one yet 
Also  investors seem to be injecting some caution into the market  Despite the upward move in stocks Monday  three indicators of risk all finished the day higher as well  Investors sought the safe haven allure of gold  pushing prices higher  see chart below   They also bought another safe haven investment  U S  government debt  sending Treasury yields lower  Meanwhile  Wall Street s main fear gauge  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   ticked up

CHART OF THE DAY  GOLD GETTING A SHINE  In recent months and much of the time in general gold futures   GC   candlestick  move inversely to equity indices such as the S P 500 Index  SPX   purple line   as many investors view gold as a safe haven investment  Yesterday  however  both gold and stocks moved higher  Investors were apparently slightly rattled by a report suggesting Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal  news that also sparked buying in U S  government debt  Data sources  CME Group  NASDAQ CME   S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Poorer Profit Potential  Even though the stock market is at record highs  earnings estimates for this year and next have been slipping  seemingly because of the continued drag from the U S  China trade war  According to investment research firm CFRA  the S P 500 was recently forecast to earn  162 12 a share this year  down from  171 93 projected at the start of this year  Earnings per share are expected to hit  176 88 by the end of next year  down from an initial forecast of  191 23   Until details of the deal are revealed  along with the prospects for continued conversations  EPS estimates are likely to undershoot potential   according to Sam Stovall  chief investment strategist with CFRA  
Slowdown in Dividend Growth  Even as profit estimates have been slipping  global dividend growth is also under pressure as the global economy softens  Although global payouts rose 2 8  to a new third quarter record of  355 3 billion  that was below the 4 4  pace of Q3 2018  according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index  The slowdown was sharp in North America  where dividends rose 4 3  in Q3  down from 8 6  in the prior year period  Meanwhile  a growing proportion of U S  companies kept their dividends flat   We have been cautioning investors all year that the rapid dividend growth they have enjoyed in the last couple of years was set to return to more normal levels   according to Jane Shoemake  investment director of global equity income at Janus Henderson Investors   For next year  slower profit growth will impact dividends  but with interest rates at their current low levels  equities will continue to provide a valuable source of income for investors  even if the rate of dividend growth is less eye catching than in the recent past  
Confidence Building  This week is relatively light on data  but it is peppered with housing related numbers  In addition to the HD results and housing starts and building permits figures from this morning  this week also holds LOW earnings  a weekly mortgage applications index  and data on existing home sales  Next week  we re scheduled to get a reading on new home sales for October  Fresh figures from the new home front this week have been encouraging  Although the National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index ticked down one point in November  the 70 mark for the latest number stands with October s figure of 71 as the highest sentiment levels this year  Low mortgage rates and continued job growth are helping boost builder confidence in the market for new homes  the NAHB said Monday

14708,236223,GPS,Investors Embracing Caution Again  Some Hints Appear  But Market Looks Resilient,opinion," Thursday Market Open  Are the  three horsemen of risk  ready to ride again as trade worries push the market around 
It looks like a  definite maybe  after a report from Reuters Wednesday that the  Phase One  trade deal might get delayed to next year  Volatility  bonds  and gold three investments people often embrace when they re trying to lower their risk profile all moved higher in the minutes after that negative news  but none really got much traction  Gold actually ended the day lower  And the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   eased back from intraday highs above 13 by the close of Wednesday s stock market session 
Stocks initially crumbled on the trade news  with the S P 500  SPX  falling back below 3100  However  stocks did appear to find some support at the lows and climbed back above the psychological 3100 mark  The SPX s ability to rebound from its weakest level of the day and claw its way up to 3100 again could be a positive technical sign that flows into today s trading  but we ll have to wait and see 
The fact that stocks showed resilience and most of the main risk horsemen got reined in might be evidence that investors continue to see the trade situation for what it is  A noisy distraction from what s been a much better than expected earnings season and from continued health among consumers  That s not to say trade isn t important it s arguably the biggest issue out there  But people are starting to get used to these interruptions and might be taking them more in stride  It s probably no use getting too hot or cold on any daily tariff headlines until pen hits paper on an agreement 
On the tariff front  there was some positive news early Thursday as Dow Jones Newswires reported a chance for possible meetings between U S  and Chinese negotiators in Beijing before Thanksgiving next week  Turkey and stuffing in China  anyone 
Despite the late revival  yesterday was a tough day for many of the trade sensitive sectors  including Materials  Technology  and Industrials  Also  the Financial sector has been wrestling this week with a flattening yield curve  That continued Wednesday as trade concerns kept weighing on the benchmark 10 year yield  helping push it down to 1 73   That s nearly 23 basis points below the month s high  and the lowest level in about two weeks  That s still about 16 basis points above the two year and three month yields  so a quick return to the inverted curve seen earlier this year doesn t appear imminent 
Retail Earnings Haven t Checked Out YetOn the earnings circuit  we re far from done with retail results  JW Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  and Gap  NYSE GPS  both step to the plate after today s close  and Foot Locker  NYSE FL  is scheduled to open its books before the open Friday Macy s  NYSE M  became the latest retailer to report early Thursday  and investors didn t seem to like what they saw  Shares fell 6  in pre market trading after the company posted a same store sales decline and missed analysts  revenue expectations  In a press release  M said sales were hurt by the late arrival of cold weather  continued soft international tourism and weaker than anticipated performance in lower tier malls  The disappointing report followed weak results from Kohl s  NYSE KSS  earlier this week  so it s been tough going for department stores lately It s been a mixed week on the retail earnings front  Target  NYSE TGT  and Lowe s  NYSE LOW  both looked solid yesterday  but  Home Depot   NYSE HD  disappointed the day before  TGT shares rose an astonishing 14  Wednesday  one of the best days for any major stock all year and a signal that investors appear eager to award retailers who succeed in this environment  That s an interesting change from say  a year ago  when many investors seemed to yawn at good news but quickly punish bad news on earnings TJX  NYSE TJX  also beat analysts  estimates and saw strong same store sales growth  Importantly  the company said its holiday quarter is off to a strong start  It s the current quarter that a lot of people are likely going to focus on more than the last when it comes to retailers  with holiday season now well underway and Black Friday coming right up There s still some data coming at the market before the week wraps up  Front and center early Thursday were weekly jobless claims coming in at 227 000  That was 8 000 above consensus and the same as last week s upwardly revised number  Consider keeping an eye on this metric in weeks to come  because it s starting to tick higher University of Michigan November sentiment tomorrow also stands out as a possible attention getter  Existing home sales and leading indicators later this morning could also be worth a look  Last time out  in September  existing home sales fell sequentially but still rose from a year earlier  Home prices just keep zooming higher  which is making it tougher for first time buyers to get into the market Speaking of higher  that s where crude went Wednesday  Inventories rose in the U S   as many analysts had expected  but the futures market executed a little snapback  It might have reflected some people getting back into the market after the bad news passed Fed Seems Poised To Stay Right Where It Is
In the  no surprises  department  Fed minutes released Wednesday showed no one on the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  itching to lower rates any further at this point  That backs up what some analysts have been saying about the Fed wanting to step back and watch for a while to see if the 75 basis point lowering since July starts to reverberate around the economy  As seasoned investors probably know  these rate cuts can take time to have an impact  
On the other hand  there s a school of thought that suggests no amount of rate cuts can have much effect on business spending until companies have a playbook on how to approach trade with China  A couple of Fed speakers take the podium later today  so perhaps that s something to consider being on the lookout for  
The futures market suggests there s still about 50  odds that rates by mid 2020 will be right where they are now  and even a year out there s a pretty good chance for rates at current levels  Later in December we ll get the Fed s updated  dot plot  showing where FOMC officials expect rates to go in the next year or two  and that might be interesting to check for any signs of views getting more hawkish

CHART OF THE DAY  OUT SOXED  FAANGs   NYFANG IFUS candlestick  are keeping pace with the Nasdaq  COMP purple line  so far this year  but semiconductor stocks  SOX blue line  are way ahead of both  That said  few sectors arguably are as prone to trade related ups and downs as the chips  Data Sources  Philadelphia Stock Exchange  Nasdaq  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Yield Signs  Earlier this year  so called  defensive  sectors like Utilities  Staples  and Real Estate surged as Treasury yields came under pressure  Then the situation reversed and yields started climbing this fall  weighing on those same sectors  Could we be heading for another plot twist in this long running story  Over the last two weeks  the 10 year Treasury yield has fallen from a three month high near 1 96  down to below 1 75   When yields fall  that sometimes makes defensive sectors  which are often referred to as  bond proxies   look more attractive to certain investors seeking dividends in a low yield environment  Last week  the average S P 500 dividend yield was about even with the 10 year Treasury yield  Now the Treasury yield is below the average dividend yield  If Treasury yields keep dropping  it might be interesting to see if Staples  Utilities  and Real Estate start getting bids  A lot of it could hinge on the next moves in the trade war  because recent pressure on Treasury yields stems in part from worries a deal might not be inked in the near future 
Small Packages  Speaking of trade  some analysts see small cap stocks as one way to track market sentiment on the tariff negotiations  Because small cap companies tend to do more of their business here in the U S  and don t sell as much abroad  the thinking goes  they might have a better chance to stay healthy if the trade situation worsens  That thinking seems dominant recently  at least judging by the performance of the Russell 2000 Index  RUT   which tracks small cap companies and has a heavy weighting toward regional bank stocks 
Until recently  the RUT was getting outmatched as large cap indices like the S P 500  SPX  and Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  scored new all time highs even as the RUT languished well below last year s peaks  Over the last month  the RUT is up 4   and it outpaced some of the other indices this week as trade worries burdened some of the big multinational stocks  Still  RUT seems to be having a hard time getting past long term resistance at the 1600 level  That s a mark it hasn t spent much time above since mid 2018  We ll have to wait and see if eventually buyers start putting more faith in the small guy 
Chips vs  FAANGs  Despite everything you might hear about how FAANGS have left the building in 2019  they re actually doing a pretty decent job keeping pace with the broader Nasdaq  COMP  so far this year  see Fig  1 above   As of midday Wednesday  the Nasdaq was up 28 4  and FAANGS were up 27 3  since the end of 2018  Not a bad performance by either  but that doesn t hold a candle to the 2019 darling of the market  Semiconductors  That sector is up more than 48  year to date  led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   Micron  NASDAQ MU   and Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA   Earnings are in the rear view mirror for most of the chip sector  but MU is expected to open its books in mid December  something we ll discuss in more detail as it gets closer  
The thing to remember is that while the chip sector has seen some mixed earnings numbers over the last quarter  it also holds onto a lot of investor optimism about consumer demand  Those chips go into all kinds of devices  including  probably  the one you re reading this on  If the global economy takes a turn for the worse or trade talks break down  chips might be the first to feel it  That certainly was the case back in May when trade negotiations withered and the chip sector took a dive  Chips are an exciting sector  but probably not one for the meek

Management lowered its sales and comparable sales  comps  view for fiscal 2019  Nevertheless  it reaffirmed the outlook for adjusted earnings per share Q3 HighlightsIn the fiscal third quarter  Gap s adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents  However  the bottom line declined 23 2  from 69 cents registered a year ago  On a reported basis  the company delivered earnings of 37 cents per share The Gap  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Net sales dipped 2 2  year over year to  3 998 million but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 951 million  Foreign currency translations negatively impacted the top line by  12 million  Total comps declined 4  compared with flat results in the year ago period Comps were impacted by declines across all three brands mainly due to soft traffic trends  Notably  comps declined 4  at Old Navy versus 4  improvement in the prior year quarter  At Banana Republic and Gap brands  comps declined 3  and 7   respectively  In the year ago quarter  comps rose 2  at Banana Republic and declined 7  at the company s namesake brand Comps decline in Old Navy can be attributed to continued challenges in product acceptance as well as weak traffic  Meanwhile  the Banana Republic brand was mainly affected by softness in some products due to the warmer than expected weather along with sub optimal mix regarding sizes  owing to efforts to fully implement a new inventory management tool  Though the Gap brand reported comps decline  sales trends were positive due to traffic improvement across all channels on continued improvement in customer response to products  MarginsAdjusted gross profit in the quarter under review dropped 3 9  to  1 560 million and gross margin contracted 70 basis points  bps  to 39   The decline  however  reflected an improvement from the trend witnessed in the first half  Gross margin gained from improvement at the Gap brand  owing to margin expansion in all major product divisions and positive global average unit retail  AUR   This was offset by softness in the Old Navy brand Further  merchandise margin contracted 50 bps mainly due to Old Navy and Banana Republic  somewhat mitigated by Gap and Athleta brands  Meanwhile  rent and occupancy increased 20 bps due to lower sales  Adjusted SG A expenses expanded 70 bps on lower sales as well as higher technology related investments Consequently  adjusted operating income declined 17 6  to  299 million  with

stockholders  equity of  3 634 million During the first nine months of fiscal 2019  the company generated net cash flow from operations of  528 million and incurred capital expenditure of  523 million  As of Nov 2  2019  Gap had free cash flow of  5 million due to higher capital spending Coming to the shareholder friendly moves  the company bought back 2 9 million shares for approximately  50 million and paid out a dividend of 24 25 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter  Furthermore  it announced a dividend payout of 24 25 cents per share for fourth quarter fiscal 2019 For fiscal 2019  management projects capital expenditure of  835 million  including base capital of  575 million for investment in profitable Old Navy and Athleta brands as well as in technology and supply chain initiatives  It anticipates capital expenditure to comprise  100 million of expansion charges related to its headquarters building and the development of distribution facility in Ohio  and  160 million of separation related capital spending In fourth quarter fiscal 2019  management expects to buy back shared worth of  50 million Store UpdateIn the first nine months of fiscal 2019  the company opened 85 Old Navy and Athleta stores  on a net basis  and acquired 140 Janie and Jack stores from Gymboree  Inc  Meanwhile  it closed 21 Gap brand stores primarily in North America  net of openings that mainly occurred in Asia Gap ended the fiscal third quarter with 3 938 outlets in 44 countries  out of which 3 396 were company operated and 542 were franchise outlets For fiscal 2019  the company now expects the closure of 15 company operated stores  net of openings and repositions  The projection also includes the closure of 130 stores related to the restructuring of the Gap brand fleet  Most of these store closures are expected to occur in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  Simultaneously  it remains committed toward store openings for Athleta  Old Navy and Gap China locations However  the company decided on Old Navy s exit from China in early 2020 to direct investments toward other high return opportunities like expanding digital capabilities and investing in the underpenetrated North America markets that provide better opportunities OutlookFor fiscal 2019  management cut sales and comps guidance  owing to continued troubles at its brands and soft traffic trends  However  it reiterated the view for earnings per share The company now anticipates comps decline in mid single digits compared with low single digit decline mentioned earlier  Moreover  it now expects net sales decline in low single digits versus flat year over year sales stated previously Gap expects effective tax rate of 31   Excluding adjustments to fiscal 2017 tax liability under TCJA and certain non cash tax impacts with respect to anticipated restructuring charges  the company continues to anticipate adjusted effective tax rate of 26  Nonetheless  Gap envisions fiscal 2019 GAAP

14711,236226,GPS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Samsung  Target And Davita,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  November 26  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Samsung   OTC SSNLF    Target   NYSE TGT   and Davita   NYSE DVA   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog A Holiday Shortened Global Week AheadThis is going to be a short trading week in the USA I don t see much in the way of market moving events Here are Reuters  latest five world market themes  reordered into relative importance for equity traders This week  I made no changes  1  Trade Headwinds Are BuildingCan we have it both ways  For two decades  trade expansion has fueled rapid global economic growth  But with trade volumes contracting at a rate of more than 1  year on year and the Sino U S trade war nearing its two year anniversary  world growth will plumb decade lows next year  the Organization for Economic Co Operation and Development predicts As a Dec  15 deadline for U S  tariff hikes approaches  Beijing has reportedly invited top U S  negotiators to talks  But it might call those off if President Trump signs into law a bill supporting Hong Kong s pro democracy protesters  or if U S  warships keep sailing near islands it claims in the South China Sea Growth has slowed to 30 year lows in China  U S  new factory orders and shipments have slowed  while monthly job creation is running a quarter below last year s levels   even after three interest rate cutOminously  the U S  bond curve is flattening again  Ten year U S  government borrowing costs are 15 basis points away from tumbling below two year yields  the so called curve inversion witnessed a few months ago  A sustained inversion is a reliable predictor of recession  and more trade tensions could well take us there  2  Will  Black Friday  Deliver for U S  Retailers U S  retailers launch annual Black Friday sales on Nov 29  ushering in the high stakes holiday shopping season for store chains that are struggling to adapt to shrinking mall traffic The seismic shift in the consumer landscape has exposed a growing divide between retailers capable of adapting their bricks and mortar stores to the online world  and others struggling to keep customers coming through their doors Recent quarterly reports illustrate that gulf  Shares in Target  for instance  surged to record highs after it raised full year earnings forecasts  but department stores Macy s and Kohl s cut their outlooks ahead of the holiday season  Macy s shares extended their losses for 2019 to 50   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   and Kohl s shares are all down by more than 25  this year But even with so many store chains struggling  U S  retail stocks haven t done too badly  The S P 500 Retailing index is up 21  for the year  not far behind the S P 500 s 24   And investors betting on Amazon s domination of the industry have been burned  An ETF called ProShares Decline of the Retail Store shorts a basket of brick and mortar store chains and has lost 3  this year  3  Fresh Eurozone Inflation Readings on the WayFlash readings of Eurozone inflation due on Nov 29 will surely top new ECB chief Christine Lagarde s must watch list  Price growth in the bloc has undershot the ECB s near 2  inflation target since 2013 and is not expected to approach that level any time soon  let alone this month On the bright side  predictions are for annual inflation to have edged up in November for the bloc and in Germany  Lagarde has also pledged to review the ECB s inflation strategy  following in the footsteps of the U S  Federal Reserve The problem is that many of the factors depressing prices are outside the ECB s control   demographics for instance  or the reliance on exports  in particular by German manufacturers   which leaves it exposed to the effects of a global trade war  Indeed  inflation expectations in the bloc closely track sentiment towards the U S  China trade spat this year  4  South Korea Feels U S  China Trade War ChillSouth Korea  a bellwether of risk in Asia  is digging into its coffers to get out of an economic rut  With Korean exporters hit hard by the Sino U S  trade war and declining global demand for their chips and ships  the government may be about to clear another massive spending increase for 2020 South Korean blue chips such as Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  have done well  but the broader equity index has trailed peers over the past 2 1 2 years  Economic growth is at its weakest in a decade and Korean workers have increasingly taken to the streets to protest job losses What Korea s vaunted tech industry needed was at least some sign of truce in the 16 month old trade spat  Without that business sentiment indicators  due in coming days  are unlikely to show improvement  The Bank of Korea has already cut interest rates twice this year but is unlikely to do so again at its Nov  29 meeting as it waits to see what steps the government plans  5  Brazil s Real SlumpsBrazil s currency unit  the real  has slumped towards record lows against the dollar   the latest South American currency to take a beating in recent weeks  It s down almost 8  this month  only the Chilean peso has performed worse But unlike its regional peers Argentina and Chile  Brazil hasn t undergone a radical government change recently or suffered a spate of social unrest  What s weighing on markets is this month s  mega  oil auction  which failed to attract foreign demand   and the billions of dollars   many had banked on The currency selloff has so far been orderly  volatility remains low and liquidity has not dried up  Nor is central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto sounding any alarms bells  saying currency market intervention was an option only if there was a lack of liquidity He may not need to worry  either  about inflation  at 2 54   it s running well below this year s 4 25  target  Thursday will bring a fresh batch of inflation data  which may show if the tumble in the real currency may impact inflation and Campos Neto s strategy Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks Samsung  This is the major electronics stock in SouthKorea  I see a Zacks

14712,236227,GPS,Gap  GPS  Down 12  In 6 Months  Can Efforts Aid Turnaround ,opinion,The Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS   stock has been suffering owing to dismal comparable sales  comps  trend in the past few quarters  Investor sentiment for the stock was further hurt by third quarter fiscal 2019 results  which were impacted by persistent soft performance across all brands as well as weak traffic trends  Also  strained margins and higher expenses remain  added concerns  Further  management cut sales and comps guidance A glimpse at this stock s price performance reveals that it has underperformed the industry in the past six months  Shares of this San Francisco  CA based company have lost approximately 12   wider than the  s 6 2  decline Moreover  unimpressive estimate revision trend for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 is a concern  Over the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved down by 48 5  and 16  for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019  respectively  to 34 cents and  1 73 Reasons for Gap s DistressIn third quarter fiscal 2019  total comps declined 4  compared with flat numbers in the year ago period  Comps were impacted by declines across all three brands mainly due to soft traffic trends  Comps declined 4  at Old Navy  3  at Banana Republic and 7  at the Gap brand  Old Navy s comps were affected by continued challenges in product acceptance as well as weak traffic  The Banana Republic brand was impacted by softness in some products due to warmer than expected weather along with sub optimal mix regarding sizes  owing to its efforts to fully implement a new inventory management tool  Gap brand reported comps decline due to store closures Also  adverse foreign currency translations weighed on its sales  which dipped 2 2  in the fiscal third quarter  In addition  adjusted gross margin contracted 70 basis points  bps   due to softness in the Old Navy brand  Merchandise margin contracted 50 bps mainly owing to softness in Old Navy and Banana Republic  somewhat mitigated by Gap and Athleta brands  Adjusted SG A expenses expanded 70 bps on lower sales as well as higher technology related investments  Consequently  adjusted operating margin declined 140 bps The company expects gross margin to deleverage in fiscal 2019  The company now anticipates comps decline in mid single digits compared with low single digit decline mentioned earlier  Moreover  it now expects net sales decline in low single digits versus flat year over year sales stated previously Can Efforts Aid Revival Gap is on track to spin off into two stand alone public companies  new Gap Inc  and Old Navy  The transaction is expected to close in 2020  The rationale behind the separation mainly includes improved focus  better cost and efficiency  and enhanced profitability  The focus from separation will help the two companies better serve their distinct customer sets  each with an operating model tailored to their respective business needs  It will also serve as a catalyst in improving costs and efficiency as the companies rebuild the organization structures and operating models  Moreover  it will empower both the companies to deliver sustained profitability Apart from this  management remains on track to revitalize the Gap brand by streamlining its specialty fleet and enhancing the marketing model to drive customer engagement  The company is also focused on driving profitability through improved product assortment and inventory composition as well as reduced promotional activity  Though it has a long way to go before restoring the brand to profitability  results in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were relatively better  The company witnessed positive margins and traffic trends for the Gap brand in the third quarter  owing to its efforts to drive profitability through improved product assortment and inventory composition as well as reduced promotions We believe that these efforts will take time to yield favorable results

14713,236228,GPS,Stocks   ETFs To Profit From Cyber Monday Deals,opinion,The holiday season has started  and the burst of online deals has been paying off retailers  This is especially true as online

14714,236229,GPS,Target  Gap  Beyond Meat  McDonald s And Costco Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 6  2019    Target   NYSE TGT   as the Bull of the Day  Gap   NYSE GPS   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND    McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Costco   NASDAQ COST   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks                          Target has been a star in the struggling retail space this year  with gains of over 88  since the beginning of the year  The company has continued to beat analysts  growing expectations  and the stock price keeps hitting new highs with its unending rally  Analysts continue to raise EPS estimates for TGT  propelling this stock into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Surviving the Retail ApocalypseThe  retail apocalypse  driven by online retail giant Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN    has been taking out brick and mortar storefronts across the US with more than 9 300 retail stores closing their doors in 2019  There has been a shift in the retail space  and only a few brick and mortar retail niches have been able to survive Millennials are changing the landscape in which businesses operate  with Silicon Valley leading the charge  Our world is becoming centered on the interconnected digital network we call the internet  The internet was built to hold and share data  making the transfer of data timely and seamless  Today the internet is allowing for a timely and seamless transfer of goods We  as millennials have grown up to recognize the importance of both convenience and value as standards of living  Target is able to hit both of those qualities  It s easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing floor plan combined with its discount products  not to mention its prolifically expanding online presence  7 5  of total Q3 revenue  As the rest of the retail is close more and more of their brick and mortar stores  Target has been able to able to grow its store count  Its digital channel grew its sales by 31  this past quarter  which is on top of 49  growth a year prior Despite TGT s massive run up this year  it is still trading at discounted multiples to its industry  though compared to the stock 5 year forward P E trend  it is trading at the highest end  Target s quickly growing omnichannel offering is expected to improve the company s topline while expanding margins  which would push its valuation further  I may wait for a pullback before putting on a sizable position Not only is TGT driving investor with significant share price returns but is yielding an over 2  dividend that investors can fall back on  The stock also has a  55 beta because of its discount quality  which means that it will create a slight hedge for your portfolio Take AwayTarget is a safe investment with a sound product offering that attracts Millennials and Gen Zs  which makes it a robust long term investment  especially factoring in the 2 12  dividend  I may wait for a small pullback in share price before putting on any substantial position  considering the blazing rally this stock has had this year  Gap and its subsidiaries are another victim of the retail apocalypse  This firm is doing so poorly that it is spinning off its only growing brand Old Navy so that it doesn t sink with the rest of the ship  Gap is down roughly 37  so far this  underperforming the already dismal retail apparel sector  Analysts  pessimism continues towards this falling stock  pushing it into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  The BusinessGap Inc  includes Banana Republic  Gap  Athleta  and Old Navy  which is in the process of being spun off as its own company  This firm has had a very disappointing last year  with the past 4 quarters illustrating a topline decline  This most recent quarter demonstrated the worst Q3 profitability since 2012  as this firm falls into the depths of the retail apocalypse Even just looking at this company s investor relations page  you can tell that there are more significant issues with the company  Everything is disorganized and aesthetically displeasing  It isn t intuitive  and finding the most recent earnings press release took a hunt  This illustrates this firm s archaic practices that have led them to where they are today Every segment this last quarter declined year over year  margins are thinning  and everything is pointing to a dying company  Guidance was further lowered  and comparable sales are expected to be down in the mid single digits  This negative narrative is only going to decline further once the growing Old Navy is completely divested Management s sentiment was very negative  and the interim CEO Robert Fisher said   We are not pleased with the third quarter results   something you rarely see from a company head in an earning press release  This is a sign of major systemic issues within the company that I don t believe will be easily managed Robert Fisher just became Gaps interim CEO one month ago after Art Peck stepped down from his position following a very disappointing last 4 5 years in the job  The company has lost 59  of its value in the previous 5 years  and unless the business makes significant systemic changes to its operations  I fear that the firm will not stay afloat much longer Gap and Banana are higher end brands but have been forced to substantially discount their prices in order to get customers in the door  This has set a precedent in the market for these brands  and consumers will now only purchase them when they are severely discounted  This is cutting the firm s ability to profit Take AwayThis stock has been a falling knife for some time now  and the continued negative earnings justify its downward trajectory  I would stay away from these shares as they have fallen victim to the retail apocalypse Additional content Beyond Meat Strikes Costco Deal  Should Investors Buy BYND Stock Beyond Meat announced Thursday that its plant based burger patties would appear in select Costco stores  The move from the young company comes as competition for retail shelf space intensifies against rival plant based meat producer  Impossible Foods and others Beyond Meat said that its popular Beyond Burgers will be sold at Costco stores in states including Texas  Florida  and New York for  14 99 per eight patty pack BYNDBeyond Meat has been one of the most prolific IPOs of 2019 and currently sits around  72 37 per share  which represents around a 189  return  BYND stock at one point rose over 858  to trade at  239 71 per share  The company s miraculous run brought a massive amount of attention to the stock  but  with it  came many doubts about the run s sustainability Beyond Meat s stock pulled back recently  so is its Costco announcement enough for investors to hop back on the BYND bandwagon Competition and SustainabilityAs Beyond Meat s stock began to soar to incredible heights  Wall Street began to question if the run was warranted  given the unknown scale of the plant based food market and rising competition in the space The Good Foods Institute  a Nonprofit organization  calculated that the plant based food market is now worth almost  4 5 billion in the U S  and has grown around 11  in just the last year  Plant based meat itself grew 10  last year  which was down from the 25  growth it saw in the previous year However  industry analysts from Markets and Markets still project that the plant based meat industry will grow internationally from  12 1 billion in 2019 to a  27 9 billion market by 2025 Plant based milk products bring in around  1 86 billion in domestic sales and are the definitive leader in the plant based food market  The plant based milk products now hold a 13  market share in the overall retail milk market thanks to the 61  growth it saw from 2012 to 2017 Some bullish Beyond Meat investors hope that plant based meat products can follow the same trajectory  The plant based meat industry brings in about  801 million in the US yearly  which could give the product a long growth runway Moving ForwardThe plant based meat industry looks poised to continue its growth and Beyond Meat will have to distinguish its products as larger companies set their sights on the emerging market  Beyond Meat s partnerships with McDonald s and others are a step in the right direction Procuring more restaurant and retail partnerships is vital for Beyond Meat  The restaurant partnerships will be especially crucial as it will help establish Beyond Meat s brand awareness  which will become paramount as more meatless products hit retail shelves Our fiscal 2019 estimates call for sales to soar over 213  to reach  275 28 million  Meanwhile  the company is projected to report an adjusted loss of  0 20 per share Looking ahead to the next fiscal year  our estimates project sales to climb 65 7  to hit  456 23 million  And BYND is expected to jump from a full year loss to positive earnings of   0 39 per share TakeawayBeyond Meat s remarkable run has captivated Wall Street in 2019 and has made it the standout IPO of the year as it has outpaced IPO class peers  The growth runway for the plant based meat industry looks promising but it must capitalize on its first mover advantage Its Costco announcement did little to please investors just yet  But the continued effort to get Beyond Meat s products into more stores and restaurants is a good sign moving forward  While our estimates project a significant top line slowdown in fiscal 2020  it also calls for Beyond Meat s first profitable year  which would be a great feat for the young company Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device

176999,398515,GPS,Is Gap  GPS  A Profitable Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Gap has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 4  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 42  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Gap s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 99  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Gap has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 27  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Gap has a P S ratio of about 0 41  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 53 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  GPS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Gap currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Gap a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Gap is just 1 14  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 52  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  GPS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though Gap might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of F  This gives GPS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen six downward revision compared to two upward in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has declined by 16  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has decreased by 5 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Gap  Inc  Price and Consensus

177036,398552,GPS,The Trade War Is About to Hit Your Pocket  Literally,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Americans better make the most of their Labor Day discount shopping  It could be the last they see for a long time 
A 15  tariff that went into effect Sept  1 on about  112 billion of goods imported from China will start pushing up prices of clothing  shoes and other consumer goods arriving at U S  ports this week 
That should start taking a serious toll on shopping in the U S  While 82  of intermediate inputs are already affected by tariffs  just 29  of consumer goods have had levies to date  That figure will now rise to 69   and 99  when a final tranche is imposed on Dec  15  according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics 
The Trump administration   or at least its trade representative  Robert Lighthizer   has recognized the risk of bringing the trade war to consumers  pockets  The current total war scenario  with tariffs imposed on almost the entirety of imports from China  was  first threatened more than a year ago  but Lighthizer has worked hard to excise the sorts of goods purchased by price sensitive shoppers from his product lists 
The latest escalation means that sort of strategic precision is no longer possible  Around the country  apparel retailers have already worked out where best to jack up prices  while toy shops and sporting goods stores will be doing the same ahead of the post Thanksgiving tranche 
One unexpected ally for the Trump administration is the retail industry itself  This is a business that invented the term  sticker shock   after all  so trying to hide the costs of Trump s policies from consumers isn t exactly unfamiliar terrain 
 The teams are working on a targeted pricing strategy in certain categories   Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   Chief Financial Officer Teri List Stoll  told an investor call last month 
 We have lots of tools in place to monitor elasticity and what the competitive environment is   Kohl s Corp  Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass told analysts Aug  21   So we ll make very sound and surgical decisions  
There s already a model for how this is likely to play out  One of the first rounds of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration applied a 25  levy on washing machines  but an April study by economists at the Federal Reserve and University of Chicago found that retailers instead decided to spread the pain around 
Prices for washing machines jumped about 12  more than those of comparable goods after the levies were imposed   which might have suggested that stores and suppliers were taking some of the pain rather than passing the full 25  cost onto consumers  There was a telling exception  though  The price of dryers rose by about the same magnitude  despite the fact that they weren t affected by the tariffs  In other words  retailers were splitting the extra cost between two similar products in an attempt to minimize the apparent rise in prices 
As a result  shoppers are unlikely to see markup racks with  Prices raised on account of trade war  tags on them  Instead  watch out for harder to pin down increases in categories where individual chains have pricing power  as well as weakening of gross margins  cost sharing with Chinese vendors  and efforts to shift parts of the supply chain to other source countries  Returns on equity for consumer and durable goods companies in the S P 500 index are already at recessionary levels  despite the general buoyancy of stocks in 2019  you d be bold to bet that was set to improve over the balance of the year 
Consumer sentiment is tracking down from its recent rosy levels in any case  Expectations for the economy suffered their sharpest monthly fall since 2012 in the University of Michigan s latest survey  Views of current conditions fell to their lowest level since President Donald Trump was elected  and Republicans posted their most pessimistic consumer sentiment since Trump s inauguration  1

177054,398570,GPS,H M Gains as Retailer Shows Early Progress Toward Turnaround,news," Bloomberg     Hennes   Mauritz AB  ST HMb  surged after the struggling Swedish clothing retailer showed progress coping with a buildup of unsold garments  raising hopes that the worst may be over after a three year slump in earnings 
Inventory dropped slightly as a proportion of sales  easing to 18 2  at the end of May from a record 18 9  as of last August  H M said Thursday  Chief Executive Officer Karl Johan Persson said H M still aims to boost operating profit this year  The stock rose as much as 11  Thursday in Stockholm 
A pickup in revenue growth at the start of the third quarter  helped by a heat wave in Europe  is boosting optimism that the retailer may have returned to a level of sales growth that could gradually put the inventory issue behind it  H M pledged to reduce discounts for a fourth consecutive quarter as it aims to reduce its 40 billion kronor   4 5 billion  buildup of unsold garments 
Analysts pointed to the June revenue growth of 12  as the trigger for the share gain  The stock can be volatile because short sellers have targeted H M  betting against almost a fifth of the freely traded shares 
Better Composition
The retailer said that the composition of inventory has improved  implying it will become easier to sell the garments  The family controlled company has a goal of eventually reducing stock in trade to 12  to 14  of sales  a level last seen three years ago  When asked in an interview if that could take four of five years  CEO Persson said it should be less than that  saying he s  confident  H M is heading in the right direction 
 H M is improving its offer  which should lead to a sales and earnings recovery in time  albeit with execution risk in an ongoing tough competitive environment   wrote Richard Chamberlain  an analyst at RBC Europe 
The company has recently been offering discounts of up to half off on summer clothes  offering  1 99 camisole tops   25 99 faux leather biker jackets and skinny jeans for  8 99 
H M also cut this year s store expansion plan by 26  while pledging more investment in e commerce  H M now expects 130 net store openings  further decelerating from a rate that exceeded 400 in recent years  Most of the new H M shops will be outside of Europe and the U S  as the retailer seeks faster growing markets 
H M has been plowing investment into e commerce  adding online sales in Mexico  Thailand  Indonesia and Egypt this year 
The Swedish retailer is trying to catch up after Zara owner  Inditex   MC ITX  SA made it possible to order clothes from its chains from virtually anywhere in the world  H M s e commerce reach extends to about 48 markets 
Inditex has forecast sales growth of 4  to 6  this year on a like for like basis as the Spanish retailer outperforms rivals such as Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  
H M is also trying to catch up with Inditex s lead in RFID  a technology that allows retailers to track the location of clothes in stores and warehouses to boost efficiency  The Swedish retailer said it now uses RFID in 15 markets  Zara uses it in all its stores 
The Swedish retailer said it plans to launch H M on Indian e commerce platform Myntra and its   Other Stories chain on China s Tmall by this autumn 
H M warned that the weak krona is still pushing up buying costs as the retailer buys the bulk of its garments in Asia  where prices are linked to dollars  The krona was on average about 10  weaker against the dollar in the second quarter 
Pretax profit dropped 1 3  in the three months through May  missing analysts  estimates and declining an eighth consecutive quarter ",2019-06-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hm-gains-as-retailer-shows-early-progress-toward-turnaround-1909145,1909145
177055,398571,GPS,Levi s slims down China supply chain exposure as trade war rages on,news,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK  Reuters     Levi Strauss   Co   N LEVI  has been  deliberate and diligent  in moving production out of China because of uncertainty hanging over tariffs on goods imported from China  Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said in an interview with Reuters 
Just 1  or 2  of Levi s product sold in the United States are manufactured in China  Bergh said  compared to 16  two years ago  Bergh was speaking one day before President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on another  300 billion of Chinese goods  including apparel 
Trump has used tariffs as a tool to negotiate better trade terms  saying bad deals cost millions of U S  jobs  Along with apparel  the new tariffs hit consumer goods such as electronics and toys and come in addition to those already imposed on  250 billion of other goods imported from China 
The on again  off again nature of the U S  tariffs on Chinese goods had created uncertainty for many U S  retailers  Bergh said 
 Every day is a new day   he said   Sometimes it looks like it s definitely going to happen and then other days you think it s off  it s not going to happen  
San Francisco based Levi s  which returned to the public markets in March  is part of a wave of retailers that have been shifting supply chains out of China to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh  The trend was initially in response to higher Chinese wages but the exodus is expected to be accelerated by the new tariffs  which Trump said will go into effect Sept  1 
They are expected to increase consumers  costs and have an impact across the entire retail industry 
Apparel retailers like Gap Inc  N GPS   handbag brand Steve Madden Ltd  O SHOO  and department store Macy s Inc  N M  also have acted to move production out of China 
However  China still is a big supplier to the industry with 42  of apparel and 69  of footwear sold in the United States made in China  according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association 
Following the latest tariff news  several large retail trade groups warned the levied tariffs will hurt consumer purchases  raise prices and limit hiring 
Levi s has two of its own factories in Poland and South Africa but mostly uses third party vendors or suppliers spread across 22 different countries  said Bergh  who joined the company in September 2011 
 We ve narrowed down our supplier base during the time that I ve been here to really develop deeper  more strategic relationships with many of our suppliers   he said 
Many of Levi s suppliers in China are publicly traded companies that have multi country footprints  said Bergh  that have diversified risk by building factories in places like Vietnam and Cambodia 
Among Levi s best selling products are the 501 men s jeans  which go for between  39 99 and  49 99  according to Levi s website 
Trump also has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico in retaliation for illegal immigration largely from Central America  across the U S  Mexican border  He is pushing Congress to approve the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA   a deal his administration reached to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  
Levi s also has put contingency plans in place  not just for China but also for Mexico in the event that NAFTA gets ripped up in a moment of rage or something   Bergh said ",2019-08-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/levis-slims-down-china-supply-chain-exposure-as-trade-war-rages-on-1944157,1944157

177077,398593,GPS,Foot Locker Stock  FL  Takes A Step Back,opinion,"Foot Locker  Inc  NYSE FL  financials for the second quarter of the year leaves much to be desired for investors  And its stock  NYSE FL  is feeling the brunt of the negative impact  Shares of FL are down 18  so far today after the financials were released  and is still falling  Below are several highlights from the latest quarterly report 
Comparable store sales rose by only 0 8  when the market was expecting 3 3   Compare this to the previous quarter of 5    and then 10  at the end of 2018 Gross profitability slipped to 30 1  of sales from 30 2  and expenses increased as the retailer spent money on its e commerce infrastructure  As a result  operating income fell to  81 million  or 4 6  of sales  from  112 million  or 6 2  of sales Inventory fell 1  after accounting for currency exchange shifts  putting the company in a flexible position heading into the seasonally strong second half of the year The company had to close a net of 27 stores  But 3 174 locations are still in operation by the end of the quarter 
Despite the negative earnings report  the company still remains relatively optimistic about the upcoming 2 quarters  The CEO Richard A Johnson says   while the results of the second quarter did come in at the low of our expectations  we saw an improvement in our performance as we move through each month of the quarter   The company is hoping earnings will pick up in the second half of 2019  Mr  Johnson owns over 80 000 units of  Foot Locker   NYSE FL  stock worth over  13 million  In addition  he earns  6 3 million as Chairman of the Board  President  and Chief Executive Officer at Foot Locker 
The footwear retailer started to show signs of slowing growth in the previous quarter  and many of its products have been threatened by the trade tensions between the U S  and China  Those tariffs and new geopolitical regulations could raise Foot Locker s costs and force the company to sacrifice either sales growth for profitability  or vice versa  Consumers also seem to be spending less than expected so far this year  Consumer spending increased by only 0 9  in Q1 2019  Strong consumer spending is necessary for the GDP growth rate to stay between the 2  to 3  healthy range  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U S  economy is in a favorable place but faces  significant risks   He also said that   trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States  
Of course the slowing economy and trade wars do not only affect  Foot Locker   NYSE FL   Other retailers are facing the same headwinds  Clothing company  Gap Inc   NYSE NYSE GPS  is also seeing lower stock prices  Its same store sales are lower than the previous quarter  Gap owns a few different brands such as Old Navy and Banana Republic  And all of its brands had a negative year  The company originally projected an adjusted EPS of 2 14  but has now lowered its expectations to 2 08 for the year 
Brick and mortar apparel retailers are in a very tough spot right now  With the rise of  and the cost of operating stores increase  it s getting harder for businesses to make money in this space  And this means it will be difficult for investors to find value  The future looks uncertain for companies like  Foot Locker   NYSE FL  and Gap  I would be weary about buying any stocks in this industry for the time being and focus on other growing sectors such as technology or industrial  Until Foot Locker can prove that it can transitions to become a successful online store  it will hard for it to stay relevant moving forward ",2019-08-25,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/foot-locker-stock-fl-takes-a-step-back-200458314,200458314
177079,398595,GPS,Gap Stock Loses 21  In 3 Months  Is It Likely To Turnaround ,opinion,The Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS   has been in the doldrums for quite some time  thanks to persistent softness at its namesake brand  We note that the brand has been witnessing traffic challenges as well as operational headwinds across the business  This has been hurting the company s total comparable sales  comps  and top line performance Although the company has lost 21 1  in the past three months  it fared better than the  s 25 5  decline  The stock s decline can be attributed to disappointing results in second quarter fiscal 2019  wherein both the top and bottom line declined year over year Despite reporting an earnings beat in the fiscal second quarter  shares of the company declined 4 7  after it released quarterly results on Aug 22  Moreover  the soft top line trend persisted in the quarter  With this  Gap s revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third consecutive quarter However  Gap s earnings surprise trend remains impressive  with a beat in eight of the trailing 10 quarters  Furthermore  its solid omni channel endeavors and robust brand strength might help the company bring back its lost shine Let s Delve DeeperAs stated earlier  softness at the Gap brand persisted in the fiscal second quarter  with a 7  comps decline  wider than a 5  fall in the year ago quarter  Encouragingly  management is taking actions to revitalize this brand by streamlining its specialty fleet and enhancing marketing model to drive customer engagement  In relation to streamlining specialty fleet  it expects to shut down roughly 230 stores by fiscal 2020  This will result in sales decline of nearly  625 million annually  In fiscal 2019  it anticipates to shut down nearly 130 stores  However  we expect the brand to take some time to return to profitability Weak comps due to lower traffic and adverse foreign currency translations weighed on the company s sales in the fiscal second quarter  Comps decreased 4   with a decline across each of the company s brands  Also  the quarter witnessed lower sales and soft margins as well as deleveraged SG A expenses  While gross margin contracted 90 basis points  bps  mainly due to lower merchandise margin  adjusted operating margin shriveled 140 bps Consequently  Gap continues to anticipate comps decline in the low single digits range for fiscal 2019 owing to challenging traffic trends  Furthermore  the company now envisions earnings per share of  1 88  2 08  down from  2 04  2 14 projected earlier  Adjusted earnings are estimated to come in at  2 05  2 15  significantly down from  2 59 earned in fiscal 2018 Strategic Endeavors Might Aid a TurnaroundGap is enhancing its e commerce and omni channel capabilities by adopting a number of initiatives  Evidently  the company has increased online presence across all of its brands  In fact  Gap s online division is one of its most profitable segments with robust sales growth  Apparently  the company has rolled out the Buy Online Pick up in Store  BOPIS  for its Old Navy brand throughout the nation  which is receiving a positive response from customers Recently  Gap s iconic brand  Banana Republic  announced plans to launch Style Passport for its women s apparel collection at the end of September in the United States  This is an online service  wherein subscribers are allowed to rent the brand s products for a flat monthly fee with choices to keep and purchase the items  The company is likely to launch this service for men s apparel range later on  Furthermore  Banana Republic will provide BOPIS facility beginning this fall  Impressively  this latest service is expected to reach out to more customers  helping the company to collect exclusive and valuable shoppers  insights Meanwhile  Gap s Old Navy brand  which is focused on creating affordable high quality fashion for the whole family  is a significant long term growth opportunity for the company  Additionally  Gap has been experiencing significant progress in its smaller brands  It also continues to benefit from the Janie and Jack clothing brand  backed by roughly 140 U S  locations and a profitable online channel  Furthermore  the company remains focused on its growth brands  with more store openings for Athleta  Old Navy and Gap China locations These apart  Gap s spin off plans of splitting into two independent public companies  Old Navy and the yet to be named company  are an added positive  Management expects this spin off to enable these two stand alone companies to strategically focus on their initiatives and operating structure in order to capitalize on growth opportunities Currently  Gap carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  3 Better Ranked Retail

177096,398612,GPS,Gap Analysts Say Old Navy Can Now Get Multiple It Deserves,news," Bloomberg     Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   s plans to split off its Old Navy brand from its Gap namesake and other brands overshadowed the fourth quarter results  sending shares soaring in Friday s session 
Analysts applauded the decision  saying the split could provide a greater valuation for Old Navy    with analysts estimating per share value as much as seven times greater than that of NewCo  which will hold the Gap  Banana Republic and Athleta brands  Telsey Advisory Group initially targets an Old Navy value at  35 per share  while B  Riley FBR pegs it at about  23  The NewCo management team will also get greater opportunity to focus on fixing the other brands with more targeted investments and resources 
Gap shares surged as much as 21 percent to  30 65  the highest intraday since Aug  30 
Here s what analysts are saying 
Telsey Advisory Group  Dana Telsey
 Given what we see as the ability to further unlock shareholder value from the spin off of the ON business  we are taking our price target up to  40 from  34 previously   Specifically  Telsey values Old Navy at  35 per share and NewCo at  5  Rates outperform 
 NewCo can benefit from a rebalanced Gap brand  the Athleta growth component  and a healthier BR at an attractive valuation  
 Fourth quarter results may not have been worse than feared  EPS came in better than expected and the Gap brand comp matched market estimates  while a comp shortfall at ON came against a strong 9  compare from a year ago at a time of understood macro headwinds  
Meanwhile  the high end of the year EPS forecast is just 2 percent to 3 percent below the consensus estimate of  2 62 
Cowen  Oliver Chen
 We do expect stock upside as investors are able to attribute a higher multiple to Old Navy and its value driven orientation which is well positioned for growth  Ideally  changes should enable greater focus   more efficient allocation of investment dollars at each respective company  
Rates market perform and raises his price target to  32 from  29 based on sum of the parts analysis that estimates Old Navy s equity value can be about  9 5 billion  which implies EV Ebitda multiple of about 7 5 times  compared with Gap s current combined EV Ebitda multiple of about 6 times  Expects the equity value for NewCo to be close to  2 7 billion  which implies EV Ebitda multiple of about 4 times 
B Riley FRB  Susan Anderson
Views the planned separation of Old Navy and the major re sizing of the Gap store fleet  favorably  as the NewCo  Gap  Banana Republic  Athleta and others  takes  necessary steps towards modernization  and likely gives the Gap brand more focus vs  previously  
Sum of the parts analysis valued the entire company at  32  Old Navy at  23  Gap Global  4  Banana Republic at  2 and other brands  Athleta  etc   at  3 
Rates neutral  price target  30 
Deutsche Bank  Paul Trussell
 The announcement to create two publicly traded companies  Old Navy and NewCo  has overshadowed results and surprised investors  
The fourth quarter results showcased that  challenges remain  particularly at the Gap brand   although Old Navy sales also missed and trends there remain  soft  quarter to date 
 We applaud management on the pending transaction which unlocks meaningful shareholder value given Old Navy s margin profile and long runway of growth ahead   including low  to mid single digit comp  sales square foot growth 
Rates hold  boosts price target to  34 from  30
Citi  Paul Lejuez
 There was a clear deterioration  in the business during the fourth quarter that is being overshadowed by news of the Old Navy separation   We believe the stock would have traded lower on 4Q earnings  without the spin news

177097,398613,GPS,Find Out What s Behind Gap s  GPS  26  Slump In 3 Months ,opinion,The Gap  Inc     NYSE GPS   has been in rough waters for a while now due to persistent softness at the namesake brand  The brand has been witnessing operational headwinds across its business owing to assortment issues  which are denting its performance  This has also been hurting the company s comparable sales  comps  and top line performance All these weighed upon the company s first quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year  Management also lowered its earnings outlook for fiscal 2019   Read   Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been witnessing a downtrend  We note that estimates for current and next year have moved south by 36 cents and 39 cents  respectively  to  2 07 and  2 16 over the past 30 days In the past three months  shares of this San Francisco  CA based company tumbled approximately 26   wider than the  s decline of 15 2   Let s take a look at what s ailing this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock Reasons Behind Gap s Dismal RunGap s namesake brand has been in soup for quite a while now due to issues at its merchandises  During first quarter fiscal 2019  comps for the Gap brand fell 10  wider than comps decline of 5  and 4  in the previous and year ago quarter  respectively  We note that the brand has been witnessing operational headwinds across its business as well as assortment issues While management remains on track to revitalize the Gap brand by streamlining its specialty fleet and renewing marketing model to enhance customer engagement  these actions should attract significant costs and also continue to weigh on top line growth  In relation to streamlining specialty fleet  it expects to shut down roughly 230 stores in the next two years  This is likely to result in sales decline of nearly  625 million annually  Moreover  management estimates pre tax costs of  250  300 million Nevertheless  these restructuring measures are likely to generate annualized pre tax savings of nearly  90 million  These actions will lead to about 40  of sales from online  while 60  will come from the specialty and value channels   In fiscal 2019  Gap anticipates to shut down nearly 130 stores related to the restructuring of the Gap brand fleet  Although these efforts appear promising  the return of the brand to profitability is not anticipated in the near future  Moreover  lost sales from store closures and higher expenses might weigh on the overall profitability For fiscal 2019  the company anticipates comps to be down low single digits compared with the prior projection of flat to up slightly  Furthermore  it now envisions earnings per share of  2 04  2 14 for the fiscal year  down from  2 11  2 26 expected earlier  Adjusted earnings are estimated to come in at  2 05  2 15  down from the prior projection of  2 40  2 55 and  2 59 earned in fiscal 2018 A Ray of HopeThe company s efforts to boost digital and mobile offerings alongside improving product acceptance are encouraging  The company s online division is one of its most profitable segments with robust sales growth  Notably  robust online trends in first quarter fiscal 2019 led to high teen comps growth driven by increase in traffic and conversion Apparently  Gap has rolled out the Buy Online Pick up in Store  BOPIS  for its Old Navy brand throughout the nation  which is receiving positive response from customers  Previously  the company expanded omni channel endeavors like the  find in store    Reserve in Store  and  Order in Store  capabilities across various stores These initiatives  combined with constant digital investments should boost Gap s top line and profitability  Moreover  we believe the company s plans to spin off into two companies will help management to better focus on growth initiatives and improve operating efficiency ConclusionThough the aforementioned efforts reflect steps taken in the right path  these will take time to yield results and win back investors  confidence  Meanwhile  the current dismal performance remains a trouble for the stock 3 Stocks to

177098,398614,GPS,Bear Of The Day  Gap Inc   GPS ,opinion,"Gap Inc  NYSE GPS    GPS  is a global retailer that sells casual apparel  accessories  and shoes for men  women  and kids under three core brands  Gap  Old Navy  and Banana Republic  The company also owns successful athleisure brands Athleta and Hill City  as well as Intermix  its luxe designer boutique chain 
Weak Q1 Earnings Hurt Shares
Earnings of 24 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents per share and decreased 43  year over year  Total revenues of  3 7 billion also lagged behind our consensus estimate 
Comparable sales declined 4  from the prior year period  Even Old Navy  which is the company s strongest brand  posted a comps decline  while the Gap brand reported a 10  decrease 
There will likely be more struggles ahead  Management expects a low single digit decline in full year comparable sales  which is down from the previous outlook of flat to up slightly  The forecast for adjusted EPS was also reduced to between  2 05 and  2 15  down from  2 40 to  2 55 
 This quarter was extremely challenging  and we are not at all satisfied with our results   CEO Art Peck said in a press release  
Gap shares were already under pressure before releasing its first quarter results  apparel stocks across the board got hit hard in May as did the rest of the market due to ongoing trade tensions  China and the U S  implemented new tariffs that month that threatened retailers 
Falling EstimatesAnalysts have since turned bearish on Gap  with 11 cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 39 cents during that same time period from  2 46 to  2 07 per share  earnings could now see a roughly 20  year over year decline for fiscal 2020 
This sentiment has stretched into 2021  and our consensus estimate has dropped 39 cents in the past two months as well 
GPS is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Bottom Line
Going forward  Peck said that he is still confident in the company s plan to make Old Navy and the other brands into two separate publicly traded companies next year  However  the popularity of online shopping and the slow decline away from mall based retailers will likely still impact Gap and its brands down the line 
If you re an investor interested in adding a stock from the broad retail sector to your portfolio  consider The Children s Place  PLCE   PLCE  which is the biggest pure play children s appareler in North America  has not been the biggest gainer this year  but the Zacks Consensus estimate for fiscal 2020 has jumped 70 cents  with five analysts revising their estimates higher over the past 60 days  Plus  the company pays a solid dividend with a yield of 2 38

To be certain  the Gap is not the brand it once was  Its Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Talking About Count has shrunk over time   and its Facebook We re Here Count  not pictured  has also been disappointing as of late  But  it may not be losing customers   so much as it is losing stores  and our next graphic tracks that  




Gap is running fewer stores these days  In fact  it seems to be scaling back its footprint each quarter  After the first quarter of this year  it saw store count draw back 2 78   and so far this quarter  store count appears to have fallen another 5   And  this could go a long way to explain our final graphic 




Every year  to staff up for both back to school shopping and for the holidays  Gap has a recent history of staffing up big time  But  it s slowing  as its store count continues to slide  Job postings increased about 13  in 2018  This year  They rose less than 7   And next quarter will include a critical read on the company s fall sales prospects   so if the lag in hiring continues  it spells further challenges for the clothing retailer  
In the first quarter of this year  Gap announced it would divide itself from Old Navy  a similar retailer that has had better prospects  It s not clear what Gap s post Old Navy strategy is   but it is cleaving off one of its growing brands  perhaps in part to satisfy both analysts and investors disappointed with the company s share price as of late

177129,398645,GPS,More Econ Data Mop Up  Gap  Foot Locker Surprise In Q4,opinion,"Friday  March 1  2019New economic data has come out ahead of Friday s open on major trading indexes  and some mopping up from previous delayed reads accompany these results  Personal Income for December  because the 5 week government shutdown had kept these numbers from being formulated until now  rose a solid 1 0   much higher than the 0 4  expected and the 0 2  reported in November However  this same metric for the month of January  also reported this morning  went to  0 1   much lower than the previous read and the  0 3  analysts had anticipated  Consumer Spending in December fell 0 5   10 basis points lower than expectations These December results were already brought to the surface with yesterday s Q4 GDP report  but today s release allows for a closer look at these metrics  And while the knee jerk reaction may be to sell this January news on lower growth  one should consider seasonality when looking at Q1 economic reads in any year  
For instance  2018   which may be the first to finish above 3  growth in more than a decade   still brought a Q1 read of 2 2   the lowest quarter of the year  Winter months cause some dormancy in most markets  especially following holiday shopping season in Q4 January s Consumer Spending is still delayed this morning  But the December read does not immediately generate much optimism for the following month  Of course  all of these figures for January feed into Q1 GDP for 2019  which will not only be lower than Q4 but quite likely below the 2 2  reported a year ago  In fact  many analysts do not expect 2019 GDP overall to be anywhere near as high as the year just finished Q4 Earnings RoundupShares of The Gap   NYSE GPS   are surging ahead of the bell  up more than 20  on a mixed Q4 report but an intriguing prospect  the spinning off of its Old Navy brand to its own publicly traded company  The core group   consisting of Gap  Banana Republic  Athleta and other brands  and currently referred to as  NewCo   indicating the Gap name may be ending   would control roughly  9 billion in assets  while Old Navy would be worth  8 billion  And Foot Locker   NYSE FL   shares are up 13  ahead of regular day trading on its Q4 results that came in better than expected  Earnings of  1 56 per share easily surpassed the  1 37 expected  while revenues grew 2 8  year over year to  2 272 billion  Year over year comps grew an impressive 9 7   which more than doubled expectations  Mark VickerySenior Editor

177136,398652,GPS,Trump Sees Gain in China Tariffs Despite Consumer Pain,news," Bloomberg     The Trump administration said it needs to confront China over its trading practices to defend U S  long term interests even as escalating tariffs cause discomfort for American consumers 
Inaction by the U S  would leave the American economy and consumers worse off over the longer run  a senior administration official told reporters at a briefing on Friday  speaking on the condition of anonymity 
U S  industry has widely pushed back against the Trump administration s use of tariffs to force changes to China s economy  and companies from Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   to Samsonite International SA have said they re prepared to raise prices if the new tariffs bite into their business 
Trump s biggest strike yet in a growing trade fight between the world s biggest economies will see a 10 percent duty applied to  200 billion of Chinese imports on Monday  which could rise to 25 percent next year  He s threatened duties on a further  267 billion of made in China goods  which would hit nearly all other consumer products including mobile phones  shoes and clothes 
The latest round of duties comes on top of a 25 percent tariff already imposed on about  50 billion in Chinese goods  which spurred counter tariffs from Beijing  China plans to retaliate on the U S  s  200 billion tariff round by slapping levies on  60 billion of American goods 
 Pinching Pennies 
 The new  200 billion of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods  mostly consumer oriented  will depress spending and hurt the retail sector beginning in 2019   Seema Shah and Danielle McIntee  analysts with Bloomberg Intelligence  wrote in a note on Friday   Lower income families  already pinching pennies  are most exposed  given the likelihood of tariff related price increases on everyday items  
The U S  is monitoring plans for Chinese retaliation to the  200 billion round of levies  but it has nothing to announce yet on a further round of duties  the official said 
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier this week said the tariffs are spread over such a wide range of goods that Americans shouldn t notice price increases 
 We were trying to do things that were least intrusive on the consumer   Ross said on CNBC on Tuesday   We really went item by item trying to figure out what would accomplish the punitive purpose on China and yet with the least disruption in the U S  
The U S  remains open to trade negotiations with China but there s no scheduled meetings at the moment  the official said  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has extended an invitation to resume trade talks with his Chinese counterparts  The Asian nation had said they d refuse to negotiate if the Trump administration followed through with the  200 billion tariff round ",2018-09-21,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-sees-gain-in-china-tariffs-despite-consumer-pain-1619547,1619547

177164,398680,GPS,Is Deep Value ETF  DVP  A Strong ETF Right Now ,opinion,"The Deep Value ETF  DVP  was launched on 09 22 2014  and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Style Box   Large Cap Value category of the market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
For a long time now  the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes  which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment 
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes  as they replicate market returns in a low cost  convenient  and transparent way 
There are some investors  though  who think it s possible to beat the market with great stock selection  this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta  which track non cap weighted strategies 
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk return performance  based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics 
Even though this space provides many choices to investors  think one of the simplest methodologies like equal weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility momentum based weighting  not all have been able to deliver first rate results 
Fund Sponsor   Index
The fund is managed by Exchange Traded Concepts  and has been able to amass over  220 68 M  which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box   Large Cap Value  Before fees and expenses  DVP seeks to match the performance of the TWM Deep Value Index 
TWM Deep Value Index is constructed using an objective  rules based methodology that begins with an initial universe that mirrors the companies listed on the S P 500 Index 
Cost   Other Expenses
When considering an ETF s total return  expense ratios are an important factor  And  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal 
Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0 59  for DVP  making it one of the more expensive products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 2 73

177200,398716,GPS,As Congress moves to drop tariffs  some U S  firms cry foul,news,"By Andy Sullivan NAPLES  Fla   Reuters    Michael Korchmar was hiring  His family owned travel goods company was planning to make a new product  an insulated food bag  and he had put out help wanted notices for up to 30 workers to run the sewing machines in his small factory on Florida s Gulf Coast  Those plans are now on hold  The reason  a bill quietly moving through Congress that would temporarily reduce or eliminate protective tariffs on 1 662 products  including the type of bag Korchmar had planned to produce  The bill would cut costs for rivals who make their bags in low cost countries like China  he said  squeezing him out of the market before he had even entered it   Given that these products will be able to come into the country duty free  it s not likely that there s any ability for us to compete   Korchmar said in a recent interview at his factory  which currently employs about 20 people  Even as President Trump threatens to slap protective tariffs on steel and aluminum  lawmakers are moving forward with legislation to lower trade barriers on hundreds of other products  from chemicals to toasters  in a bid to lower costs for U S  companies and consumers   Supporters of the so called miscellaneous tariff bill  which unanimously passed the House of Representatives in January  say it would boost the economy by getting rid of tariffs designed to protect U S  industries that no longer exist  The National Association of Manufacturers says U S  companies pay hundreds of millions of dollars each year on unnecessary import fees   Critics say that miscellaneous tariff bills  which began decades ago as modest efforts to help U S  manufacturers  have in recent years become sprawling packages of tariff reductions that undercut domestic producers without the means to defend their interests in Washington  Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown  a Democrat who worked to get several products removed from the current bill  said Congress should do a better job to ensure tariff reductions do not impede U S  producers   Miscellaneous Tariff Bills should help  not hurt American manufacturers   Brown said in a statement to Reuters   BATTERIES  MOUTH GUARDS AND KNIVES Miscellaneous tariff bills were originally conceived in the 1980s as a way of lowering costs for U S  manufacturers that could not get chemicals and other component products from domestic sources  The original point of the efforts  was to encourage domestic manufacturing   recalls Jennifer Hillman  who worked on the legislation as a Senate staffer in the 1980s and 1990s  All but two of the 163 items in a 1999 version of the bill  for example  were used in the manufacturing process  according to a House Ways and Means Committee report   Since then  Congress has broadened successive tariff bills to include many finished products that can go straight to store shelves   Only 55 percent of the items in the current bill are  intermediate goods  used in manufacturing  according to applications filed with the International Trade Commission  Many of the rest are finished consumer products   Hamilton Beach Brands  for example  would pay reduced tariffs on Chinese made toaster ovens  steam irons and other household items it used to make domestically  Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  would be able to import vests  sweaters and 14 other types of clothing duty free  while PetSmart Inc would no longer have to pay tariffs on certain pet crates and chew toys  Camera maker GoPro Inc would be able to import 31 types of camera accessories duty free   None of the companies responded to requests for comment about the inclusion of their products   Ron Sorini  a lobbyist who has helped clothing manufacturers get items in the bill  says consumers benefit from reduced tariffs  too  since companies can lower their prices    Why in the world would we put a tariff on a product that s not made in the U S   It s kind of crazy   he said  Any importer can take advantage of rates lowered by the bill  not just the ones that applied for them  and the reductions last only three years to help ensure they don t permanently freeze out would be domestic manufacturers   Under the latest rules  set in 2016  companies seeking lower tariffs submit applications to the International Trade Commission  which then works with the Commerce Department to determine whether any of the items are made domestically  If the agencies learn of U S  producers  they invite the companies to submit objections  ITC staffers then assess whether the objections are legitimate    GLAD WE GOT WIND OF IT  In the current bill  the ITC eliminated 385 products because of objections from domestic producers  Even so  the bill includes 145 items that are made domestically  according to a Reuters analysis of ITC records   An ITC spokeswoman declined to comment on the commission s actions beyond pointing to the recommendations it ultimately made  Several companies told Reuters that the ITC was receptive to their concerns   I m just glad we got wind of it when we did and stopped it   said Anson Martin  a vice president at Illinois battery company Inventus Power  which successfully objected to the inclusion of 18 types of batteries in the bill  He said he learned of the proposed tariff reductions through his trade association  Other companies said they were not aware they had missed a chance to defend their interests   Alan Peppel  president of Massachusetts based knife manufacturer Dexter Russell Inc  said he had no idea until receiving a call from Reuters that Congress was poised to eliminate tariffs on a type of kitchen knife his company produces   Kansas City dentist Don Closson  who makes athletic mouth guards at a Colorado factory  and Paul Cacciotti  who manufactures fingernail clippers in upstate New York  also said they were unaware the bill contained items competing with those they make    Many American manufacturing companies have been put out of business due to free trade agreements and tariff reductions  and you think the politicians would have learned a lesson from past experience   Cacciotti said  The bill s supporters say that businesses have only themselves to blame if they do not defend their interests in Washington   If somebody doesn t know about something  that s a shame  but that might mean that they didn t take steps to stay informed   said Stephen Lamar  executive vice president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association  Norman Cook  executive vice president of Genfoot America Inc does not think it is that simple  Genfoot  which employs 200 people at a New Hampshire boot factory  managed to block 22 types of footwear on the grounds that they were too similar to products the company makes domestically  But the bill still includes 42 other types of boots and shoes that Genfoot sees as a threat to its business   
 It s supposed to help manufacturers  not eliminate them   Cook said ",2018-03-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/as-congress-moves-to-drop-tariffs-some-us-firms-cry-foul-1324022,1324022

177252,398768,GPS,Fossil Gains 69  In 3 Months  Is Wearables The Only Driver ,opinion,Fossil Group  Inc    NASDAQ FOSL    which was long shunned by investors owing to persistent softness in traditional watch category  has made quite a comeback  The company  which lost close to 70  in 2017  has rallied a whopping 69  in the past three months against the  s decline of 8 2    So what made the renowned watch and accessories brand turn around  Well  the company s wearables category has actually been contributing significantly  While Fossil is gaining from several other factors as well  strength in wearables seems to be its major driver  given consumers  accelerated shift toward tech savvy watches Wearables Helps Fossil Tread Growth TrajectoryTo tap in on the rising demand for advanced gadgets  Fossil has been investing heavily to broaden its connected wearables portfolio  The wearables market provides the opportunity to combine fashion and technology and launch innovative products to meet consumers  evolving needs of tech enabled advanced connected gears  Moreover  the company is getting the advantage of Android s popularity and Google s technology in its watches Clearly  Fossil s transition to connected wearables and smartwatches has reaped results  The growing demand for advanced gadgets is reflected from the fact that Fossil s connected products have almost doubled in the past two years  reaching close to  300 million in size  In fact  wearables represented almost 20  of the company s total watch sales in the fourth quarter of 2017  That s not it Growth in the wearable s category aided Fossil s overall watch category to improve by more than 10 percentage points during the quarter  Additionally  the strong performance of wearables drove online sales  leading to a 2  rise in the company s global retail comps during the quarter  while the watch category alone depicted comps growth of 5  Notably  Fossil launched around 14 new hybrid and smartwatches across several brands during the second half of 2017The company is gearing up to enrich wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line up in 2018 as the wearable business is expected to grow  32 billion by 2020   E commerce   New World Fossil   Other Keys to Fossil s Success StoryOther than the marked success of its wearables category  Fossil has also been riding on solid focus on enhancing e commerce operations  as well as its  New World Fossil  plan  Talking of e commerce  the company has been making several investments to improve digital marketing and drive online sales  both for the company s website as well as other online wholesale partners  In fact  such dedicated endeavors helped e commerce sales surge 31  during the fourth quarter  The e commerce platform has also served as an important sales channel for wearables Moving to New World Fossil  the company began this restructuring program back in 2016  The program aims to transform the company  fuel efficiencies  improve margins and enhance the overall operating structure of the business to drive profitability  Fossil intends to achieve these targets while simultaneously enriching customers  experience amid a difficult retail landscape  Markedly  the company is well on track with its New World Fossil plan which helped it cut costs by  95 million in 2017  keeping it well placed to achieve its profit improvement target of  200 million by the end of 2019 What s Ahead Unfortunately  Fossil has long been suffering from sluggish traditional watch business and persistent weakness in the leather and jewelry categories  These factors and strained gross margins acted as major dampeners on the company s fourth quarter top and bottom lines  Though management continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category in 2018  we expect the aforementioned factors  particularly strong wearables sales  to help this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to offset these hurdles Looking for More Promising Bets  Check These Trending Retail StocksBuckle Inc    NYSE BKE    with a robust earnings surprise history  carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

177278,398794,GPS,Is Gap  GPS  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Gap Inc    NYSE GPS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Gap has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 1   as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Gap s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Gap has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Gap stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Gap has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Gap currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Gap a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Gap might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A  This gives GPS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 18 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 6 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Gap  Inc   The  Price and Consensus     This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineGap is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 25  of more than 250 industries  instills investor optimism  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Gap The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted

177281,398797,GPS,5 Discounted PEG Stocks For Value Investors,opinion,"The success of billionaire value investor Warren Buffett underscores the efficiency of his investing mantra  Going by a Motley Fool article published last year  over the past 50 years  his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway s stock has yielded a compound annual return of 20 8   This indicates that an investment of  10 000 in 1965  is worth  88 million today However  apparently simple to understand  this investing discipline has its own share of pitfalls  A value investor mostly misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects and in their quest of cheaper stocks  they often end up picking stocks that have weak future prospects Buffett believes that proper understanding of the  intrinsic value  of a stock may ease out many problems with regard to value investment  According to him  going by the fundamentals of value investing while picking undervalued stocks  investors need to focus on their earnings growth potential While yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings  sales or book value are the most common value investing matrices that can easily single out stocks trading at a discount  these ratios fail to consider the potential of a stock  PEG is the ratio with the earnings growth component in it The PEG ratio is defined as   Price Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth  followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less

177306,398822,GPS,Vietnam pollution fight hits supplier to global fashion brands,news,By Mai Nguyen HANOI  Reuters    Vietnamese villagers blockading a textile plant that serves global fashion brands are seeking the permanent closure of the factory due to pollution concerns  highlighting a growing readiness in Vietnam to campaign over environmental issues  Hundreds of people from Hai Duong  50 km  30 miles  east of Hanoi  have kept watch in shifts day and night since April to stop work at the Pacific Crystal Textiles mill  operated by Hong Kong based Pacific Textiles  Among those affected by the stoppage is Japanese clothing giant UNIQLO  The blockade marks another challenge to the communist state s authority stemming from industrial pollution at a time when Vietnam is seeking more foreign investors to maintain one of Southeast Asia s highest growth rates  A toxic spill from a Taiwanese run steel mill in central Vietnam last year sparked unprecedented protests   The factory in Hai Duong opened in 2015 as a venture between Pacific Textiles Holdings Ltd and garment maker Crystal Group  Initial investment in the plant was reported at the time to be least  180 million  Villagers said they started to notice a bad smell last year   It was an unbearably rotten  foul  pungent smell   said 60 year old war veteran Vu Dinh Vinh  It got worse at night  When he and others investigated  he said  they found the smell came from water discharged from the factory   The company was fined 672 million dong   30 000  for that December spill  according to a statement on the Hai Duong authority s website in February  Water was found to have breached limits for acidity and alkalinity balance  color  total suspended solids  chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand   But villagers said they were still concerned  accusing the factory of continued pollution and setting up their blockade on April 12   When a delegation from the local authority visited on Wednesday to give the villagers a three day deadline to move  they said they were not going anywhere   We want to expel the factory and never let it produce again   said 70 year old Bui Van Nguyet   Pacific Textiles said there had been only one discharge of waste water  on Dec  24  2016  and that it had not reached the nearby river  Villagers were wrong to say pollution had continued  it said  Pacific Textiles  head of corporate social responsibility  Eugene Cheng  told Reuters steps had been taken to stop any discharge of waste water with the help of the local government   We did not understand the reason or motive behind them to shut down the factory as some of the villagers  relatives are also working for our factory   Cheng said  FINANCIAL IMPACT In regulatory announcements  the company has reported a  significant financial impact  because of the blockade at the factory  which had accounted for 10 percent of its sales   This week  Pacific Textiles said it was waiting for the local People s Committee and industrial park to  clear the blockage   Local authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment   UNIQLO owner  Japan s Fast Retailing  told Reuters it indirectly sourced fabric from the mill and had shifted production elsewhere for now  It said it had verified the steps Pacific Crystal had taken to remedy the situation after the spill    Fast Retailing is serious about running an ethical  sustainable business  and operates all supplier relationships under a strict code of conduct   spokesman Aldo Liguori said  Fast Retailing believed the dispute with farmers related to the initial terms of the sale of the land  he said  adding that neither it nor Pacific Crystal was involved in discussions  Villagers said the dispute with the local government over the sale of the land  which had been going on for more than a decade  was a separate issue    This is entirely about pollution   said Vinh  Pacific Textiles did not specify which customers it supplied from the factory but its website says it has relationships with brands including Calvin Klein and Victoria s Secret  The latter s owner  L Brands  NYSE LB   told Reuters no production for any of its brands came from the plant  Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp  NYSE PVH  did not respond to an emailed request for comment  Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  said it worked with both Crystal Group and Pacific Textiles  but did not source from or work with this plant  Attention to pollution in Vietnam has grown since last year  when a spill from a Formosa Plastics Group steel plant poisoned sea life along more than 200 km  125 miles  of coastline  prompting long running protests  The government has told companies they must meet environmental standards in order to stay in the country  The state has also shown a readiness to tackle environmental campaigners  whose protests have tested the limits of strict laws to limit criticism and maintain public order  One of Vietnam s most prominent bloggers  Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh  who is known by her pen name of Mother Mushroom  was jailed for 10 years this month for anti state propaganda     Additional reporting and writing by

177320,398836,GPS,Zacks com Highlights  PetMed Express  SINOPEC Shangai Petrochemical  NVR  Five Below And Gap,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 1  2018   Stocks in this week s article

Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 DuPont Tested Stocks for a Winning PortfolioIn a market that may see a correction any time thanks to central banks  moves and the consequent rising yields  geo political concerns and overvaluation issues  picking the right stock is a task  The metric return on equity goes a long way in resolving this issue The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity But to fine tune this basic concept  one can land on DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis  This theory will take investors a step higher and better pick some quality stocks   Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and

177361,398877,GPS,H M factory in Myanmar damaged in violent labor dispute,news,"By Shwe Yee Saw Myint and Yimou Lee YANGON  Reuters    Workers demanding better conditions and benefits have destroyed the production line of a Chinese owned factory making clothes for Swedish fashion retailer Hennes   Mauritz  in one of the most violent labor disputes in Myanmar in years  The month old dispute  which also saw managers attacked  highlights the need for Aung San Suu Kyi s government to enact social and labor reforms  analysts say  while at the same time reassuring investors looking to tap the opening of one of the world s fastest growing economies after decades of isolation  Production at Hangzhou Hundred Tex Garment  Myanmar  Company  which was one of H M s 40 suppliers in Myanmar  has been halted since Feb  9  workers and managers in the Chinese company said    H M group is deeply concerned about the recent conflict and our business relationship with this factory is on hold at the moment   the Swedish based company said in a statement  It declined to elaborate on the impact on its global supply chain    We are monitoring the situation closely and are in close dialogue with concerned parties  We strongly distance ourselves from all kind of violence   Labor activists say the protest in the commercial hub Yangon   in which equipment  buildings and vehicles were damaged   shows the lack of protection for workers in the labor intensive textile industry  The dispute started with a strike in late January following the sacking of a local labor union leader  according to workers and managers  Workers demanded a better performance review system and healthcare coverage   It turned violent on Feb  9  prompting the factory s closure  Video footage seen by Reuters shows dozens of female workers surrounding and beating a Chinese manager who was struggling to escape  One company manager and a local labor department official confirmed the authenticity of the footage  In late February hundreds of workers stormed the factory and damaged facilities including textile machinery  computers and surveillance cameras   The tension between workers and management was getting bigger day by day   said the company s former union leader That Paing Oo  who was fired in January for taking leave without approval   He had led a labor protest late last year that successfully pushed Hangzhou Hundred Tex Garment to compensate employees who did not receive overtime pay  several workers said  The company confirmed that it had paid a delayed overtime payment of 70 million kyat   51 736  to almost all of its 570 workers based on a settlement reached with the workers in December  The Chinese embassy in Myanmar described the incident as an  attack  and has filed a  serious request  to Myanmar government to hold those involved accountable   No one was arrested in the late February violence  police said  Workers  representatives are still negotiating with management over conditions once the factory is able to re open   The Chinese company makes garments such as skirts and shirts exclusively for H M  its assistant manager San Htwe told Reuters  He said the damage would cost around  75 000  and the company was planning to demand compensation from Myanmar s Labor Department  The conflict is troublesome for H M  which is widely seen as being at the forefront among large apparel companies in promoting workers  rights and fair wages  H M has called on governments in sourcing countries such as Cambodia and Bangladesh to ensure fair pay for workers  It has said it cannot unilaterally require individual suppliers raise wages as it generally shares them with other brands  although according to the owner that is not the case with the factory in this dispute            H M  which sources the bulk of its clothes in Asian low cost countries such as Bangladesh  Cambodia and Myanmar  generally ranks high in sustainability indexes such as the Corporate Knights magazine s Global 100 index  where in 2016 it ranked 20th  lagging only Adidas  DE ADSGN  in its sector  CATCHING UP Myanmar s fast growing textile industry  which employs more than 300 000 workers  has become attractive to global apparel brands such as H M and U S  retailer Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  following the easing of economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union  A minimum monthly wage of around  63  based on a six day work week  gives Myanmar a competitive advantage over neighboring garment producing hubs such as Vietnam and Cambodia  where the monthly minimum wage ranges from  90 to  145  according to the International Labor Organization   But labor activists and industry analysts say Suu Kyi s government  in office for almost a year  has to do more to ensure safety for workers as well as investment stability for employers in a country where strikes and protests are not uncommon   Industrial relations are still only a few years old in the Myanmar garment industry  and effective cooperative structures are still being developed   said Jacob Clere  who works on a European Union funded project to improve Myanmar s garment industry   The Ministry of Labor  Immigration and Population  which was involved in mediation between workers and employers of Hangzhou Hundred Tex Garment  said it was looking to amend laws to improve the legal framework for disputes   Maung Maung Lay  vice president of Myanmar s Chamber of Commerce  said investors needed to be patient    Being a late comer  there s a leap forward for Myanmar to catch up in terms of international

177431,398947,GPS,Fossil Group To Unveil New Brands On Wearables Platform,opinion,"Owing to the rising demand of smartwatches  Fossil Group Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   is now geared up to enrich its wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line up in 2018  These new brands will be powered by Google s Android Wear and will be compatible with both iOS and Android phones  Customers can personalize watch faces  create shortcuts to play music or monitor activity goals  These brands will add to the current portfolio of five brands   Diesel  Emporio Armani  Fossil  Michael Kors and Misfit   that will offer customers touchscreen smartwatches in fall 2017  Not only this  the company is also planning to roll out new hybrid smartwatches from Armani Exchange  Chaps  Emporio Armani  Diesel  DKNY  Fossil  kate spade new york  Marc Jacobs  Michael Kors  MICHELE  Misfit  Relic  Skagen and Tory Burch in stores during the fall and holiday season 
Notably  this global consumer fashion accessories maker has launched its 2017 touchscreen smartwatch line up earlier this year  having compatibility with both iOS and Android phones  Their designs featured full round AMOLED displays and were thinner  sleeker  comfortable to wear and found great appeal among female customers  Fossil Group seeks to launch more than 300 connected watch styles across 14 brands by the end of 2017 
Expansion in Wearable Space
Fossil Group has been expanding its wearables supported by Google s Android Wear since it first launched its Android Wear smartwatch in November 2015  In the last 12 months  Fossil Group doubled its distribution points for its connected devices and more than doubled its sales of wearables 
The introduction of wearable technology in watches has offered ample opportunity to the company to extend its reach of brands and offer customers new functionality with accessories  including activity trackers  hybrid watches and smart watches  Fossil Group s expansion in the wearable space is benefiting the company  as the company is getting the advantage of Android s popularity and Google s technology in its watches  The acquisition of Misfit in November 2015 has provided an opportunity to integrate Misfit s software and hardware platforms in the next generation of connected accessories  thereby advancing Fossil Group s connected accessories initiative further 
The company has also connected celebrities with the wearable brands to reintroduce customers to the Fossil brand  The company expects to increase its marketing spending by over 40  in fiscal 2017 on wearables to generate awareness for the new functionality available in these fashion first technology accessories 
Soft Sales in Traditional Watches Pose Headwinds
We note that this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches for a long time now due to increased competition  Rising demand for technology in watches have also dented the demand for traditional watches  Also  volatility in sales pattern is expected as consumer preferences evolve around the globe  Also  the success of the Michael Kors brand is overshadowing other brands  performance  Moreover  in January 2016  Burberry announced that it is exiting the watch business and does not intend to renew its license agreement upon its expiration at the end of 2017  has also hurt the company s business  The company continues to expect weakness in this category in the near term  Further  sales of leathers and jewelry have persistently been weak over the last few quarters  Decline in traditional watches and weak leather business also hurt sales in the Americas  Europe and Asia regions during the first half of 2017 Fossil Group  Inc  Revenue  Quarterly YoY Growth 
    Soft Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results
Fossil Group reported narrower than expected loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 on Aug 9  while sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  We note that the company has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine out of the last 11 straight quarters  including the current one  The watchmaker also provided a bleaker outlook and slashed its earnings  sales and operating income guidance  Adjusted loss of 23 cents per share was unfavorable from the last year s earnings of 9 cents per share  largely due to a decline in the top line  lower gross margin and currency headwinds  Though connected watches helped in growing the company s sales  overall net sales decreased 13  from the prior year quarter  primarily due to a decline in the company s multi brand licensed watch portfolio and challenging environment for the traditional watch category  Declines in leather and jewelry business as well as unfavorable currency also led to the decline 
Share Price Performance
If we analyze the last six months  performance of the company  we note that Fossil Group s shares have declined 54 5  as compared with the   which has declined around 26 4  in the said time frame  On the other hand  the broader  sector has gained 9 5  in the last six months 

Bottom Line
Though the company s watches category remains sluggish  we are impressed that the company s connected watches have helped in growing the company s sales  In fact  the company remains confident that wearables have the ability to help mitigate the ongoing softness in the traditional watch category  The company also focuses on the New World Fossil restructuring program along with growth in the company s core watch business and product expansion  Fossil Group is also looking to exit underperforming stores to generate savings and drive growth

177488,399004,GPS,Fossil Continues To Decline  Sluggish Watch Sales A Concern,opinion,"Fossil Group Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   has been disappointing investors of late due to the multiple headwinds plaguing the broader retail industry as well as continued weakness in traditional watches  If we analyze the last six months  performance of the company  we note that Fossil s shares have slumped 61 7  as compared with the  s 23 5  decline 
On the other hand  the broader  sector has gained 9 7  in the last six months  Notably  the industry is part of the top 45  of the Zacks Classified industries  118 out of the 265  

Let s take a look at the factors that is taking the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company downhill 
Weak Quarterly Performance  Estimates Going Down
Analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the last 7 days with estimates moving south  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at 73 cents  down from 93 cents per share in the said time frame  Similarly for 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined from  1 11 per share to 85 cents  over the same time frame 
Fossil recently reported narrower than expected loss in the  results  while sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Both losses and revenues were unfavorable from the year over year due to decline in traditional watches sales  sluggish leather and jewelry business as well as unfavorable currency  Further  this global consumer fashion accessories maker gave a bleaker outlook  Notably  the company s sales have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine out of the last 11 straight quarters 
Soft Watch Sales and Sluggish Leather Business
Fossil has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches since long time now  due to increased competition in the market  Rising demand for technology in watches have also dented the demand for traditional watches  Also  volatility in sales pattern is expected as consumer preferences evolve around the globe 
Also  the success of the Michael Kors brand is overshadowing other brands  performance  Moreover  the announcement of Burberry exiting the watch business in Jan 2016 has also hurt the company s business  as the brand will not renew its license agreement with Fossil upon its expiration at the end of 2017  The company continues to expect weakness in this category in the near term 
Further  sales of leathers have persistently been weak as customer response to the assortment continues to put pressure on results  Decline in traditional watches and weak leather business also hurt sales in the Americas  Europe and Asia regions during the first half of 2017 
Pressurized Margins
Fossil has been witnessing lower margins in the retail channel  primarily due to increased promotions to drive sales in the outlets and online as well as higher mix of connected products  which currently deliver lower margins  The company expects the trend to continue throughout the balance of the year 
Decelerating Growth in Key International Markets
Fossil is facing economic challenges in many of the key markets  In the first half of fiscal 2017  Americas  Europe and Asia declined due to decline in traditional watches and leathers business  primarily offset by connected watches  Modest growth in Spain was offset by declines in the UK and Middle East with both the wholesale and retail channels decreasing across the region  Growth in India and China was offset by a decline in Japan and Australia 
Other Headwinds
Fossil remains exposed to challenges relating to the rapid changing consumer shopping behaviors as well as unfavorable foreign currency translations for its products sourced internationally  Going forward  currency rate fluctuations are expected to hinder the company s sales and overall profitability  Fossil also remains susceptible to other economic challenges in many of its key markets  The company also faces the risk of import restrictions such as antidumping or countervailing duties  tariffs or other restrictions  as most of its products are manufactured overseas   Fossil Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Bottom Line
Though Fossil has been delivering sluggish results for a long time now  due to its factors affecting the broader retail industry  as well as continued weakness in traditional watches  we remain positive on the stock owing to its expansion in the wearable space  Keeping in mind the rising demand for technology in wrist wear  the company has planned to roll out a significant number of new wearable products in the coming months 
The company is also spending on marketing to build awareness for the new functionality available in these fashion first technology accessories  In fact  the company remains confident that wearables have the ability to help mitigate the ongoing softness in the traditional watch category  However  whether these ongoing initiatives will be able to spark a turnaround in the company s performance is a wait and watch story 
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the same space may consider some better ranked stocks like J C  Penney Company  Inc    NYSE JCP    Canada Goose Holdings Inc    NYSE GOOS   and The Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS    While J C  Penney sports a Zacks Rank  1  Canada Goose and Gap carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
While J C  Penney has an expected long term earnings growth of 16 0   Canada Goose and Gap have an expected earnings growth of 47 0  and 8 0   respectively  for the next three to five years 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

177544,399060,GPS,Is Gap  GPS  A Suitable Value Investment Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Gap has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 17  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 29 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock  the current level puts Gap s current PE among its lows over the past five years  This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its own historical levels and thus it could prove to be a suitable entry point from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 22  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  In fact  the stock has historically been undervalued than its peers over a major part of the observed period We should also point out that Gap has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 60   which is slightly higher than the current figure  This is because analysts expect earnings to decrease in 2017 PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Gap has a P S ratio of about 0 60  This is faintly higher than the Zacks categorized Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry average  which comes in at 0 57 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  GPS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Gap currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Gap a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 36  which is slightly better than the industry average of 7 43  Clearly  GPS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Gap might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives GPS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  Gap seems to have pretty striking prospects However  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to 10 lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward revisions and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a small but meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has moved south by 7 1   while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Gap  Inc   The  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGap is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 7  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Nevertheless  Gap remains committed to positioning itself better for long term growth by setting its priorities right and channelizing its resources accordingly  as is evident from its latest strategic plan  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth

177553,399069,GPS,U S  lifted Uzbekistan s rights ranking as cotton field abuses continued,news,"By Matt Spetalnick  Peter Eisler and Jason Szep SAMARKAND  Uzbekistan WASHINGTON  Reuters    The news reached Dmitry Tihonov in Uzbekistan s rural heartland as the labor activist quietly recorded the arrival of thousands of teachers  nurses  laborers  students and other conscripts sent to the fields to pick cotton  A fire had destroyed Tihonov s home office  When he returned to search the debris on Oct  29  his reports for international monitors documenting the annual mobilization had vanished  Human rights groups say Tihonov is a victim of Uzbekistan s efforts to conceal a massive  state orchestrated forced labor system that underpins its position as the world s fifth largest cotton exporter  They cite regular arrests  intimidation and harassment of activists  The activist from Angren  a town about 62 miles  100 km  east of the capital Tashkent  says he s under constant surveillance by local authorities to remind people  it s better to keep away from me    an allegation that Reuters could not independently confirm  Persecution of activists is among many abuses cited by witnesses and human rights groups that fueled discord in the Obama administration this year over how much criticism Central Asia s most populous nation deserved in the U S  State Department s annual report on modern slavery  In a previously undisclosed memo  analysts in the State Department s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons called forced labor  endemic  during the cotton harvest and said Uzbekistan had  failed to make significant and sustained efforts  to improve its record  The early 2015 memo  reviewed by Reuters  recommended keeping Uzbekistan in the lowest tier of the report s rankings  raising the specter of economic sanctions on a country whose cotton is used in yarn and fabric that play a significant role in the global supply chain  But senior U S  diplomats rejected the recommendation  downplaying concerns about human rights in a strategically important country  The landlocked nation of deserts  mountains and steppes was a transit point for U S  troops and supplies during the war in neighboring Afghanistan  Washington now wants its help preventing the spread of Islamic militants  stabilizing Afghanistan and offsetting Russian influence in the region  When the State Department issued its 2015 Trafficking in Persons  TIP  Report in July  Uzbekistan was elevated from the bottom tier of violators  Uzbekistan doesn t meet  minimum standards  to end trafficking  the report said  but it is  making significant efforts    a caveat absent from the analysts  assessment  Uzbekistan s government makes an estimated  1 billion a year from cotton sales  and the harvest mobilizations of roughly a million people that date to Soviet times are characterized as a patriotic duty  Uzbek officials did not answer repeated requests for comment but generally argue that citizens pick cotton voluntarily  A Reuters examination   based on interviews with local officials  activists and workers in the fields   found that while the country has made progress ending child labor in the harvest  it has intensified recruitment of adults and older teenagers using the same coercive approach  The State Department s decision to rebuff its experts  recommendation and upgrade Uzbekistan s rating in the trafficking report reinforces a Reuters article in August that said senior diplomats inflated assessments of 14 strategically important countries in the annual review  including the central Asian country  The yearly review is meant to independently grade countries on trafficking and forced labor  Despite Uzbekistan s progress barring children from the fields   I don t see any evidence that this very fundamental form of coercive labor has changed   says former U S  ambassador at large Mark Lagon  who headed the State Department s anti trafficking office from 2007 2009  Uzbekistan still has a  miserable human rights profile   Asked for comment  a State Department official defended Uzbekistan s upgrade  saying the department stands by  the integrity of the process  for determining country rankings   Are they still mobilizing workers  Yes   said a senior official who accompanied Secretary of State John Kerry on a Nov  1 visit to Uzbekistan  But  if you don t show recognition of improved behavior  on child labor   you risk them deciding it s not worth the effort and then doing nothing   STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE U S  policymakers have struggled for two decades to balance concern about Uzbekistan s human rights record with the need to maintain relations with hard line President Islam Karimov   It s a natural geopolitical alliance but it s complicated because of his human rights record   says John Herbst  U S  ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2000 2003   His authoritarian regime is not very consistent with our principles   Speaking to reporters before his November meeting with Karimov in the ancient Silk Road city of Samarkand  Kerry spoke of  shared interests   especially combating Islamic extremism  but his references to human rights were oblique  He noted a need to address  the human dimension  of Uzbek governance  Reuters was unable to determine whether they discussed forced labor in their private meeting  Uzbekistan took initial steps to bar children from picking cotton in 2012 and the effort expanded in 2013  when the State Department downgraded the country in the trafficking report to the  Tier 3    the lowest rank shared by North Korea and a few other countries  In last year s report  Uzbekistan remained at Tier 3  and its prohibitions on child labor grew more stringent  But the dearth of child workers led to increased conscription of adults and older teens  according to a dozen witnesses of the harvest interviewed by Reuters  Still facing the same government imposed harvesting quotas  local authorities expanded mobilizations of public employees  such as teachers  nurses and bureaucrats  as well as private sector workers  the witnesses said  While young  school age children were not forcibly mobilized on a mass scale  many 17 year olds were coerced along with some younger children in the later weeks of the harvest to meet quotas  they added   NO WAY OF REFUSING  A dozen workers interviewed by Reuters in September all requested anonymity  saying they feared retribution  Among them  a plumber  46  said he was bused 250 km  155 miles  to pick cotton for 15 days  When he returned  another group of employees went out  Food and lodging were provided in dilapidated barracks   There was no way of refusing   he said  A pensioner  64  said each household in her town was directed to send a volunteer to pick cotton  She feared those that didn t would be  on the black list  and lose public benefits  Because her son runs a small shop that supports the family  she went to the fields herself  A history teacher  49  said staff at her school were told to pick cotton for 20 days or pay the equivalent of about  400 each to support the harvest  She refused and  facing termination  resigned  Reuters was unable to independently confirm these accounts  BACK IN WASHINGTON  DC  The State Department s human rights analysts lacked support this year as they pushed to keep Uzbekistan at the bottom of the rankings  according to congressional sources  and current and former U S  officials  The trafficking office s director had left  and the department brought in a retired diplomat as acting director for a few months while rankings were decided  Patricia Butenis  former ambassador to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh  opposed the analysts on Uzbekistan  according to officials involved  leaving them without high level advocacy  At a meeting that included the U S  ambassador to Uzbekistan  Butenis pushed for the country to be upgraded against the recommendation of the analysts she represented  the sources said  She urged the analysts to consider what she described as the  big picture  implications of keeping Uzbekistan at Tier 3  they added  The State Department declined to discuss  internal deliberations   An official noted that country rankings ultimately are decided by the secretary of state  based  solely  on staff input  Butenis  now retired  declined comment  Uzbekistan s Tier 3 ranking in the 2013 and 2014 reports helped a coalition of human rights groups  the Cotton Campaign  organize a boycott of Uzbek cotton by more than 200 apparel manufacturers and retailers  including Gap Inc  N GPS    American Eagle Outfitters   N AEO  Inc and Wal Mart Stores Inc   N WMT   American Eagle said it had no plans to change a ban on using Uzbek cotton it has had in place since 2008  Gap and Wal Mart did not immediately respond to requests for comment   The U S  upgrade of Uzbekistan has not changed the boycott  said Patricia Jurewicz  director of Responsible Sourcing Network  an advocacy group in California that maintains a list of companies that have pledged  to not knowingly  source Uzbek cotton until the country  ends the practice of forced child and adult labor in its cotton sector   But big cotton processors such as Singapore s Olam International Ltd and South Korea s Daewoo International Corp  still buy Uzbek cotton  the companies said  Olam said it could not answer specific queries on Uzbek cotton  but added it was working with the government and other bodies to address labor issues  
Because of weakness in the global economy  demand for Daewoo s Uzbek cotton has weakened  a Daewoo company spokesman told Reuters  He declined to comment on the country s forced labor conditions but welcomed Uzbekistan s upgrade in the trafficking report as  definitely good  ",2015-12-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-lifted-uzbekistan's-rights-ranking-as-cotton-field-abuses-continued-377297,377297

177561,399077,GPS,Amid Buyout Whispers  Should Lululemon  LULU  Finally Sell ,opinion,"Shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc    NASDAQ LULU   have plummeted since the beginning of the year as the once powerful  athleisure wear  maker faces continued uncertainty  Is it finally time for the company to strongly consider a sale 
Today s Movement
Lululemon s stock was up 0 81  to  52 11 per share in afternoon trading on Tuesday  and there is one reason the struggling yoga wear company might be up today   
But even if this chatter is nothing more than that  should the Canadian athletic wear giant with a market cap of  7 13 billion think about finally diving headfirst into a sale after years of buyout speculation 
Potential Buyout
While shoppers have expressed concern about Lululemon s product quality and pricing  the biggest reason why Lulu s stock price has been so volatile since 2013 is that the sector the company operates in has gone through a massive change over this same period 
As retail becomes much harder to survive in  Lululemon has been in  when the company was trading at  38 47 per share 
Lululemon went on a massive run from early 2009 until May 2013  Over that period  the Canadian company saw its stock price rise from  2 86 per share to an all time high of  77 81 per share  Since then  its stock has gone through ebbs and flows like much of the rest of the retail sector 
The Vancouver based company  which sells luxury athletic wear items like yoga pants and running shorts for both men and women  cornered a niche market of upscale athletic clothing  Lululemon s success spawned competitors in the athleisure market  such as The Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   s   BK THE   Athleta and celebrity based brands by Kate Hudson and Carrie Underwood 
Lululemon s fourth quarter earnings report fell short of analyst estimates  and although the company posted some impressive growth metrics  its stock price still plummeted 
And the latest round of acquisition speculation comes after luxury retailer Coach Inc    NYSE COH   officially announced its  of rival Kate Spade   NYSE KATE   yesterday  Coach  the larger and older brand  bought a rival that it will likely allow to operate on its own  The move is set to help both survive in today s retail climate 
Could the same be done with Lululemon 
While athletic apparel giants Nike   NYSE NKE    Adidas AG   NYSE ADS   stock  and Under Armour   NYSE UAA    all look to grow  buying Lululemon and letting it stand alone as its own brand might be what both parties need 
However  the latest rumors seem to imply that Lululemon is in talks with a private equity firm  so perhaps the company moving back into the private sphere would ease pressure as well

177576,399092,GPS,Coach s Strategic Endeavors Bode Well  Should You Hold ,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying or holding stocks that offer solid prospects and have enough potential for growth  Here we have discussed one such stock  Coach  Inc    NYSE COH   with an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 10 6   The company has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around its products  stores and marketing to pull itself back on the growth trajectory and emerge as a multi brand company  So far in the year  the stock has advanced roughly 16  
Growth Drivers
As one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts  Coach boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance their sales output through product innovation  a compelling pricing strategy  new merchandise assortments and a cost effective global sourcing model  We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable store sales and operating margins in the long term  The company s growth drivers include expansion of its global distribution model and venturing into under penetrated markets 
Coach is undergoing a brand transformation and is introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets  The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman has been accretive to its performance and is being viewed as a significant step in its efforts toward becoming a multi brand company  Further  the company remains optimistic about its dual gender Legacy lifestyle collection  dedicated men s stores and international growth opportunities  Additionally  it is aggressively expanding its eCommerce platform 
The company s strategic endeavors helped it post 11th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise when it reported first quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein both the top and bottom line grew year over year  Moreover  Coach registered positive comparable store sales at its North American segment for the second straight quarter 
The company s international operations also witnessed robust growth  Management now projects low to mid single digits increase in revenue and double digit growth in earnings per share during fiscal 2017  Further  the company expects operating margin between 18 5  and 19  for the fiscal year COACH INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Obstacles to Overcome
Coach sells products that are discretionary in nature and consequently depends upon consumers  disposable income  which is sensitive to macroeconomic factors  Further  fashion obsolescence remains the main concern for the company s business model  which involves a sustained focus on product and design innovation 
Furthermore  the company generates a significant amount of net sales outside the U S  Due to high exposure to international markets the company remains susceptible to currency fluctuations  The weakening of foreign currencies against the U S  dollar may require it to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the U S  An increase in price may have an adverse impact on the demand for its products 
Given the pros and cons embedded  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

In the hour  the stock broke the until then valid upward trend when it broke through the market at 34 euros in the in mid June  and since then it has been trendless  In the mid term  a fresh upward trend has formed  which will remain intact as long as the value does not fall under 27 31 euros 
Since July  the stock has been displaying a small subordinate downward trend that merely represents the regression of the upward trend  The experienced trader should wait with his or her long entry until the market is located at around 28 euros 
In addition  one could choose a catastrophe entry at approx  32 20  which should be trailed behind downwards  One should take into account  however  the fact that the value is very bearish in the day chart  and will only be broken when the 43 41 euro marker of the downward trend is exceeded  For this reason  stops should be trailed tightly and first profits at 34 euros should be picked up 

CH Robinson Worldwide Inc  NASDAQ CHRW  Due to obvious  extreme divergences  there is a real chance for a short trade in this value  The second correction  as well as a price that is far into the correction zone  bring hope that it may well go downwards once more  With a stop sell order at approx   70 50  one can speculate on a continuation of the trend 
If it wants to go upwards  we have a chance to enter even higher up  and the risk is reduced even further  With the right money management  the technically correct stop is located above the red box  A first possible target would be located at  66 62 

Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  is the largest US clothing retailer  Gap has its headquarters in San Francisco  California  Since October 2014  however  the stock is in difficulties  and has halved its value  In the large timeframe in the daily basis  there is still a valid downward trend that will remain upheld until the marker at  30 49 is broken through 
From the mid term perspective  in the hour we have an upward trend that has arrived at the end of its correction zone  When the marker at  23 82 is undercut  this trend will be broken too  The RSI is currently in the oversold area  if the market goes upwards once more and then forms divergences  a long entry at around  24 20 is recommended 
The first profits should be picked up at around  27

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 57 cents on  3 80 billion in revenue  1 cent lower than Wall Street on the bottom line and nearly  15 million on the top
Gap has already indicated that net sales and comparables sales were down for the second quarter
Rising popularity of fast fashion trends and increasing competition from online retailers have put pressure on sales  specifically in mall based stores
Gap is scheduled to report second quarter earnings today  after the market closes  Despite the broader surge from retailers this season don t expect Gap to be apart of that lively trend  The clothing retailer typically pre releases its sales metrics leaving very little surprise on the actual report date  For the second quarter  net sales and comparable sales were down compared to a year earlier 
Earnings are expected in the range of 58 to 59 cents for the quarter  That compares with Estimize estimates that are calling for earnings of 57 cents per share  or 15  below the year earlier  Shockingly  per share estimates have jumped 16  since Gap s most recent report in May 

Investors looking for a turnaround this quarter may need to wait a bit longer  Net sales for the quarter were reported down to  3 85 billion compared with  3 90 billion last year  Overall comparable sales for the second quarter were down 2   This includes a 3  decline in its namesake Gap brand  a 9  drop from Banana Republic and flat Old Navy sales  Shares are still up 44  in the past 3 months
The biggest problems have been the rising popularity of fast fashion and online retailers  Gap has been unable to revise its product portfolio in a way that is consistent with current fashion trends and customers changing preferences  Meanwhile  mall traffic  where most of it stores are located  continue to dwindle  Customer are simply choosing to spend their time elsewhere over their local mall  Based on the way things are going in the retail space  a small surprise could send the stock soaring  Do you think GPS can beat estimates ",2016-08-18,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-this-specialty-retailer-surprise-investors-200148688,200148688

177658,399174,GPS,Uniqlo expects profit at U S  stores in  couple of years ,news," Reuters    Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo aims to turn a profit at its small but expanding U S  network of stores within the next couple of years  the company s top U S  executive  Larry Meyer  said 
Well known in its home country for its inexpensive but trendy down jackets  jeans and undergarments  Uniqlo   short for  Unique Clothing    is a relative newcomer in the United States 
It opened its first flagship store in New York City s chic Soho neighborhood in 2006  With the addition this week of a new location in Wayne  New Jersey  the company   owned by the world s fourth largest fashion retailer  Fast Retailing Co   now operates 26 U S  stores 
And the company plans to boost that number by 50 percent to 39 outlets by mid November  Meyer  chief executive officer of Uniqlo USA  told Reuters 
Still  Uniqlo s ambitious roll out plan has yet to earn a profit in the U S   at least in part because of high opening costs 
 We are investing in building our brand and building stores  that includes building a workforce that is capable of handling the road we are putting in place   Meyer said 
He was optimistic that the U S  operation was  on the way to getting  profitable  within the next couple of years  
Fast Retailing has provided few details on this topic  and has said for the past few years merely that the U S  business would emerge from the red  soon  
    The retailer plans to have 200 Uniqlo stores in the United States by 2020  part of a broader push to become the world s top fashion retailer  Its competitors include Spain s Inditex  which owns the Zara chain  Sweden s Hennes   Mauritz  known as H M  and Gap Stores Inc  
Fast Retailing s website said there were more than 1 400 Uniqlo locations worldwide  including more than 850 in Japan and more than 300 in China 
After mid November  when the company will have 39 outlets in the U S   the chain intends to open 10 to 15 locations a year  Meyer said 
     We will be building revenue consistent with what 200 stores would generate   Meyer said 
    He said that some new stores will have the bigger flagship format and that e commerce would make a contribution 
Building U S  brand awareness was a big challenge  Meyer said  and sizing was another sticky issue  
Uniqlo has had to adjust its sizing by  scaling up  to fit the U S  market  meaning a  medium  jacket in a Tokyo store may be a  small  in New York  The company is still looking into all sizing technology  he said 

In the short term  Uniqlo plans to open additional locations in Boston and Los Angeles next spring  and its first Chicago store next fall

The 39 year old former tour guide  university dropout and son of a mechanic is one of the biggest success stories in a country that was for years Southeast Asia s war torn  aid dependant basket case 
Though poverty is still rife in the countryside  an urban boom and robust growth fueled by garment manufacturing for brands such as Nike  N NKE  and GAP  N GPS  has given rise to a growing consumer class that earns triple the average income 
 We see there s a lot more buying power than before   said Chy Sila as he took a bite from a croissant and sipped cappuccino at one of the bakeries run by his CBM Corporation  Cambodia s biggest food and beverage firm 
 People can afford to pay so now s the time  we re ready for big brands to come here    Materialism is in peoples  hearts  what you wear  what you drive  represents what you are  
With a fast growing working population and falling dependency ratio  Cambodia has the demographics most favorable to rapid economic growth 
Young Cambodians now buy smartphones  flat screen TVs and Japanese motorcycles  They tap banks for loans and credit cards and are fuelling the kind of capitalist culture the 1970s ultra Maoist Khmer Rouge killed 2 million people to prevent 
Aeon plans more malls in Cambodian cities and operates a microfinance firm so shoppers can buy on payment plans  Its new mall  boasting shops from the likes of Mango  Levi s and Versace  drew 100 000 visitors daily when it opened in June

Chy Sila was born the same year the Khmer Rouge swept to power and says he lost  countless  relatives to Pol Pot s genocidal pursuit for a peasant utopia 
Today s capitalist Cambodia  with an economy that averaged 8 1 percent growth from 2000 2012 and expanded 7 4 percent last year  according to the World Bank  is a far cry from what the Khmer Rouge envisioned when it abolished money and property ownership  executed entrepreneurs and blew up the central bank 
Forty years after the population of Phnom Penh were emptied into labor camps  the city is swelling  with malls  office towers  hotels and fast food chains popping up rapidly 
Modern SUVs  and even the occasional Lamborghini or Porsche  cruise its once potholed streets 
The World Bank says the country of 15 million people is a top global performer in tackling poverty  having cut the ratio of poor from 53 percent of its population in 2004 to 20 percent in 2011 
Foreign direct investment has grown  from  2 65 billion recorded in 2007 to as high as  10 8 billion in subsequent years  according to Cambodia s investment board 
There s now a small stock market and the number of banks has nearly doubled since a decade ago  with 35 commercial lenders providing  9 5 billion in loans since records started  Cambodia s Credit Bureau expects that to surpass  14 billion by 2020 and credit demand to almost double to 3 3 million people 
The average bank loan in 2004 was  3 895  about a fifth of last year s average of  19 096  according to Acleda Bank  Cambodia s biggest lender 
 Loans are good for young people like me   said Hour Veasna  20  as he signed up for financing from Aeon to buy a  600 camera  equivalent to five months salary   We don t have enough money to purchase things that we want  
WEALTH GAP
In the first half of 2014  bank deposits grew 13 percent and loans to the private sector were up 28 percent  central bank Governor Chea Chanto said in a recent speech  Three million Cambodians use banks to deposit money  up 18 percent from last year  with about 600 000 users of credit or debit cards 
But there are still plenty of Cambodians who don t have such privileges and Chy Sila says he s saddened by the yawning gap between rich and poor  He raises money to send children to school and has cultivated an image as a humble entrepreneur  driving a Ford SUV rather than luxury cars such as Rolls Royce  which entered the local market in June 
The new found opulence of Phnom Penh can leave a sour taste in the mouths of those who struggle to get basic services in Cambodia  where hospitals are overwhelmed and average annual income is  950   or  2 60 a day   nearly half that of Vietnam and a fifth of Thailand 

 Economic growth is only for the city   said rice farmer Heang Samnang  waiting with her sick daughter at the city s foreign funded Kantha Bopha Hospital  which provides free treatment to millions of poor   In rural areas  there s no development  we just work on farms

177661,399177,GPS,Fashion chain Gap in deal with online retailer Zalando,news,"By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    Gap Inc  N GPS  has struck a deal with Europe s largest dedicated online fashion retailer Zalando  DE ZALG  to sell its core brand from next May  hoping to reach more consumers  particularly in markets where it has no physical stores 
The U S  company already delivers to 24 European countries from its own website and has more than 200 stores on the continent but is not present on the ground in key markets such as Germany 
Berlin based Zalando  which listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange last month  started out selling shoes in 2008 and now ships 1 500 brands to customers in 15 European countries  with Britain s Top Shop one of its latest big name additions 
 Many customers in Europe still don t have access to the Gap brand   Zalando co founder David Schneider told Reuters   We offer a platform to enter 15 markets in local languages  in local currency  with free shipments  returns and so on  
Gap  which runs more than 3 500 stores worldwide  is trying to reduce its dependence on the highly competitive North American market and plans to open 40 stores in India at the same time as it strengthens in e commerce 
Digital business head Art Peck is due to take over as chief executive next February after his division s sales grew 21 percent in the 2013 financial year to  2 3 billion  6 percent of total sales 
Gap s bigger European rivals Inditex  MC ITX  and H M  ST HMb  are also investing in e commerce but are focusing on their own sites and are not listed on Zalando 
 We have to be where are customers are  Zalando is the most visited fashion e commerce site in Europe   said Stefan Laban  responsible for Gap s business in Europe and Japan   We want to be one of the biggest brands on the site  
E commerce could grow to 30 percent of total German fashion sales by 2020  from 14 percent in 2012  according to consultancy firm Strategy  
While the Zalando deal is focused on the main Gap brand  Laban said the company coul look later to extend it to other lines such as Old Navy 
Zalando  which increased first half sales by 29 5 percent to 1 047 billion euros   1 3 billion   reports third quarter figures on Wednesday

Gap in Focus
The Gap  Inc  is a global specialty retailer which operates stores selling casual apparel  personal care and other accessories for men  women and children under the Gap  Banana Republic and Old Navy brands 
Gap met expectations in its Q1 2016 earnings report  posting an EPS that was equal to the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
GPS has an average EPS surprise of 0  for the last four quarters  In Q2  Q3  and Q4 2015  GPS met each respective Zacks Consensus Estimate GAP INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   
Heading into this earnings report  our Most Accurate Estimate forGap is  0 59  the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Like other retailers  GAP has stagnated due to a stronger U S  dollar and slow adjustment to fashion trend shifts 
On August 8th  GAP released their July 2016 and second quarter sales results  The company reported a  20 million year over year net sales decrease to  1 1 billion  along with a four percent decrease in comparable sales in July  compared to a three percent decrease at the same point last year  
GAP subsidiary Banana Republic has been the biggest loser  seeing a nine percent decrease in comparable sales results in Q2  compared to a four percent loss last year  Old Navy  which had been GAP s redeeming factor in recent quarters  has seen flat comparable sales growth in Q2  compared to a three percent increase last year  
The company has closed down a notable chunk of its locations in recent years  announcing in June of 2015 that it would close a quarter of its stores  and then announcing in May of this year that it would close another 75 stores by the end of fiscal year 2016

GPS is seeing little movement in after hours trading  down around 0 89  as of 4 42 PM EST 
Comparable sales for each of Gap s three main brands were weak  but to be expected  Gap Global saw a decrease of 3  versus a decrease of 6  in the prior year  Old Navy Global comps were flat this quarter  a decline from last year s gain of 3   Banana Republic Global reported the most disappointing comps overall  declining 9  versus a decrease of 4  last year 
Gap reported Q2 operating expenses of  1 16 billion  with marketing expenses totaling  131 million 
 During the quarter  we took critical steps to execute our restructuring plans and to build a more efficient global brand model with greater potential for growth   said Art Peck  CEO of Gap 
 While I remain unsatisfied with the pace of improvement across the business  I am encouraged by the underlying signs of progress in Q2  as demonstrated by healthier merchandise margins  Our management teams share my urgency to create fundamental change that will drive long term performance   he continued 
Looking ahead  Gap now expects full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of  1 87 to  1 92  Adjusted operating margin is now forecasted to be about 8 5  in the full fiscal year 
Should You Buy GPS Stock 
Beating top and bottom line estimates and by only a slim margin seemed to be the only bright spot in Gap s second quarter performance  but its weak comparable store sales should not come as a surprise  Gap has been failing to win over its once devoted customer base for years now  especially at its namesake and Banana Republic brands 
Despite continued negative quarterly performance  Gap is taking critical steps in order to turn its businesses around  but it definitely needs to step up its game  Product at its three core brands desperately needs to improve  as it s continually missing the mark with its customers 
It s Athleta division  a women s and girl s athleisure retailer  has the potential to be a big money maker for the company  Similar in style to Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU    its product is on trend and fashionable  something its other brands have trouble executing  Gap should continue to market and expand Athleta 
In terms of estimate revision activity  Gap has actually seen some positive changes  For the next quarter  three analysts have revised upwards while 5 have revised downwards  and its current fiscal year has seen 13 positive revisions within the last 30 days  Make sure to watch out for these revisions in the near future  especially in the next few days  Currently  GPS is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

177691,399207,GPS,Across Asia s borders  labor activists team up to press wage claims,news,"By Eveline Danubrata and Prak Chan Thul JAKARTA PHNOM PENH  Reuters    Labor leaders behind the biggest strikes in Cambodia s  5 billion garment industry knew last year they had a strong case for higher wages  they had already compared notes with activists in neighboring countries 
The result was a 25 percent increase in the minimum pay for an estimated 600 000 garment workers  to  100 a month  the biggest jump in around 15 years  Now  they re asking for more 
Negotiations over pay and working conditions have typically remained within national borders  but activists are now bringing more muscle to the table and putting more pressure on employers and governments by using shared experiences in nearby markets 
For global companies that have shifted production to Southeast Asia s low cost manufacturing hub  this could mean less room for wage bargaining  a squeeze on profits and maybe even higher price tags on anything from shoes and clothing to cars and electronics appliances 
 I see a trend towards more and stronger collaboration among labor leaders that can take different shapes and forms  from exchanging information to partnerships   said Peter van Rooij  director of the International Labor Organization  ILO  in Jakarta  noting ties would likely strengthen with next year s planned economic integration by the 10 member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  
Thousands of workers in China  Indonesia and Cambodia have protested in recent months at local firms supplying U S  sportswear company Nike Inc to press for better pay and conditions  Up to 4 000 workers at Sabrina  Cambodia  Garment Manufacturing Co  which makes clothes for Nike  went on strike in May last year demanding higher wages to keep pace with transport  rent and healthcare costs 
HOTEL LOBBY
Across Asia s low cost garment manufacturing industry in particular  there have been more strikes as unions use a shortage of skilled workers to press for better pay and improved safety   an issue highlighted by the April 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh  which killed at least 1 130 people 
Members of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia  GMAC  have reported a jump in the number of strikes to 147 last year from fewer than three dozen in 2011  Other international brands hit by protests at Cambodia based suppliers last year include H M Hennes and Mauritz AB  Wal Mart Stores Inc  Gap Inc and Puma SE 
Following the Bangladesh disaster  local unions reached out to international labor representatives  said Annie Adviento  director of IndustriALL s Southeast Asia office  helping create the landmark Accord on Fire and Building Safety   a legally binding agreement signed by more than 150 apparel firms and the unions that requires factories to have independent safety inspections with the results made public 
IndustriALL  which represents 50 million workers in 140 countries worldwide  said it arranges meetings two to three times a month to bring together labor activists from across Asia  something that was rarely done before last year 
 Issues are not being kept secret at the national level anymore  The capacity of the unions to share information has improved   said Adviento   We re doing many exchanges this year as we found they are very effective and we intend to continue in 2015   she said  adding Cambodia and Bangladesh have been  high profile cases  for the global labor union 
 We communicate with each other and we give duties to this international union to lobby in asking for pay rises   said Chea Mony  president of the Phnom Penh based Free Trade Union 
Said Iqbal  who heads the Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions  with more than 1 4 million members  said he has been invited to Malaysia  Vietnam  Cambodia and Laos to share his experiences with other activists 
 Our motto is clear   say no to cheap wages  We re spreading that principle in Southeast Asian countries   he told Reuters 
Iqbal said the meetings arranged by IndustriALL can be seminars for up to 50 people  or gatherings drawing a group of labor leaders from several countries to a hotel in one of the region s capitals  where they compare minimum wages and talk about social security and other labor related issues 
 We re trying to spread the principle of  concept  lobby  action    said the 46 year old  recalling how he became involved in labor activism to fight the kind of poverty that forced his mother to sell cakes to fellow workers in a Jakarta textile factory just to make ends meet 
 That probably took root in my mind and heart  A person can work for decades for one company and still remain poor  I felt a call to really fight at the labor unions   he said 
UNION INFLUENCE
When negotiating with the GMAC and the Cambodian government  unions have drawn on examples from other Asian countries such as Thailand   which last year brought in a national daily minimum wage of 300 baht   9 42    said Pav Sina  president of the Collective Union Movement of Workers 
While the GMAC agreed to gradually raise the monthly minimum pay to  160 by 2018  the unions   which have power and influence over Cambodia s economy   are pushing for  177 a month and have threatened more strikes  Pav Sina told Reuters 
In Jakarta  capital of Southeast Asia s largest economy  the minimum monthly wage has jumped around 60 percent to 2 4 million rupiah   205 30  over the last two years  partly due to intense lobbying by labor activists  That compares to 1 820 yuan   295 79  a month in Shanghai   the highest in China  once the world s  cheap factory  
Even as wages rise  labor activists are confident they aren t at risk of pricing themselves out of the market  Arief Budiman  President Director of consultancy PT  McKinsey Indonesia  says global firms recognize Asia s  market opportunity  and expanding consumer base 
 Companies have threatened to move out of Indonesia  but I think that s just an empty threat   said Wahidin  an official at the Indonesian Muslim Workers Brotherhood   The reality is that few have closed  and in fact more want to expand here  
In an emailed statement  Nike said it takes a  long term approach  to sourcing decisions   it has contract factories in 44 countries   and is always looking to improve its supply chain  through increased productivity and efficiency

177713,399229,GPS,Cambodia Ups Arrests Of Garment Worker Activists ,news,"By    Two Cambodian youths are facing 11 years in prison for throwing rocks at police during one of the country s recent clashes between security forces and workers who make clothes carried by some of the largest Western retail outlets  including major buyers like Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   Hennes   Mauritz AB  ST HMb  and Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT  
Vanny Vannan  believed to be 18 or 19  and Meas Nun  a minor who works collecting scrap metal on the streets of Phnom Penh  are scheduled to have their verdict read before a judge on May 30  Meas is developmentally disabled  while Vanny was wrongfully arrested  human rights activists have said 
 The Cambodian authorities should be prosecuting the unnecessary use of lethal force by security forces instead of trying to convict a misidentified young man and a teenage boy with a disability   Brad Abrams  Asia director of Washington D C  based Human Rights Watch  said in a statement published on the group s website on Sunday 
The two youths have become the international focus of a rash of recent violent confrontations between angry garment industry workers and their supporters  The workers say they need to be paid higher than the current  68 a month minimum wage and require better working conditions and benefits  The issue echoes similar problems happening 1 800 miles to the northwest of Phnom Penh in Bangladesh  which has been in the media spotlight for more than a year over its dangerous garment factories 
Cambodia  where 11 labor activist have been detained over the past month  nine of them last week  has been facing a rise in labor unrest since November  when soldiers opened fire with machine guns on protesters during a nationwide strike  killing a rice selling bystander and injuring 20 others  The 11 facing charges join at least 21 individuals who ve been arrested since January  not including the two youths facing prison 
Ath Thorn  head of a local apparel workers union  and another union member were charged with inciting violence during a protest last month against SL Garment Processing  Cambodia  Ltd   which supplies garments to companies including Banana Republic and the Gap  A judge slapped the two with  25 000 in bail  a princely sum in a country where the average annual income is  750 

In a separate incident  three union representatives in Kandal province were arrested Friday amid a strike involving about 4 000 workers of Quint Major Industrial Co  Ltd   a maker and supplier of pants  jackets and sportswear  The walkout occurred April 22  and recently hundreds of Quint workers have started picketing the company facilities 
 They were protesting to demand workers receive a base wage of  160  a month  and better working conditions   Sok Ravuth  president of the Free Union Federation of Khmer Labour  told The Phnom Penh Post in a report published on Tuesday 
The Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia  the main trade group for the employers  accuses the demonstrators of violent tactics and has posted on its website a collage of videos making its case   
In another recent incident  six union workers were detained by authorities during a strike against Wing Star Shoes Co  Ltd  factory  which was targeted this month because workers say the management had not lived up to a previously agreed upon deal for a 50 cents per day meal subsidy and a  5 a month health care bonus 
Last year  part of the Wing Star factory roof collapsed  killing two workers  Japanese footwear company Asics Corp  TYO 7936   which owns the factory  agreed to pay an undisclosed amount in compensation to the families of the deceased workers and others who were injured 
The government views these rash of strikes as subverting the public peace and have answered with bullets  In January  soldiers opened fire with automatic weapons into crowds of workers participating in a national industry wide work stoppage 

The workers have rejected the government s call to raise the minimum monthly wage to  95  which is less than the  160 the unions are demanding  The U K  based Labour Behind the Label and the Phnom Penh based Community Legal Education Centre estimate that workers need about  150 a month to cover the basic cost of living in Cambodia  Cambodia s garment  textile and shoe industry is dwarfed by Bangladesh s  but it s the primary export for the impoverished Southeast Asian country 
It s the lifeblood for about a half million workers    most of whom are women    and the goods are supplied mainly to the United States thanks to a most favored nation trade status  Many workers are internal migrants who spend about  10 to  25 traveling to and from their villages each month ",2014-05-13,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/cambodia-ups-arrests-of-garment-worker-activists-283987,283987

choppy trading on Thursday  helped by jobless claims and
same store sales data  but technical resistance to further
gains was strong 
 The S P 500 closed Wednesday above a key technical level
and its ability to hold above 1 333 58 will be tested at the
close  The level is double the cycle low hit in March 2009 and
is near a recent 2 1 2 year high of about 1 344  which could
become yet another technical hurdle 
  There is an extreme level of bullishness  so there is an
argument to make that the boat is already full   said Peter
Boockvar  equity strategist at Miller Tabak   Co in New York 
  The market is dealing with a lot of uncertainty near the
highs  either we break through or we fail  and when you get
that situation we see this kind of hesitancy

 LONDON  May 20  Reuters    BP  boosted by a contribution to

analyst comment helped drive Britain s FTSE 100 index higher on
Friday  but concerns over weak buying momentum capped gains

Macondo well  had agreed to pay the UK oil major  1 1 billion

 Shares in clothing retailer Gap Inc  fell 16 percent
to  19 60 after it slashed its full year profit outlook late on
Thursday  saying higher price tags will not be enough to offset
rising cotton costs 
 But Barnes   Noble Inc  shares rose 29 3 percent at

proposed buying the company for  1 02 billion  The largest U S 
bookstore chain put itself up for sale nine months ago 
 U S  stocks ended higher on Thursday but the S P 500 ran
into resistance after its recent bounce  and many investors
expect a patch of economic weakness over the summer  The 1 340
level on the S P has met with repeated bouts of selling 
  In the near term  the weakness below 1 340 is definitely
pressuring the market to the downside more   said Kurt Brunner

   BP gains as Mitsui pays to settle oil spill claim
 
 By Harpreet Bhal
 LONDON  May 20  Reuters    European shares fell on Friday 
with investors reducing their exposure to riskier assets as
concerns over the euro zone debt crisis intensified after
ratings agency Fitch downgraded Greece s credit rating 
 Traders said a lack of positive drivers in the market pushed
buyers to the sidelines  while confidence remained fragile ahead
of elections in Spain and uncertainty over how Greece s debt
problems could be contained 
 Losses  however  were limited by gains in heavyweight BP
  which rose 2 7 percent after scoring a major win in
sharing the cost of the Gulf of Mexico spill as partner Mitsui  
Co agreed to pay  1 1 billion towards the clean up bill 
 ID nLDE74J06S 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
shares closed 0 2 percent lower at 1 136 12 points  bringing
total losses for the week to 0 4 percent 
 Fitch pushed Greece s credit rating deeper into junk
territory and warned of further downgrades if a credible plan to
resolve the country s debt crisis was not found   ID nLDE74J1K7 
  Towards the end of the week people decided to take some
profits  There is still uncertainty regarding restructuring in
Greece   said Markus Huber  senior trader at ETX Capital 
  There s nothing out there to push things higher  and there
is a lack of buyers  Investors have the feeling that in a few
days time they can buy at lower levels  
 Banks fell on concern over exposure to Greek debt  with the
STOXX Europe 600 banking index  down 0 8 percent 
 Peripheral stocks slipped  with the Thomson Reuters
Peripheral Eurozone Index  down 2 1 percent 
  The  Fitch  downgrade is a further confirmation of the lack
of confidence in Greece s ability to meet targets previously
agreed as part of a bailout  It seems inevitable that some kind
of debt restructuring will now have to take place   a
London based equity trader said 
 Investors will also be monitoring the local elections in
Spain on Sunday  with the ruling Socialist party expected to
suffer heavy losses over its handling of the economic crisis  a
prominent pollster said   ID nLDE74J09D 
 
 SHORT TERM HEADWINDS
 Analysts said the market could be going into a period of
short term weakness on slowing earnings momentum  currency
headwinds and expectations of an end to the U S  Federal
Reserve s quantitative easing programme  though longer term
fundamentals such as cheap valuations and healthy balance sheets
should help limit downside pressure 
  Earnings in Europe have provided a very nice tailwind to
the market     but that tailwind has begun to fade now  We also
have a currency headwind and the business cycle indicators have
started to turn down  another reason to be a bit more cautious
in the shorter term   said Robert Parkes  strategist at HSBC  
  But at the same time we feel that the downside risk is
limited because of the valuation support  the health of
companies and balance sheets and M A  
 Equity valuations on Thomson Reuters Datastream showed the
STOXX Europe 600  carrying a one year forward
price to earnings of about 10 8 against a 10 year average of

 Among the fallers on the index were clothing retailers
Hennes   Mauritz  and Inditex   which fell 1 5

177744,399260,GPS,Belmond  Gap  ExxonMobil  Statoil And EniSpA Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   May 25  2016    highlights Belmond Ltd     as the Bull of the Day and Gap Inc  NYSE GPS      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  Corp     Statoil  OL STL  ASA    and  EniSpA    

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

Belmond Ltd     is cashing in on the demand for  experiences   This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to see double digit earnings growth in 2016 

Belmond is a luxury travel and hotel company  It operates 46 hotels worldwide including in destination cities like Venice  St  Petersburg and Santa Barbara  It also operates 7 luxury tourist trains  including the Venice Simplon Orient Express  three river cruises  safaris and the  21  Club restaurant in New York City 

Big Beat in the First Quarter

The first quarter of the year is historically a seasonally slow one for Belmond but it beat the Zacks Consensus by 9 cents  Earnings were a loss of 3 cents compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents 

It has surprised 3 out of the last 4 quarters 

First quarter constant currency RevPAR growth exceeded the company s own guidance  rising 9  year over year on a constant currency basis  The quarter was boosted by a 5  increase in average daily rate   ADR   and a 3 percentage point increase in occupancy 

Europe was a highlight in the quarter with revenue rising 13  year over year  In particular  it saw revenue growth of  1 million  or 31   at Belmond Reid s Palace in Madeira Portugal due to increased demand for that destination 

It s river cruises  however  saw declining revenue in the quarter as one of its two cruise ships in Myanmar  the Belmond Road to Mandalay  saw a 32  revenue decline due to increasing competition in the country  Up until this year  Belmond mostly had river cruising in Myanmar to itself 

Analysts Are Bullish

The company said it was encouraged by the strong start to the year in what is historically its slow period 

The analysts are encouraged too as estimates have risen since the earnings report 

2 estimates have moved higher in the last 30 days pushing up the 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate to 22 cents from 16 cents 

That is earnings growth of 22 2  

Earnings are expected to move higher in 2017  albeit not quite as strongly  But analysts see another 4 5  earnings growth in 2017 



  



Gap Inc     continues to struggle as it can t find it s way in the ever changing apparel landscape  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has again had its estimates cut for this year and next 

Gap is a global specialty retailer with more than 3300 company operated stores and 400 franchised stores in 90 countries along with e commerce sites  It operates the well known brands Gap  Banana Republic  Old Navy  Athleta and Intermix brands 

Another Bad Quarter

Gap has been struggling since 2015 as it found itself off trend with its flagship brand Banana Republic and came up against steep competition on the low end where its Old Navy brand had thrived 

Comparable store sales were down across its three largest brands  and the only ones which it breaks out sales comps for 

Gap global comparables fell 3   Old Navy declined 6  while Banana Republic slid 11  

This was the quarter where we were supposed to see improvement in Banana s numbers as it was rolling out  what it believed  would be a popular spring line  But the shoppers haven t yet returned 

Many former Banana customers  myself included  are leery  We will pay for quality  If I want to shop at the cheaper level like H M  I ll shop there  Give me something that won t fall apart in 2 months

Oil Discoveries Lowest Since 1952  Is This Bottom 

Per a report by research firm IHS  the year 2015 marks the least amount of oil and gas discovered in over the last 64 years 

New oil discovered outside North America in 2015 totaled 2 8 billion barrels  the lowest amount since the industry actively started its worldwide oil exploration after World War II  The year also represented the fourth straight year of declining oil volumes   something that had never happened before 
	Notably  about 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent  BOE  was added through gas discoveries in the year  This signifies the fifth consecutive year wherein gas volumes discovered surpassed oil volumes discovered Factors Behind the Decline in Volumes
	Per Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   major oil players have been forced to make substantial budget cuts to combat the freefall in oil prices  This is particularly true with respect to exploration  where spending was reduced to a meager  95 billion in 2015 from  168 billion two years earlier  ExxonMobil Corp      is among the long list of companies that have slashed their capital budget 
	Moreover  the industry wide pullback of drillships from international waters as companies began to shift focus to shale formations in Texas  North Dakota and Oklahoma resulted in decline in discoveries  Given that investments in shales are both cheaper and less risky than drilling in international waters  the move was an expected one in the lackluster commodity price scenario 

However  analysts are of the opinion that the unconventional oil in North America is not sufficient to resolve the lack of discoveries  Tight oil production is estimated to account for about 15  of global output by 2040 
	At the start of the decade  when oil demand rose rapidly  explorers were seen splurging astronomically on exploration  However  the outcome was poor with only a few notable hydrocarbon discoveries  such as Statoil ASA s    Johan Sverdrup field off Norway s coast or EniSpA s    giant Zohr gas field off Egypt 
	In 2015  companies drilled about 4 300 conventional exploration and appraisal wells compared with 5 200 in 2014 and 5 300 in 2012  Deep water drilling  which means drilling in 1 000 to 5 000 feet of water  decreased by more than 20  and the ultra deepwater well count plunged more than 40  from 2014 
	However  a surge in new oil fields in recent years and the increase of Iran s production on the back of international sanctions raises optimism about exploration in the short term 
	Over the longer run we feel to avoid any supply gap in the future  we believe that exploration companies should continue to focus on exploring instead of waiting for the commodity price to improve  In case the companies do not take immediate action  the challenges may be difficult to overcome  After all oil discoveries are essential to substitute resources  meet an ever growing demand and offset the depletion of existing fields

and has whittled down her annual holiday party to 20 people 
  It s minimal and only when I can find stuff on sale   she
said of her gift buying this year 
 The National Retail Federation predicted on Friday that
two thirds of Americans still had holiday shopping left to do 
while 44 5 million consumers still had not even begun 
  With so much shopping left to do  the weekend before
Christmas will be one of the most important periods of the year
for retailers   said NRF President and CEO Tracy Mullin 
 Stores like Macy s Inc  and J C  Penney Co Inc 
were primed to greet shoppers starting at 6 a m  after staying
open until midnight on Friday 
  It s our last one day sale before Christmas  announced
Macy s in a full page ad that ran in many U S  newspapers 
accompanied by a  10 coupon  The department store chain even
kept its doors open 24 hours at some East Coast locations

 A MAD SCRAMBLE
  Super Saturday     the Saturday before Christmas that
represents the final major day of holiday shopping    usually
ranks just behind  Black Friday  as the single largest holiday
sales day  Black Friday fell on Nov  28 this year  the day
after U S  Thanksgiving 
 This year  Saturday could be busier than expected  if storm
conditions ease up  More severe weather was forecast for
Sunday

because it s basically the only day we have   said Scott
Bernhardt  chief operating officer for weather tracking firm
Planalytics   Once you shovel out  go to the mall because
another one is coming on Sunday  
 Still  fewer shoppers in stores on Friday and Sunday could
be a serious blow to store chains  who may be forced to further
mark down merchandise  Online stores like Amazon com Inc
 may benefit as consumers can shop from home and still
have gifts delivered by Christmas 
 The weekend before Christmas typically accounts for some
11 5 percent of holiday sales  according to ShopperTrak  which
monitors shoppers at more than 50 000 retail locations 
 Last year  Super Saturday totaled  8 7 billion in retail
sales of everything from apparel to sporting goods and books 
up 1 percent from the same day in 2006 
 While most U S  stores have seen months of dismal sales
results  many are willing to sacrifice their profit margins by
offering steep discounts just to make sure they will not be
left with excess inventory come January

upmarket label Massimo Dutti  has moved into fast growing
economies like Russia and China  with more than 4 200 stores in

Mauritz  H M  is likely to feel some effects from the global
financial crisis but is doing better than some of its

   Ups annual profit forecast for third time
   Shares close down 0 2 percent ahead of announcement
By Taiga Uranaka
 TOKYO  July 9  Reuters    Japan s Fast Retailing posted 28
percent growth in nine month operating profit on Thursday 
buoyed by robust sales at its Uniqlo casual clothing chain  and
lifted its full year forecast for the third time 
The company represents one of the few bright spots among
major domestic retailers  with Uniqlo attracting price conscious
shoppers amid Japan s worst recession since World War Two 
 Earlier this month  Japan s top retailers Seven   I Holdings
and Aeon Co Ltd posted steep falls in quarterly profit  hurt by
a sharp sales decline in clothes and household items despite
aggressive markdowns 
 Fast Retailing  which runs about 770 Uniqlo stores at home
and 70 overseas said its operating profit came to 97 2 billion
yen   1 04 billion  for the nine months ended in May 
 Same store sales at Uniqlo stores in Japan posted a hefty
15 4 percent growth during the three months ended in May  thanks
to the popularity of its T shirts and other summer items 
 In addition to brisk sales at Uniqlo  the company has
overhauled its cut rate g u  chain  marking prices down even
further and tempting consumers with offerings such as 990 yen
  10 4  jeans  about a quarter of the price of those at Uniqlo 
 The chain  viewed as Uniqlo s answer to Gap Inc s Old Navy
brand  has seen its sales soar since then 
 For the full year through August  the company now expects
operating profit to grow 23 4 percent from a year earlier to 108
billion yen  up from 101 billion yen in the previous forecast
and in line with an average forecast of 108 8 billion yen in a
poll of 20 analysts by Thomson Reuters 
 Fast Retailing shares gained 20 percent in the 12 months to
Wednesday  against an 18 percent decline in the Tokyo stock
exchange s retail subindex 
 On Thursday  its shares closed down 0 2 percent prior to the
announcement

177782,399298,GPS,Seniority Worth Nothing  Unhappiness Spreads With Minimum Wage Hike,opinion,"Unhappiness is spreading with minimum wage hikes 
Those on the job for a few years complain to deaf ears that they deserve more than new hires who don t know the ropes 
Some think this is an unforeseen consequence  I see at as a planned consequence 
The Wall Street Journal reports  

The growing push to raise the minimum wage to as much as  15 an hour is creating new issues in the workplace  While some of America s lowest paid workers will get fatter paychecks  their veteran colleagues may feel underpaid 
At Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  and Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   which recently increased wages  store managers have had to address employee questions about fairness and pay  Some companies have raised pay for veteran workers  and others plan to offer extra fringe benefits  fearing that valuable workers might otherwise jump ship 
In Seattle  where city laws require many large employers to phase in a  15 minimum wage by 2017  Mud Bay store employees now earn at least  12 an hour  with 50 cent hourly pay hikes planned for September and January 2017 
 I d love to be able to pay you a dollar more but there are costs   Ms  Knowles told store employees  adding   we re still in business to make money  
Some economists say minimum wage increases could boost productivity  curb worker turnover and prompt stronger spending from low income families  Detractors warn wage hikes could come with higher prices for consumers and weigh employers down with hefty costs 

Rising Tide

Rising Wages and Productivity
Apparently a rising tide does not lift all boats  at least not yet 
Whoever dreamt up the notion that rising wages increase productivity is an economic fool 
Generally speaking it s the opposite 
Rising productivity supports higher wages  However  there are global pressures and robotic pressures that influence that decision 
If anything  higher wages appear to have made more people unhappy than the happy new hires 
Meanwhile the debate is on  Was this a planned occurrence by those pushing for higher minimum wages  or was it an unforeseen consequence 
Debate is Moot
I vote for the former  but it really does not matter 
Either way  store expansion will slow  Businesses that are profitable at  7 25 may not be at all profitable at  15 
It is idiotic to dispute that simple truth  but many do so ",2016-05-08,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/seniority-and-skills-not-worth-anything;-unhappiness-spreads-with-minimu-200128583,200128583
177783,399299,GPS,Here s Why Gap  GPS  Stock Is Tanking Today,opinion,"On Tuesday  shares of struggling retailer Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS   are tumbling  down over 12  in midday trading after the company received price target cuts at multiple firms 
Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  reduced its price target for Gap to  17 from  21  and maintained its  Sell  rating on the stock  Analysts at RBC Capital also lowered the company s price objective from  26 to  20 with a  Sector Perform  rating  suggesting a potential downside of 8 30  from GPS  previous close 
Nomura also cut its price target for Gap to  19 from  26  and maintained its  Neutral  rating   Gap businesses are simply too large in the new normal where physical distribution has become a liability and uniformity is no longer  cool    Nomura analysts noted 
Jeffries slashed its price target on GPS to  28 from  34 while reconfirming a  Buy  rating  and MKM Partners lowered its price target to  21 from  25

177785,399301,GPS,Fooled By History  Gap Stock As A Case Study,opinion,"Gap Inc  NYSE GPS 
With the recent sell off of Gap stock on underwhelming guidance issued by management for first quarter results  it sits on the market at just around  19 a share  That currently represents a price to earnings ratio of around 9  price to free cash flow of around 10  and a dividend yield of around 4 8   Relative to its sector  an ownership slice of Gap today gives you much more earnings  cash flow  and dividends 
Now  when you combine this with a look at the historical per share performance of Gap  it may start tempting you to take a serious look at becoming an owner of this retailer 
Shares outstanding have shrunk from 836 million in 2007 to 413 million by 2016  This has meant earnings per share has grown from  0 93 per share to  2 23 per share  Dividends per share have also increased from  0 32 to  0 92  with a payout ratio of only 40   This represented a dividend payout growth rate of 11  per year  Earnings per share grew at 9  per year over the previous decade 
Although Gap seems to have performed well enough over the past decade  there are three major issues to look out for 
First  revenue and net income have barely grown consistently over the past 10 years  The per share growth numbers might blind you to the fact that actual revenue and net profit growth were erratic through the past decade  It is telling that the company faces real issues with growth when the total revenue and net profit finish off the decade where it started a decade ago  These are the numbers that drive the value of the business  If revenue and profit growth are stalled  or worse in decline  the current price to earnings ratio of around 9 is not really all that cheap 
Second  Gap faces intense competition on multiple fronts  The apparel industry is unforgiving  both in terms of competitors and fashion trends  Fickle consumer tastes can leave yesterday s winner a loser in the blink of an eye  With mass consumer fashion trends led by quick changes in styles throughout the season  apparent by H M s sales strategy  and increased online commerce  Gap has been flat footed in keeping up with consumer trends and behaviour 
Third  weak revenue and profit growth on the back of increasing competition has forced Gap into a turnaround situation  Warren Buffett is famous for stating that turnarounds rarely turn  By that  it s meant that it s best to avoid turnaround situations as only a small percentage of turnarounds actually succeed  Gap could be one of the exceptions  However  you would need to have some pretty big faith in the abilities of Gap s management 
When looking at a situation such as Gap  while per share numbers can look attractive looking in the rearview window  one should think a little deeper  Companies can only borrow so much to buy back shares to prop up per share growth figures   real revenue and profit growth is ultimately needed to drive the value of the business up  The erratic revenue and profit numbers over the past decade demonstrate that this is a company that is struggling to grow any further  It is unlikely to turnaround the situation into the growth it experience in the distant past  Gap is more likely a value trap than a cheap value opportunity

Without any outside influences  the global economy and the global financial system will continue to rapidly fall apart 
But if we do have a major  black swan event  take place  that could cause the bottom to fall out at any moment ",2016-02-17,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/21-new-numbers-that-show-that-the-global-economy-is-absolutely-imploding-200118496,200118496
177801,399317,GPS,In Some States  A Very Deep Economic Downturn Has Already Begun,opinion,"Did you know that there are some U S  states that have already officially fallen into recession  Economic activity all over the planet is in the process of slowing down  and there are some areas of the country that are really starting to feel the pain  In particular  any state that is heavily dependent on the energy industry is hurting right now  During the years immediately following the last recession  the energy industry was the primary engine for the growth of good paying jobs in America  but now that process is completely reversing  All over the U S  energy companies are going under  and thousands upon thousands of good jobs are being lost 
On Sunday evening  Bloomberg published an article entitled     The following is an excerpt from that article 

As economists size up the chances of the first nationwide slump since 2009  pockets of the country are already contracting  Four states   Alaska  North Dakota  West Virginia and Wyoming   are in a recession  and three others are at risk of prolonged declines  according to indexes of state economic performance tracked by Moody s Analytics 

The three additional states that are  at risk of prolonged declines  are Louisiana  New Mexico and Oklahoma  What all of those seven states have in common is a strong dependence on the energy industry  Last year  67 oil and gas companies in the United States filed for bankruptcy  and approximately 130 000 good paying energy jobs were lost 
If the price of oil does not go back up  this could be just the beginning  It is being reported that a whopping 35 percent of all oil and gas companies around the planet are at risk of falling into bankruptcy  and the financial institutions that have been backing these energy companies are getting very nervous 
Of course things could shift dramatically for oil and gas companies if World War 3 suddenly erupts in the Middle East  and that could literally happen at any time  But for the moment the outlook for the energy industry continues to be quite dreary 
Let us also keep in mind that the problems for the U S  economy are not limited to the energy industry  According to   corporate profits in the United States have now declined for three straight quarters  and this is the very first time this has happened since the last recession 

With 87 percent of the S P 500 reporting  total blended fourth quarter earnings have shown a decline of 3 6 percent  according to FactSet  Assuming the trend holds up  it will mark the first time profits have fallen for three straight quarters since 2009 
But the road ahead doesn t get any easier 
FactSet is now projecting that earnings will decline 6 9 percent in the first quarter  a stunning move lower over time considering that in September the expectation was for 4 8 percent growth 

As corporate profits fall  layoffs are starting to increase  Just the other day we learned that the number of job cuts in this country shot up 218 percent during the month of January according to Challenger  Gray   Christmas 
It is starting to look very much like 2008 all over again  and I am convinced that it will soon be much  much harder to find work in America 
Here are some more numbers that indicate that the U S  is heading into a major economic slowdown 
 U S  exports were down 7 percent on a year over year basis in December 
 U S  manufacturing activity has been in contraction for four months in a row 
 U S  factory orders have fallen for 14 months in a row 
 The Restaurant Performance Index in the United States has dropped to the lowest level that we have seen since 2008 
 Orders for Class 8 trucks in the United States dropped by 48 percent on a year over year basis in January 
But the mainstream media continues to try to convince all of us that everything is going to be just fine  Earlier today  CNN ran an article entitled  U S  recession fears fade after market rally   and the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled    that got a tremendous amount of attention 
Well  if the U S  economy is in such great shape  then why are some of the biggest retailers in the entire nation shutting down stores at a frightening pace  The following list of store closures comes from one of my previous articles 
 Wal Mart  N WMT  is closing 269 stores  including 154 inside the United States 
 K Mart is closing down more than two dozen stores over the next several months 
 J C  Penney  N JCP  will be permanently shutting down 47 more stores after closing a total of 40 stores in 2015 
 Macy s  N M  has decided that it needs to shutter 36 stores and lay off approximately 2 500 employees 
 The Gap  N GPS  is in the process of closing 175 stores in North America 
 Aeropostale  N ARO  is in the process of closing 84 stores all across America 
 Finish Line  O FINL  has announced that 150 stores will be shutting down over the next few years 
 Sears  O SHLD  has shut down about 600 stores over the past year or so  but sales at the stores that remain open continue to fall precipitously 
Perhaps things look fine for the moment in New York City or Washington D C  or San Francisco or wherever it is that these  reporters  write their articles 
But for ordinary Americans that operate in the real world  the pain of this new economic downturn is already exceedingly apparent  Here is more  

Dale Oxley doesn t need to hear about rising odds of a U S  recession to dread the future  For the West Virginia homebuilder  the downturn has already arrived 
 Everyone is going to have to tighten their belts   said Oxley  the 48 year old owner of a Charleston area construction company   The next couple of years are going to be difficult  

Unfortunately for hard working Americans like Oxley  what we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg 
We have entered a long downturn that is ultimately going to be even more painful than the last recession was 
And everything changes if Saudi Arabia and Turkey get trigger happy and decide to invade Syria  If that happens  it could very well be the spark that sets off World War 3 and a full blown meltdown of the global financial system ",2016-02-23,Michael T.

Lululemon has had a rough couple of years  starting in March 2013 with its  pantsgate  saga during which the company had to recall around 17  of its black yoga pants because they were too sheer  that segued into a public relations nightmare that ensued when founder Chip Wilson made disparaging remarks about women s bodies  During this time the company was also going through a dry spell for selection and variety  but recent improvements to product mix and customer service seem to be paying off 
In January  the company forecast an increase in same store sales that was roughly double analysts  expectations  It appears the company has figured out its supply chain issues  and reinvigorated customers with a greater variety of merchandise  Add to this the fact that the company operates a  scarcity  model  making only limited quantities of product in order to spur demand and minimize inventory  This has resulted in a huge secondhand market for used merchandise  with fans often paying more than the original price for discontinued and out of stock items 

However  the stock has seen downgrades  most recently and detrimentally by Goldman Sachs who says the company is still at risk from growing competition from the likes of Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA  and Gap s  NYSE GPS  Athleta  among others  The stock dropped as a result  but is still up 9  for the year  While competition is no doubt heating up in this space  Lululemon has a loyal crowd of followers  unmatched by any of its peers at this juncture  It s up to new CEO  Laurent Potdevin  to ensure the needs of this dedicated base are continually met ",2015-03-26,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/as-the-athletic-apparel-scene-heats-up,-can-lululemon-retain-its-loyal-246290",246290

Gap noted that sales were bolstered because Easter was earlier than last year  but this will likely negatively impact April sales  The sales report did not include updates on Athleta  INTERMIX  and Piperlime  Gap s other brands 
Most investors turned bearish on the stock following the sales update 
On April 10  analyst of Sterne Agee reiterated a Hold rating on the retailer  He noted that although Gap posted an increase in comparable sales for March  the figures were  somewhat disappointing given the benefit of the Easter shift   Although Old Navy s performance was  very strong   Boruchow believes it was  mostly offset by sharp declines  at Gap and Banana Republic  He concluded   With the reversal of the Easter shift likely to weigh on April and fundamentals at the Gap brand remaining challenged  we remain fairly cautious on this stock  Ike Boruchow has a 78  overall success rate recommending stocks with a  16 4  average return per recommendation 
Separately on April 10  analyst  of Wells Fargo reiterated a Market Perform on Gap  Lejuez noted   While GPS did not quantify the impact of the Easter shift  we believe it likely benefited March comps by 500 700bps  with 400 500bps at Gap brand  800 1 000bps at  Old Navy   and by 100 200bps at Banana  Therefore  we expect the negative impact on April comps to be 800bps   He added that Average Unit Retail and Units per Transaction were all up  but traffic was flat Paul Lejuez has a 66  overall success rate recommending stocks with a  18 2  average return per rating

177940,399456,GPS,Equities At Risk  Gold Rallies  As Economic Growth Slows,opinion,Equities were dealt a crushing blow on Friday with the major indices all giving up between two and three full percentage points    All of the bearish wedge patterns featured in last weeks article were definitively broken and the bears were controlling the action with impunity    Friday s action was especially bloody because  there were multiple catalysts behind the action  European debt crisis expansion with rates on  safe  German bonds falling below zero   Chinese manufacturing slowdown indicates poor global economic growth   US Employment disappoints with less than half the expected jobs added in May   Stepping back and looking at the market from a long term perspective  the situation looks ominous  US equities have spent a bit more than three years repairing the damage from the 2007 2008 financial crisis  and now looks to be tracing out a broad topping pattern  From this perspective  there is plenty of room for additional weakness  with the  good  scenario allowing for support to hold between 1100 and 1000   and the  bad  scenario featuring a full fledged breakdown back to the  09 lows    The macro picture is bad enough  impossible European debt crisis  stalling Chinese growth  and more US pain  to justify forecasts for a cathartic breakdown  and there are a number of well respected macro traders calling for just such a situation    But from a shorter term perspective  Friday s action was bearish enough to leave the daily charts oversold  It didn t take long for sentiment to turn broadly bearish  and now a short term rally may be the path of maximum frustration that catches bearish traders off guard and invites  bottom pickers  to take a stab at new long positions    With short term patterns in this oversold condition  we are unlikely to initiate new positions early in the week  New bearish positions would be vulnerable to a dead cat bounce  and there simply aren t too many traditional long positions that we could embrace at this point    However  we still have a strong stable of profitable shorts to manage  as we balance the benefit of tightening risk points to protect our gains  and still giving these positions elbow room to evolve into much more profitable trend  trades    Below are some of the industries  groups and themes we are closely monitoring this week  Retail Weakness Accelerates    Last week we talked about the slowdown in luxury spending across the globe  Specifically  Tiffany   Co   TIF  announced disappointing sales from Europe to China to the US    This week  the luxury retail sector continued to take it on the chin as institutional investors reduced exposure to speculative issues  breaking chart patterns on their way out the door    We took half profits on our short Coach Inc   COH  position as the stock broke sharply below the key 5 17 support level    Based on the choppy action we have seen over the past two years  we re happy to book quick profits when they are available  and covering half of the position while tightening our risk point to breakeven on the second half still allows us to play for a much larger move    A consolidation or short term rebound in the group would allow us to build some  in the retail area   possibly taking shots at relatively new and evolving breakdowns like Lululemon Athletica  LULU   Gap Inc   GPS   or Zumiez Inc   ZUMZ     As the economic picture darkens  the negative feedback loop will be especially tough on the retail sector  Consumers have begun to run out of credit options and the employment picture is souring  A slowdown in the sector will lead to layoffs  more employment challenges  and less incentive to spend  The bearish retail theme could end up being in play for quite some time  Homebuilders  Back to Shortable Levels    For the last year  we ve been a bit skeptical of the broad rally in homebuilder stocks  Deferring to the bullish price action  we haven t taken any bearish bets  But considering the fundamental risk for the industry  we haven t felt comfortable putting our capital on the line from a bullish perspective    This week  a number of key home construction stocks broke their bullish trendlines  Thanks to the strong sentiment this group has enjoyed for the last 18 months  homebuilders are now breaking down from premium price multiples   giving them plenty of room to drop before valuations become enticingly cheap    Headline statistics have been misleading with declines in the number of bank foreclosures giving investors false hope  According to housing expert Keith Jurow  banks are avoiding foreclosures in an attempt to avoid pressuring the market even further       Of course with any rebound in housing activity  banks will restart the foreclosure process and attempt to recoup the capital they have lost in mortgage transactions    Now that the price action has turned bearish for this industry   and the broad market is providing a tailwind   we re watching for opportunities to short rallies or consolidation patterns and participate in continuation declines as investors lose faith in this faltering group  While the majority of sectors were getting pummeled by the bearish action on Friday  one particular area exhibited uncharacteristic strength    The precious metals universe basically turned on a dime and rallied sharply   breaking through resistance areas and attracting significant amounts of capital    Friday s action was a game changer for precious metals as investors transitioned from lukewarm growth expectations to an icy environment where slowing growth leads to more action from central bankers   and ultimately currency debasement    Ironically  the weak economic picture provides multiple catalysts to propel gold miners higher  Poor growth expectations have led to a massive drop in oil prices  which in turn lowers production costs for the miners  The same could be said for labor costs which should also ease in a negative growth period    At the same time  liquidity injections and the fear of currency weakness directly affect gold prices  allowing miners to sell their production at inflated prices    Now that the initial surge has taken place  we re watching for pullbacks and researching individual miners to determine where the best opportunities are  Over the next few months  we could build a stable of longer term gold miner positions with potential for massive profits as sentiment levels shift dramatically   As Asian markets
