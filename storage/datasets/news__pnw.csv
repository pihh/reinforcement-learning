117666,339181,PNW,Mandalay to build 3 000 Arizona homes with solar and Sonnen batteries,news,"By Nichola Groom  Reuters    German battery maker Sonnen GmbH on Thursday said it would partner with home builder Mandalay Homes to outfit 3 000 new Arizona homes with batteries to store the excess energy generated by their rooftop solar installations  Mandalay plans to build the homes in Prescott  Arizona with the batteries  which can cost between  10 000 and  20 000  The cost would be part of the home s sale price and wrapped into the mortgage  The companies want utilities to pay the homeowners to use the stored power in the 3 000 batteries  which would create a virtual power plant with 8 megawatt hours of electricity  enough to power about 5 000 average homes for a day  Even if utilities do not buy the power  homeowners would save money by not having to buy as much or any power from the grid  said Sonnen Senior Vice President Blake Richetta   For now however  the project is moving forward without buy in from utilities  Sonnen s U S  arm and Mandalay have been in talks with Pinnacle West Capital  NYSE PNW  Corp s Arizona Public Service and Salt River Project for a few months  they said  The community would be the first of its kind in the United States  the companies said  and comes as utilities have been studying the potential benefits of integrating battery storage along distribution grids and decreasing reliance on centralized fossil fuel plants  Sonnen has several such communities in Germany  but the idea is still a novelty in the United States  Batteries are viewed as especially key in large solar energy markets like Arizona that generate more power than they need during the sunniest times of the day   Sonnen has about 1 000 home batteries deployed in the United States currently  and aims to get to at least 20 000 by 2020  in part through more deals with homebuilders  Arizona Public Service would not comment on talks with Sonnen and Mandalay  but said batteries  can provide benefit to both our customers and the grid

117668,339183,PNW,When Does Market Timing Actually Work    October 15  2019,opinion,"There is no better feeling for an investor than trusting your gut or doing your research and timing the markets correctly  right 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Utilities stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation  NYSE PNW   Atlantic Power Corporation  AT   American Water Works Company  Inc   AWK   Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP  BIP   Algonquin Power   Utilities Corp   AQN 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Fruitful market timing requires three key parts  1  A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks  or securities  gold or different kinds of investments   2  The capacity to act on the sign accurately  3  The control to follow up on it 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  both Pinnacle West and Southern Co  are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
PNW currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 04  while SO has a forward P E of 19 71  We also note that PNW has a PEG ratio of 3 67  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  SO currently has a PEG ratio of 4 38 
Another notable valuation metric for PNW is its P B ratio of 1 75  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SO has a P B of 2 07 
Based on these metrics and many more  PNW holds a Value grade of B  while SO has a Value grade of C 
Both PNW and SO are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that PNW is the superior value option right now ",2020-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pnw-vs-so-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200497663,200497663

117710,339225,PNW,When Does Market Timing Actually Work    August 13  2019,opinion,"There is no better feeling for an investor than trusting your gut or doing your research and timing the markets correctly  right 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Utilities stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation  NYSE PNW   Algonquin Power   Utilities Corp   AQN   Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP  BIP   American Water Works Company  Inc   AWK   Atlantic Power Corporation  AT 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Fruitful market timing requires three key parts  1  A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks  or securities  gold or different kinds of investments   2  The capacity to act on the sign accurately  3  The control to follow up on it 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He warns not to sell during small crashes  and weather the storm by focusing on the long term 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

117748,339263,PNW,Low Beta Stocks To Buy As Market Volatility Increases,opinion,"May has seen some of the most volatile equity markets since January  The VIX  also known as the market s  fear index   hit its highest levels since the first week of 2019 this month 
Investors have a renewed concern over the US China trade dispute as both parties add to the already hefty tariff schedule  With both sides playing hardball  investors are worried that this prolonged dispute will continue to give US companies grief  Global economic slowdowns are also a concern weighing on the markets and causing investors to contemplate whether the US is next 
In this article I will discuss some low to negative beta options to hedge anyone s portfolio in these volatile times 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange   NASDAQ CME  
The CME Group is the largest commodity   derivatives exchange in the world  Based out of downtown Chicago  it offers firms a wide variety of derivatives and futures to hedge their business  The exchange is also used by speculative traders who believe they can beat the market 
As the markets have become increasingly volatile over the past month and the CME has shown investors an almost 10  gain while the S P 500 is down roughly 5  since the beginning of May 
 
CME has a beta very close to zero making it a safer bet in rough market waters 
Most of the volume that is traded on the CME are interest rate derivatives  which are used to help businesses hedge floating interest rates  expected future borrowing as well as expected future lending  They also offer futures and options in equities  foreign exchange  agriculture  and commodities 
When the market breaks down companies tend to hedge more of their business due to the perceived future risk associated with a market downturn  Speculative traders on the CME exchange are also trading larger volumes because of the increased volatility  something every day trader is waiting for 
The CME Group s revenue is driven almost entirely by volume and as the markets break volumes increase for the reasons mentioned above 
Volume has consistently increased over the past 5 years by an average annual rate of 9   CME Globex has primarily driven this growth  This is CME s online platform that makes it easier for any business to hedge  no matter the size  The past 5 years have been relatively low volatility  so when the markets hit the fan expect CME to reap the benefits
CME is currently trading just off its 10 year forward P E high  I would wait to put a long position on CME until the valuation comes down a bit  Look to buy once CME drops below the  180 level  This low beta exchange is expanding and will make not only a good hedge but also an excellent long term investment at the right price 
AngloGold Ashanti Limited   NYSE AU  
Gold prices have an inverse relationship with the equity market because of its flight to quality characteristics  As you might guess  gold miners and gold move together 
AU has a beta of  1  implying that it will show investors returns when the broader equity market isn t  You can see this inverse relationship play out in this past month  as AU attains 8  returns and the S P 500 slides almost 5  
 
AU is trading at favorable multiples  with its forward P E of 11 2x below its 10 year median and far below the gold mining industry average  north of 30x   If you factor expected growth into its P E multiple the investment looks even more attractive  trading at a PEG of 0 6x  significantly below the industry average of 5x 
AngloGold Ashanti is expected to grow its EPS by 90  this year and 21  in 2020  Analysts have raised these estimates considerably over the past 2 months thrusting AU to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Pinnacle West Capital   NYSE PNW  
Investors often use utility companies as investment safe havens because of their consistent cash flows and large dividend payouts  Falling interest rates  which we have been seeing  are also good for utility companies because of the capital intensive nature of their business causing them to carry a lot of debt on their balance sheet  Historically during market downturns  utility stocks have outperformed the broader equity market 
Pinnacle West Capital is a utility holding company whose subsidiaries provide Arizona with electricity  PNW is responsible for generating and distributing electricity to 1 2 million customers around the Phoenix area 
PNW is focusing on expanding its customer base and updating its infrastructure with renewable energy being a focal point  They are planning on investing roughly  4 billion over the next 3 years in order to make this happen 
Over the past decade  PNW has consistently grown its top and bottom lines as well as expand its margins  something most utility companies can t boast  PNW has performed exceptionally well over past 52 week  returning investors over 20   and outperforming both the industry average and the S P 500 
Analysts are have raised long term EPS outlook for PNW over the last 60 days propelling this stock into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
An expanding utility company that still pays out a dividend north of 3  is hard to come by  PNW is about 5  off its all time high  which it hit last week  and I believe now is the perfect time to add this low beta utility company to your portfolio 
Take Away
Market volatility is inevitable and the best way to protect your portfolio from exacerbated losses is to hedge it with low to negative beta options  You could use a growing exchange like CME for long term portfolio returns combined with a low beta hedge  at the right price   AU and other gold mining stocks with a negative correlation to the market will allow your portfolio to have some profitability even in the worst downturns  A utility company like PNW will give your portfolio sustainable yields and even some long term growth without adding to your market exposure

of 2018 Of that number  Tinder average subscribers were 4 7 million  up 1 3 million year over year The company is looking for market opportunities  especially in Asia Match was spun off from IAC in 2015  IAC still owns a large interest in Match As of Mar 31  2019  IAC had an economic ownership interest in Match which was 80 4  and a voting interest of 97 5  Analysts Bullish on 2019 and 2020Given the big beat and stellar subscriber growth  the analysts have been bullish with their estimates 7 estimates were revised higher  but one was lowered  in the last 30 days for 2019  That pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate up to  1 91 from  1 62 That s earnings growth of 25 7  compared to 2018 when the company made just  1 52 They are bullish on 2020 as well 5 estimates were revised higher  but 2 lower  over the last month for 2020  That pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate up to  2 23 from  2 09  which is another 17 2  earnings growth  Toll Brothers  Inc  is feeling the strain as home buyers are balking at high housing prices  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has increased incentives which is going to hit gross margins this year Toll Brothers builds luxury homes for move up  empty nester  active adult and second home buyers  It also builds urban and suburban rental properties The company operates in 22 states including Arizona  California  Colorado  Connecticut  Delaware  Florida  Georgia  Idaho  Illinois  Maryland  Massachusetts  Michigan  Nevada  New Jersey  New York  North Carolina  Oregon  Pennsylvania  Texas  Utah  Virginia and Washington  as well as in the District of Columbia Expanding Into Hot MarketsIn May 2019  Toll announced it was entering the metro Atlanta market by acquiring Sharp Residential  Sharp was one of Atlanta s largest private home builders Atlanta was also the largest US housing market that Toll did not have a presence Sharp focused primarily on the area s northern suburbs with homes ranging from first time to luxury at price points from the  300 000s to the  900 000s  At the date of acquisition  the Company had approximately  65 million in backlog consisting of 125 homes with an average price of  520 000 Toll also acquired approximately 900 lots owned and controlled in the Atlanta MSA in the deal Terms of the deal were not disclosed In the fiscal second quarter  Toll also expanded organically into two other hot markets  Salt Lake City and Portland  Oregon  with the opening of their first communities Toll said buyer interest had been  healthy  Toll Beats Again in the Fiscal Second QuarterOn May 21  Toll Brothers reported its fiscal second quarter results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by 10 cents  Earnings were  0 87 versus the consensus of  0 77 It was the 6th consecutive earnings beat Revenue was up 7  to  1 71 billion as deliveries rose 1  to 1 911 But the problem was that net signed contract value fell 16  to  2 billion and contract units were down 9  to 2 424 Also backlog value at the end of the quarter fell 11  to  5 66 billion The company struggled in California  a large luxury home market The level of incentives to get buyers to sign the contract jumped 13 3  from the first quarter and was 55  higher than the second quarter of last year  In 2018  it was giving average incentives of  22 000 but this year it had jumped to  34 000 This increase hits gross margins directly Analysts Cut Estimates for F2019 and F2020The high end of the housing market is feeling the pinch  even with mortgage rates dropping again Analysts are bearish about earnings due to the higher incentives and hit to gross margins  They ve been cutting since the earnings announcement 6 analysts cut their full year 2019 estimates in the last month  pushing the Zacks Consensus down to  3 91 from  4 38 during that time Toll made  4 71 in fiscal 2018 so that s an earnings decline of about 17  6 analysts also cut fiscal 2020 estimates pushing the consensus down to  4 29 from  4 51  But that s at least 9 5  earnings growth compared to 2019 Is the Rally Over The home builder stocks got crushed in 2018 as Wall Street feared rising rates would mean slowing sales Toll Brothers stock bottomed out in October 2018 and then staged a furious rally But the earnings report put a damper on the party  While Toll is still up 7 7  year to date  it s well off its recent highs Could it retest those October lows again this year Shares look cheap with a forward P E of just 9  Toll also pays a dividend yielding 1 2  But with incentives rising on weaker demand  it might be too early to jump back in Low Beta Stocks to Buy as Market Volatility IncreasesMay has seen some of the most volatile equity markets since January  The VIX  also known as the market s  fear index   hit its highest levels since the first week of 2019 this month Investors have a renewed concern over the US China trade dispute as both parties add to the already hefty tariff schedule  With both sides playing hardball  investors are worried that this prolonged dispute will continue to give US companies grief  Global economic slowdowns are also a concern weighing on the markets and causing investors to contemplate whether the US is next In this article I will discuss some low to negative beta options to hedge anyone s portfolio in these volatile times Chicago Mercantile ExchangeThe CME Group is the largest commodity   derivatives exchange in the world  Based out of downtown Chicago  it offers firms a wide variety of derivatives and futures to hedge their business  The exchange is also used by speculative traders who believe they can beat the market As the markets have become increasingly volatile over the past month and the CME has shown investors an almost 10  gain while the S P 500 is down roughly 5  since the beginning of May CME has a beta very close to zero making it a safer bet in rough market waters Most of the volume that is traded on the CME are interest rate derivatives  which are used to help businesses hedge floating interest rates  expected future borrowing as well as expected future lending  They also offer futures and options in equities  foreign exchange  agriculture  and commodities When the market breaks down companies tend to hedge more of their business due to the perceived future risk associated with a market downturn  Speculative traders on the CME exchange are also trading larger volumes because of the increased volatility  something every day trader is waiting for The CME Group s revenue is driven almost entirely by volume and as the markets break volumes increase for the reasons mentioned above Volume has consistently increased over the past 5 years by an average annual rate of 9   CME Globex has primarily driven this growth  This is CME s online platform that makes it easier for any business to hedge  no matter the size  The past 5 years have been relatively low volatility  so when the markets hit the fan expect CME to reap the benefitsCME is currently trading just off its 10 year forward P E high  I would wait to put a long position on CME until the valuation comes down a bit  Look to buy once CME drops below the  180 level  This low beta exchange is expanding and will make not only a good hedge but also an excellent long term investment at the right price AngloGold Ashanti LimitedGold prices have an inverse relationship with the equity market because of its flight to quality characteristics  As you might guess  gold miners and gold move together AU has a beta of  1  implying that it will show investors returns when the broader equity market isn t  You can see this inverse relationship play out in this past month  as AU attains 8  returns and the S P 500 slides almost 5  AU is trading at favorable multiples  with its forward P E of 11 2x below its 10 year median and far below the gold mining industry average  north of 30x   If you factor expected growth into its P E multiple the investment looks even more attractive  trading at a PEG of 0 6x  significantly below the industry average of 5x AngloGold Ashanti is expected to grow its EPS by 90  this year and 21  in 2020  Analysts have raised these estimates considerably over the past 2 months thrusting AU to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Pinnacle West CapitalInvestors often use utility companies as investment safe havens because of their consistent cash flows and large dividend payouts  Falling interest rates  which we have been seeing  are also good for utility companies because of the capital intensive nature of their business causing them to carry a lot of debt on their balance sheet  Historically during market downturns  utility stocks have outperformed the broader equity market Pinnacle West Capital is a utility holding company whose subsidiaries provide Arizona with electricity  PNW is responsible for generating and distributing electricity to 1 2 million customers around the Phoenix area PNW is focusing on expanding its customer base and updating its infrastructure with renewable energy being a focal point  They are planning on investing roughly  4 billion over the next 3 years in order to make this happen Over the past decade  PNW has consistently grown its top and bottom lines as well as expand its margins  something most utility companies can t boast  PNW has performed exceptionally well over past 52 week  returning investors over 20   and outperforming both the industry average and the S P 500 Analysts are have raised long term EPS outlook for PNW over the last 60 days propelling this stock into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  An expanding utility company that still pays out a dividend north of 3  is hard to come by  PNW is about 5  off its all time high  which it hit last week  and I believe now is the perfect time to add this low beta utility company to your portfolio Take AwayMarket volatility is inevitable and the best way to protect your portfolio from exacerbated losses is to hedge it with low to negative beta options  You could use a growing exchange like CME for long term portfolio returns combined with a low beta hedge  at the right price   AU and other gold mining stocks with a negative correlation to the market will allow your portfolio to have some profitability even in the worst downturns  A utility company like PNW will give your portfolio sustainable yields and even some long term growth without adding to your market exposure The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed

117790,339305,PNW,Pinnacle West  PNW  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Pinnacle West  PNW   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Pinnacle West is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Pinnacle West  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Pinnacle West
This power company is expected to earn  4 85 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 6 8  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Pinnacle West  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

117825,339340,PNW,Why Pinnacle West  PNW  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Pinnacle West  PNW   This company  which is in the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this power company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 18 56   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Pinnacle West was expected to post earnings of  0 17 per share  but it reported  0 23 per share instead  representing a surprise of 35 29   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 75 per share  while it actually produced  2 80 per share  a surprise of 1 82  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Pinnacle West  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Pinnacle West currently has an Earnings ESP of  65 52   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 1  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pinnacle-west-pnw-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200407869,200407869

117869,339384,PNW,Pinnacle West  PNW  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Pinnacle West  PNW   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Pinnacle West currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if PNW is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this power company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For PNW  shares are up 0 41  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 01  compares favorably with the industry s 2 93  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Pinnacle West have risen 6 45   and are up 23 32  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 6 11  and 1 87   respectively 
Investors should also take note of PNW s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  PNW is averaging 978 294 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with PNW 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PNW s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 81 to  4 85 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that PNW is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Pinnacle West on your short list ",2019-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pinnacle-west-pnw-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200396930,200396930
117870,339385,PNW,6 Stocks To Gain With Fed Set To Keep Rates Unchanged ,opinion,U S  stocks surged above a four month high on Feb 18 ahead of the Fed s two day meeting scheduled to begin later today  The central bank is widely expected to keep rate hikes on hold  which is a major factor bolstering investor sentiment  But market watchers also expect more details on its plans to end balance sheet reductions The Fed is also likely to unveil its latest  dot plot  which outlines its interest rate expectations for the year as well as the long run  Investors would love to witness only one rate hike taking place this year and the next In fact  Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   believes the Fed will let inflation run higher  allowing it to refrain from near term rate hikes  Rate sensitive stocks are likely to gain from such a dovish monetary stance  This is why it makes sense to invest in real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utility stocks Dot Plot  Balance Sheet Cuts Timeline ExpectedThe central bank didn t release a dot plot at the end of its January meeting  Instead  it outlined a neutral approach to interest rate adjustments  Per Fed Chair Jerome Powell  the new   patient  approach was attributed to sluggish inflation and a dismal outlook for global growth So the last dot plot available is the one released in December 2018  At that point  the median forecast called for two rate hikes in 2019  Jan Hatzius  an economist at Goldman Sachs thinks the Fed s will pencil in only one rate hike for 2019  Most economists concur with this view and think the next hike will come in 2020 Balance Sheet Cuts to End SoonThe Fed is also expected to reveal  how and when  it will stop reducing the size of its balance sheet  At one point  Powell had said these cuts were on  auto pilot    But by the fourth quarter of 2018  investors had started to complain about this process  They alleged that it was resulting in unusually tight monetary conditions The consequent decline in equity markets led the Fed to claim that it was  open  to switching its stance on balance sheet runoffs  By last month  the majority of the central bank s policymakers veered around to the view that  it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan  to end this process Fed to Allow For Higher Inflation  Says GoldmanMeanwhile  economists at Goldman Sachs believe that the Federal Reserve will tolerate a level of inflation higher than its targeted rate of 2   At this point  the central bank is undergoing an overhaul of its current policy framework  It is seriously examining other approaches to inflation targeting Goldman is of the opinion that it will ultimately adopt an average inflation targeting approach  In this case  the Fed will aim for 2  inflation on average over an entire business cycle  This allows for higher prices during expansionary phases to balance sluggish prices levels during a recession According to Goldman  this approach would  decrease the likelihood of further near term policy tightening   In effect  it would further reduce the urgency to undertake rate hikes in the near future  resulting in an extended softer interest rate regime Our ChoicesThe Fed is widely expected to refrain from announcing a rate hike at the end of this week s meeting  Further  it is anticipated to reduce expectations for future rate hikes  An announcement on when and how it plans to end balance sheet reductions is also likely Rate sensitive investments like utilities and REITs are useful additions to your portfolio under such circumstances  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Plymouth Industrial REIT  Inc    NYSE PLYM   is a full service

117872,339387,PNW,Yield Curve Inversion Signals Recession  5 Utility Picks,opinion,U S  stocks suffered stiff losses on Mar 22 as recessionary fears made a comeback to the bourses  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill for the first time since 2007  An inversion of the yield curve  which traces returns on bonds with different maturity dates  is widely believed to indicate that a recession is more than likely within a year or two The Fed s two policy decisions announced on Mar 20 contributed toward the dampening of investor sentiment  Not surprisingly  utility stocks were the biggest gainers of last Friday s trading session  Their superior yields and steady revenues make them good choices in a tough economic environment  Investing in this class of stocks would make for a smart move right now What Triggers a Yield Curve Inversion On Mar 22  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note declined by 10 basis points to 2 434   its lowest level since January 2018  In contrast  the yield on the three month Treasury bill declined by a single basis point to 2 462   In effect  the spread between the two maturities turned negative for the first time in 12 years With returns on shorter duration securities exceeding those with longer maturity periods  the yield curve has inverted  This brings us to the yield curve itself  in this case  a graph of returns provided by government bonds of different durations but identical quality until the principal amount has been paid off  Usually  this graph slopes upward since long term rates exceed short term returns This means that when the yield curve inverts  short term rates are exceeding their long term counterparts  In other words  long term bonds are in high demand  a phenomenon which pushes down their yields   Read   This is because investors are adopting a negative view of short term economic prospects  According to the Federal Reserve of San Francisco  an inversion of the yield curve has heralded every U S  recession since 1955 with only one exception  Researchers believe that a negative three month 10 month spread is the most reliable of all recessionary indicators Fed

Tail Corp    NASDAQ OTTR    Pinnacle West Capital Corp    NYSE PNW    NextEra Energy  Inc    NYSE NEE    ONEOK Inc    NYSE OKE   and PNM Resources  Inc    NYSE PNM   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Yield Curve Inversion Signals Recession  5 Utility PicksU S  stocks suffered stiff losses on Mar 22 as recessionary fears made a comeback to the bourses  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill for the first time since 2007  An inversion of the yield curve  which traces returns on bonds with different maturity dates  is widely believed to indicate that a recession is more than likely within a year or two The Fed s two policy decisions announced on Mar 20 contributed toward the dampening of investor sentiment  Not surprisingly  utility stocks were the biggest gainers of last Friday s trading session  Their superior yields and steady revenues make them good choices in a tough economic environment  Investing in this class of stocks would make for a smart move right now What Triggers a Yield Curve Inversion On Mar 22  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note declined by 10 basis points to 2 434   its lowest level since January 2018  In contrast  the yield on the three month Treasury bill declined by a single basis point to 2 462   In effect  the spread between the two maturities turned negative for the first time in 12 years With returns on shorter duration securities exceeding those with longer maturity periods  the yield curve has inverted  This brings us to the yield curve itself  in this case  a graph of returns provided by government bonds of different durations but identical quality until the principal amount has been paid off  Usually  this graph slopes upward since long term rates exceed short term returns This means that when the yield curve inverts  short term rates are exceeding their long term counterparts  In other words  long term bonds are in high demand  a phenomenon which pushes down their yields   Read   This is because investors are adopting a negative view of short term economic prospects  According to the Federal Reserve of San Francisco  an inversion of the yield curve has heralded every U S  recession since 1955 with only one exception  Researchers believe that a negative three month 10 month spread is the most reliable of all recessionary indicators Fed

117944,339459,PNW,Bet On These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Escape Debt Traps,opinion,Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance its capital projects  Now a comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well  So  debt financing remains more dearer for corporates In fact  statistics indicate that America  the richest economy in the world  is the biggest borrower too  Notably  huge spending on wars  big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation s burden over the years  According to the latest estimates given by the Congressional Budget Office  federal debt is projected to increase to nearly 100  of the economy s GDP by 2028 Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect the company s bottom line Nevertheless  this should not discourage investors from spending on U S  stocks since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country is a leader  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  thus avoiding those that carry high debt loads Empirically  several leverage ratios have been constructed to measure the exact amount of debt risk a company bears in order to safeguard investors from debt traps Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  which has been used to evaluate a company s credit worthiness  for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company With the Q4 earnings season in full swing currently  investors must be targeting companies with solid earnings growth projections  But  in the uncertain world of investment  markets can falter anytime  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectationZacks Rank  1 or 2  Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 24 stocks that made it through the screen Merit Medical Systems Inc

Fortunes of domestic focused regulated utilities do not change with the vagaries of the economy  Non availability of replacement of services provided by utilities is the biggest driving force  Mature utilities gain from the introduction of new technology to maintain their transmission and distribution lines  introduction of smart meters in their service territories  and regular measures to improve the resilience of services The new rates in service territories  customer growth  effective management  control of expenses will have a positive impact on the earnings of utilities  The players are focused on producing more electricity from renewable sources and battery storage projects during adverse situations  The EIA projects utility scale battery storage capacity to increase by 34 GW during 2020 2050 due to continued decline in battery storage costs Furthermore  the unemployment rate in the United States during the end of fourth quarter was at an impressive 3 9   This low level of

117969,339484,PNW,5 Stocks To Gain From Fed s Dovish Stance In 2019 ,opinion,All eyes are on the Federal Reserve  with a two day meeting of the policymakers scheduled to start on Jan 29  Earlier this month  Fed Chair Jerome Powell had struck a dovish tone on monetary policy  This will likely remain the overarching theme for the year  with the Fed widely expected to leave rates unchanged after its last meeting Further  a report from The Wall Street Journal claims that the central bank is nearing the end of its balance sheet reduction process   An end to offloading bonds would take the pedal off monetary tightening considerably  Rate sensitive stocks are likely to gain from such a move  This is why it makes sense to park your funds in real estate and utilities stocks  Fed Close to Ending Balance Sheet ReductionsAccording to a report from The Wall Street Journal released on Jan 25  Fed officials are nearing a decision on ceasing the process of trimming the size of its balance sheet  The process started in October 2017 at which point it had ballooned in excess of  4 5 trillion Market participants have long believed that offloading these bonds have tightened the monetary environment even further  The upcoming two day policy meeting is likely to see key Fed officials mulling over when to cease these bond roll offs  In fact  officials hinted in December that the benchmark funds rate could turn volatile if the central bank continued with such bond sales The attitude of markets to the balance sheet trimming program is well known  An extreme negative reaction ensued when Fed Chair Powell suggested in December that the operation was likely to continue Now  key Fed officials are suggesting otherwise  In an interview to the Journal on Jan 15  Kansas City Fed President Esther George said   A lot of heavy lifting has been done  Rate Hikes Unlikely Until JuneAnalysts and market watchers alike widely believe that the Fed is unlikely to hike rates at its upcoming meeting  Further  the central bank is likely to refrain from doing so in many more meetings over the next few months until the middle of summer is reached According to Andreas Johnson  U S  economist at Nordic bank SEB  the Fed will likely  hold its target range  for the federal funds rate at 2 25 2 50  till June  At that point  the key rate will be hiked to 2 75   Meanwhile  per the CME FedWatch Tool  the probability that the Fed will keep its rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting stands at 98 9   A Bloomberg survey released recently also indicated that 60 out of 62 respondents believed that a rate hike was unlikely at the Jan 29 meeting  One factor preventing the Fed from taking a firm call on rates is the lack of official data  This is an outcome of the recent government shutdown  which has delayed several key releases Our ChoicesMarket watchers and economists widely believe that a rate hike after the latest Fed meeting is unlikely  Further  rates will likely remain unchanged until June  Additionally  reports have emerged that the central bank is mulling over ending its balance sheet reduction process Rate sensitive investments like utilities and real estate stocks are useful additions to your portfolio under such circumstances  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep

117974,339489,PNW,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Pinnacle West  PNW ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Pinnacle West  PNW   This company  which is in the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This power company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 30  
For the most recent quarter  Pinnacle West was expected to post earnings of  2 75 per share  but it reported  2 80 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 82   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 44 per share  while it actually produced  1 48 per share  a surprise of 2 78  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Pinnacle West  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Pinnacle West has an Earnings ESP of  1 19  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 22  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-pinnacle-west-pnw-200381348,200381348

at the news conference following the meeting Some economists criticized what they believe to be an excessively dovish stance  designed to cater to equity markets  Others were of the opinion that a data dependent approach was more in keeping with current circumstances  What is clear at this point is that rate sensitive stocks are likely to gain from such a move  This is why it makes sense to invest in real estate and utilities stocks  Central Bank Turns Dovish  Promises Measured Approach to HikesFollowing this week s two day policy meeting  the Federal Reserve opted to leave the federal

its latest meeting  A separate three paragraph statement has been released to address the issue Per the statement  the Fed is  prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments   Clearly  the process is not on autopilot as Powell had earlier indicated The Fed went on to indicate that it could even expand its balance sheet if necessary  Such an expansion would take place  if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate  Powell Adopts Decidedly Soft StanceMeanwhile  the Fed Chair adopted a decidedly soft stance on rates  indicating that the central bank has revised its outlook on further increases  Powell now believes that the  case for raising rates has weakened somewhat  Fed policymakers are dwelling on a number of issues at the moment  Powell hinted that inflation would be the decisive factor for further rate hikes  Geopolitical concerns such as Brexit talks and China s economic slowdown are other worries the central bank is taking into consideration Our ChoicesThe Fed s new found dovishness clearly indicates that the central bank is showing greater sensitivity to current economic and financial conditions  Fresh statements from the Fed Chair indicate that near term rates hikes will be

118002,339517,PNW,PNW Vs  UTL  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Utility   Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with Pinnacle West  PNW  and Unitil  UTL   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Pinnacle West has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Unitil has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PNW likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than UTL has recently  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
PNW currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 47  while UTL has a forward P E of 21 19  We also note that PNW has a PEG ratio of 3 90  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  UTL currently has a PEG ratio of 5 73 
Another notable valuation metric for PNW is its P B ratio of 1 73  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  UTL has a P B of 2 07 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PNW s Value grade of B and UTL s Value grade of C 
PNW sticks out from UTL in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that PNW is the better option right now ",2019-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pnw-vs-utl-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200373713,200373713

118006,339521,PNW,Recession Risk Hits 7 Year High  5 Secure Picks ,opinion,Fresh surveys from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal indicate that chances of a near term recession are spiking  A confluence of factors  including the trade war with China  a tighter rate regime and December s equity market sell off have helped to elevate such concerns significantly  And the longest federal government shutdown in U S  history hasn t helped matters Economists think that the impasse could shave crucial points off this year s GDP  Expectations of a recession in 2020 are even higher  and at the very least we could be in for a significant slowdown this year  This is why it is important to make your portfolio as recession proof as it can get Apart from consumer staples and utilities  discount retailers  low cost airlines and healthcare providers are stocks  which could be relatively unaffected by recessionary conditions  Adding them to your portfolio make for a smart move at this point Odds of Recession Increase ExponentiallyThe latest monthly poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal estimates that there is a 25  chance of a recession occurring within the next 12 months  These are the highest odds since October 2011 and represent an exponential increase from 13  recorded last year The trade war with China  a spike in rates and December s market sell off are the primary reasons for heightened odds of a recession  In fact  the outlook for 2020 is even grimmer  There is a 56 6  chance of a recession next year  which features presidential elections  per economists A Bloomberg survey conducted over the past week revealed similar chances of a recession  Analysts who participated in the survey believe there is median 25  chance of a downturn in the next 12 months  higher than the 20  revealed by December s survey   Slowdown in 2019  Recession in 2020 The first recessionary fears  which surfaced last year  were sparked by prospects of a yield curve recession  Analysts at JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   believe that declining yields  taken together with recent equity market losses and mounting low grade debt levels  indicate that there is a 50  chance of a slowdown within a year Per Bloomberg s survey  the median estimate for this year s economic growth declined to 2 5  from the 2 9  recorded in 2018  This is likely because the impact of last year s tax cuts have begun to fade  Meanwhile  China s economy continues to struggle and central banks across the world  These factors have been cited by Societe Generale   OTC SCGLY   as reasons for a downturn in 2020 Ultimately  even if a recession doesn t occur this year  the odds of a near term slowdown have increased significantly  While jobs data remains strong  PMI numbers have declined to a 15 month low  Additionally  manufacturer s business confidence has plunged to a near two year low Our ChoicesSeveral surveys indicate that the chances of a near term recession have increased significantly  Trade tensions  tighter rates and fears of an economic slowdown have contributed to such speculation  The effect of last year s tax cuts  which provided substantial stimulus last year  have also started to fade This is why it is prudent to add stocks to your portfolio  including utilities and consumer staples  which can protect your profits from recessionary conditions  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score Centene Corporation   NYSE CNC   is a well diversified  multi national health care company that primarily provides a set of services to the government sponsored health care programs The recession proof nature of health care stocks is well documented  Further  it is important to note that the industry

WMT   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Recession Risk Hits 7 Year High  5 Secure PicksFresh surveys from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal indicate that chances of a near term recession are spiking  A confluence of factors  including the trade war with China  a tighter rate regime and December s equity market sell off have helped to elevate such concerns significantly  And the longest federal government shutdown in U S  history hasn t helped matters Economists think that the impasse could shave crucial points off this year s GDP  Expectations of a recession in 2020 are even higher  and at the very least we could be in for a significant slowdown this year  This is why it is important to make your portfolio as recession proof as it can get Apart from consumer staples and utilities  discount retailers  low cost airlines and healthcare providers are stocks  which could be relatively unaffected by recessionary conditions  Adding them to your portfolio make for a smart move at this point Odds of Recession Increase ExponentiallyThe latest monthly poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal estimates that there is a 25  chance of a recession occurring within the next 12 months  These are the highest odds since October 2011 and represent an exponential increase from 13  recorded last year The trade war with China  a spike in rates and December s market sell off are the primary reasons for heightened odds of a recession  In fact  the outlook for 2020 is even grimmer  There is a 56 6  chance of a recession next year  which features presidential elections  per economists A Bloomberg survey conducted over the past week revealed similar chances of a recession  Analysts who participated in the survey believe there is median 25  chance of a downturn in the next 12 months  higher than the 20  revealed by December s survey Slowdown in 2019  Recession in 2020 The first recessionary fears  which surfaced last year  were sparked by prospects of a yield curve recession  Analysts at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  believe that declining yields  taken together with recent equity market losses and mounting low grade debt levels  indicate that there is a 50  chance of a slowdown within a year Per Bloomberg s survey  the median estimate for this year s economic growth declined to 2 5  from the 2 9  recorded in 2018  This is likely because the impact of last year s tax cuts have begun to fade  Meanwhile  China s economy continues to struggle and central banks across the world  These factors have been cited by Societe Generale  PA SOGN  as reasons for a downturn in 2020 Ultimately  even if a recession doesn t occur this year  the odds of a near term slowdown have increased significantly  While jobs data remains strong  PMI numbers have declined to a 15 month low  Additionally  manufacturer s business confidence has plunged to a near two year low Our ChoicesSeveral surveys indicate that the chances of a near term recession have increased significantly  Trade tensions  tighter rates and fears of an economic slowdown have contributed to such speculation  The effect of last year s tax cuts  which provided substantial stimulus last year  have also started to fade This is why it is prudent to add stocks to your portfolio  including utilities and consumer staples  which can protect your profits from recessionary conditions  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to

118078,339593,PNW,Top Stocks Reports For United Parcel Service  TOTAL   Ford,opinion,"Thursday  May 17  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   TOTAL  TOT  and Ford  F   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
United Parcel Service s shares have underperformed the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry in the past year  gaining  13 1  vs  23   Despite this unimpressive price performance  the company s earnings per share and revenues surpassed expectations in first quarter 2018  Both metrics also improved year over year  
Results were aided by the strong performance of its international segment  Robust e commerce growth is a positive too  In February 2018  UPS had hiked quarterly dividends by 10   The Zacks analyst thinks that a further uptick in such shareholder friendly activities cannot be ruled out  in the light of the savings induced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  In fact  UPS  solid free cash flow in first quarter supports the possibility of a dividend hike in the near future   
However  high operating expenses continue limiting bottom line growth  Also  UPS  2018 capex forecast  which is higher than 2017 levels  is expected to weigh on the bottom line 
 You can   
Shares of TOTAL have gained  17  in the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Integrated International Oil industry which has increased  14 4  over the same period  TOTAL s earnings per share in the first quarter lagged expectations but surpassed the year ago quarter s earnings  due to strong operational performance  cost control and contribution from new projects  
The Zacks analyst thinks TOTAL is gaining from higher oil production and the improvement in commodity prices  Going forward  the company will benefit further from upstream startups and cost management initiatives  It continues to gain from the strategic acquisitions and non core asset divestures  The company is utilizing its strong cash flow generating capacity to strengthen its balance sheet  pay dividend and buy back shares  
However  operations in some politically troubled regions and increasing competition could impact the company s profitability  Due to its global presence  it is also exposed to risks associated with doing business abroad 
 You can   
Ford s shares have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry over the last three months   7 8  vs  6 4    In first quarter 2018  Ford s adjusted earnings and revenues surpassed expectations  Both earnings and revenues were higher on a year over year basis  
The company s fitness initiatives have identified an additional  11 5 billion of cost and efficiency opportunities  promising a better future  Also  Ford is focusing more on building up a winning portfolio and investing more on trucks  utilities and commercial vehicles  Also the acquisitions of Autonomic and TransLoc are critical for its mobility strategy  
However  frequent vehicle recalls to fix safety issues are adding to Ford s expenses and is also reducing consumers  confidence in the brand  Also  rising metal prices are hurting its profit 
 You can   
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include TD Ameritrade  AMTD   American Electric  AEP  and TELUS  TU  
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Pinnacle West and WEC Energy Group are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
PNW currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 89  while WEC has a forward P E of 21 47  We also note that PNW has a PEG ratio of 4 45  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 4 89

118214,339729,PNW,The Recent Strongest Stocks  Utilities  REITs And Homebuilders ,opinion,"Sellers once again lost their advantage as the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   came roaring right back from its ugliest close since the U S  Presidential election  The bullishness on the day was on full display with the number of  by 181 to 79 
While the S P 500  SPY  still has to prove itself with a fresh close above its 50 day moving average  DMA   I decided to examine some scans at  to identify some of the strongest stocks in the market   stocks I might want to buy on the next major market pullback  assuming another one actually occurs one day   What I found greatly surprised me 
I used SwingTradeBot to download its list of    the last day the S P 500 closed at an all time high   and stocks making new 52 week highs on Tuesday  April 17  2017   I used the Bot s standard filters including stocks with only the highest grade of  A   Between these dates  the S P 500 lost 1 9  and established a downtrend from its all time high  I figured that any stock which managed to hit new 52 week highs across these points must be a pretty strong and resilient stock 
I expected the list to be full of technology stocks with a good helping of speculative stocks  Instead  of the 16 stocks that made the grade  4 are utilities  4 are REITs  and 2 are home builders  The other half consists of an assortment of consumer related business and just ONE technology related company  That technology company  Interxion Holding NV  NYSE INXN   is a Netherlands based company that runs data centers 
Here is the complete and alphabetized list along with the associated industry

I am of course gratified to see home builders make the list as I have recently wavered on continuing to hold home builders as the seasonally strong period comes to an end  I have little interest in utilities given my impression of this industry holding a lot of very expensive stocks just as interest rates are rising  granted  the persistent strength in utilities may be telling us that interest rates are not going up nearly as fast or as high as we might think  
I have the most interest in INFO  I use Markit s economic reports on a periodic basis   INXN  data centers are a growth industry and I have been thinking about plays on a European economic recovery   ENR  who doesn t use batteries    and ILG  upside left to its all time high but I need to investigate a LOT more  in that order 
Since earnings season is upon us  I will be looking for confirmation of strength in the market s reaction to the earnings of these stocks  I will also bubble these stocks up to the top of any buy list on a market sell off 
Even if I never trade any of these stocks  not likely   I learned a valuable trick in using SwingTradeBot for quickly identifying a small and manageable list of buyable stocks  SwingTradeBot has a lot of other scans  and I encourage interested traders to check them out 
In the meantime  I have posted a daily chart of the S P 500 and a weekly chart of the individual stocks for full perspective 

The S P 500  SPY  almost reversed all its losses from the previous trading day  The converging 20 and 50 day moving averages  DMAs  loom directly above as potential resistance 


IHS Markit Ltd   INFO  has delivered some juicy dips for buying on its multi year run up 


Interxion Holding N V   INXN  is enjoying a strong multi year run up 


Energizer Holdings  Inc   ENR  had a rough return to trading going into early 2016  ENR is up a healthy 32 6  year to date 


ILG  Inc   ILG  made a new 52 week high  but the stock is trying to prove itself between a double bottom  2011 to 2016  and a downtrend from the all time high in late 2013

surprise of 8 34  Let s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement Factors at PlayPG E Corp is one of the leading utilities in the U S  in the integration of private rooftop solar arrays and boasts a solid portfolio of regulated utility assets that offer a stable earnings base and substantial long term growth potential Last year  despite facing severe storm  the company delivered the second best electric reliability performance in its history  thanks to its continued investments in a modern self healing grid that automatically isolates and minimizes customer outages  Moreover  the company continues to strengthen its gas system by inspecting and upgrading hundreds of miles of transmission pipeline and replacing over 100 miles of distribution main Such initiatives are expected to bolster PG E Corp  s top line growth in 2017 as well  while the company strives to boost margins by improving its cost structure  performance and reliability of nuclear and fossil fuel fired units Coming to the first quarter updates  at the very onset of this reporting cycle  the company announced that it will implement certain changes to streamline its existing operations  These new strategies include reducing the number of officers by 15  and other employee count by 390  In addition  the company eliminated the roles of nearly 800 non employee contractors and has decided not to fill 500 open  non critical positions  We may expect further updates on these initiatives once the company releases its first quarter results Furthermore  capacity related project delays reduced the company s cost for electric transmission in 2016  Similar results are expected to be witnessed in yet to be reported quarter s results as well In Dec 2016  the company received the final Phase 2 decision in relation to its Gas Transmission and Storage rate case  On account of this  the company expects to record an additional ex parte penalty of  15 million  in the first quarter In addition  the company s service territories witnessed warmer than normal temperatures during the first quarter  This will result in lower household expenditure on heating and  in turn  might adversely impact revenues for this energy provider For the first quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 84 cents  reflecting a 2 7  year over year improvement  Moreover

118283,339798,PNW,5 Conservative Utilities From The Wild West,opinion,In today s low interest rate environment  utility stocks offer investors a reasonable alternative to bonds  Utility stocks tend to be low growth  but stable equities that attract investors primarily looking for above average dividend income  However  like all low growth vehicles  it is especially important to focus on valuation when looking at utilities as an investment option  Of the five western utility stocks covered in this article  only Hawaiian Electric  HE  appears to be valued at the high end of its historical valuation  but not excessively  Sempra Energy  SRE  is an example of a high historical valuation  but compensates potential investors based on expectations by offering faster growth than the other four  The remaining three look attractive based on earnings expectations  Five Reasonably Valued Western Utility StocksThe following table summarizes five western utility companies that appear to be reasonably valued  and lists them in order of dividend yield highest to lowest  From left to right  the table shows the company s stock symbol and name  Next  two valuation metrics are listed side by side  the current PE ratio followed by the historical normal PE ratio for perspective  Then the five year estimated earnings per share growth is shown next to each company s historical EPS growth providing a perspective of the past versus the future growth potential of each company  Next the estimated annual total return  The final three columns show the current dividend yield  the company sector and its market cap A Closer Look at the Past and the Future Potential   Since a picture is worth 1 000 words  we ll take a closer look at the past performance and future potential of each of our five candidates through the lens of    Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated historical graphs clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  The historical normal PE ratio line  dark blue line with   depicts a PE ratio that the market has historically applied    The orange True Worth  line and the blue normal PE ratio line provide perspectives on valuation  The orange line reflects the fair value of each company s earnings relative to its growth rate achievement  and the blue line reflects how the market has traditionally valued the company s stock relative to its fair value  The blue line represents a trimmed historical normal PE ratio  the highest and lowest PEs are trimmed   These lines should be viewed as barometers or aids for ascertaining sound buy  sell or hold decisions  Rather than seen as absolutes  they should be seen as guides to better thinking   For more than 100 years  Hawaiian Electric Company has provided the energy that has fueled the islands  development from a Hawaiian kingdom to a modern state

ConclusionsUtility stocks have historically been known as conservative investments with above average dividend yields  Therefore  investors seeking income from equities within a reasonable level of risk may find opportunities within the utility sector  Each of the five companies highlighted in this article offer yields that are greater than can be had from a 30 year Treasury bond  However  the reader should note that the dividend records from utility stocks can be somewhat spotty and therefore  moderately unpredictable  Consequently investors seeking a growing dividend income stream may

118284,339799,PNW,Enhance Your Utility Sector Returns,opinion,"Imagine you re a pilot who is preparing to land an airplane  You ve just eased up on the throttle  thereby slowing your airspeed  To compensate  you gently pull back on the yoke to increase the plane s angle of attack  A buzzer suddenly goes off  it s the stall warning  Your approach is too slow  The aircraft is at risk of rapidly losing altitude and the consequences could be dire 
The concept of a stall speed can apply to economics  as well  That is  economic output tends to transition to a slow growth phase  stall  at the end of an expansion before the economy falls into a recession 
Right now  a buzzer should be sounding at the Federal Reserve because the U S  economy has officially slowed below stall speed 
Excluding the impact of inventories  real economic growth in the first half of 2015 was just 0 54   Lackluster wage growth also indicates continued labor market slack  In the second quarter  the Employment Cost Index  a broad measure of labor costs  posted the smallest gain since records began in 1982 
Indeed  recent data further support my view that the risk of a meaningful rise in interest rates is low  And because we re in a subdued economic growth and inflation environment  I believe that the utilities   electricity  gas  and water companies   continue to be viable investments 
However  we must be wary of valuations  especially for relatively high yielding securities  Investors starved for yield have bid up prices across the utility sector  pushing average valuations to historically high levels  We also want to avoid utilities that are excessively levered 
Luckily  we can help alleviate both of these concerns with the trusty enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio 
Remember  the EV EBITDA ratio compares the total stakeholder value net of cash with the total cash flows available to all stakeholders  Firms with high equity valuations and or high debt levels have higher  less attractive  EV EBITDA ratios 
To illustrate the power of this valuation metric  I ran a backtest starting in June 1995  Here  my universe of stocks is US listed utilities with market caps above  1 billion  The stocks are ranked based on EV EBITDA  and the top two deciles  cheapest 20   are included in the Cheap Utilities Composite  The bottom two deciles  most expensive 20   are included in the Expensive Utilities Composite 
The screen is rerun each month and the composites change as the companies  valuations change  The constituents are allocated to on an equal weight basis and the cumulative total return  dividends reinvested  for each composite is tallied 
The results of this backtest are shown below 

As you can see  the Expensive Utilities Composite produces a cumulative return of 363  over 20 years  Meanwhile  the Cheap Utilities Composite gained an incredible 680   which actually trounces the 451  total return posted by the mighty S P 500 over this same time frame 
Clearly  there s an edge to buying cheap utilities based on the EV EBITDA ratio  Furthermore  the cheap utilities also experienced smaller declines  The largest drawdown  peak to trough decline  that you would ve experienced in the Expensive Utilities Composite was 40   compared with just 35  for the Cheap Utilities Composite 
Higher returns with lower volatility   the best of both worlds 
Currently  the median EV EBITDA for all U S  listed utilities with market caps greater than  1 billion is 9 9  which is relatively high  The current constituents of the Cheap Utilities Composite  which includes companies such as AES  NYSE AES   Ameren  NYSE AEE   AGL Resources  NYSE GAS   and Pinnacle West  NYSE PNW   have a median EV EBITDA of 7 8 
In the midst of persistently low interest rates and with an economy below stall speed  utilities are attractive investments that can help protect your portfolio from broader stock market declines  Just make sure your utilities are cheap with a low degree of leverage ",2015-08-05,Alan Gula,https://www.investing.com/analysis/enhance-your-utility-sector-returns-260645,260645
