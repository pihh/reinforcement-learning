contribute significantly to Brinker s business going forward Meanwhile  the company s partnership with mobile and online food ordering service  Olo  for its To Go platform  continues to provide digital services to restaurants and offers Chili s customers with pre order  group order and pay flexibility  This integration is helping the company garner more members for the loyalty program  and thereby retain customers Brinker also stands to gain from integrating its My Chili s Reward program with Plenti   a rewards program by American Express  NYSE AXP  that offers leading brands across multiple categories  It gives Chili s access to Plenti s huge database of members and is likely to improve sales and profits Moreover  the company launched a digital curbside platform in its company

2018By all measures  2017 was a stellar year for U S  stocks  with the Dow hitting several record highs and the S P 500 closing at an eye popping level of 2 700   But  will the smooth sail continue this year  Wall Street s bulls believe that sweeping tax cuts by the Republican led Congress will add up to bigger profits and larger stock gains this year  The market is also expected to continue its winning streak banking on a rise in wages and more confident consumers  Needless to say  the economy is on track to see the fastest expansion in decades  And it has successfully unloaded some of the baggage that had slowed it down since the Great Recession in 2009 As many of the supportive conditions that boosted the market in 2017 are likely to stay in 2018  investing in multibaggers seems judicious  These stocks will make most of the bull run  courtesy of strong fundamentals and businesses that can multiply in a short span of time  After all  these stocks have seen their prices increase multiple times their initial investment values Markets Pin Hopes on Another Banner YearIn 2017  the Dow gained 25 1  after hitting 71 record closing highs  the highest since the blue chip

post sizeable returns this year as well  While some expect the Dow to hit 30 000  Tony Dwyer  the chief market strategist at New York financial firm Canaccord Genuity  raised 2018 year end target for the S P 500 to 3 100  up from an earlier projection of 2 800  This will mark a return of almost 16  higher than its current level of around 2 680 So  what s driving such bullish sentiments Landmark Tax BillPresident Trump s tax cut had lifted optimism about corporate earnings  prompting many analysts to raise their forecast for business profits  The House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U S  tax code in 30 years  Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle class Americans  The headline grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35  to 21  and will be implemented next year  instead of being delayed until 2019 Republicans also repealed the 20  corporate alternative minimum tax  while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8  to 15 5   instead of the current 35   Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U S  companies around  32 5 billion in 2018  as per Congress s joint committee on taxation  read more    Americans Upbeat About

analysis by the National Employment Law Project  This will result in inching employees wage closer to  15 an hour  which is known as  living wage   Jobless rate is already at its lowest since 2000 and

2038,223553,BBQ,After big selloffs  a second take on restaurant shares,news,By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK  Reuters    Restaurant stocks have sat like dry toast for the last six months  but investors are now starting to nibble back into the sector   After aggressively buying restaurant shares early in 2015  investors started dumping them midyear on fears that the industry was spread too thin  The public appetite for eating out was not expanding as fast as the industry itself and an anticipated bump in sales based on gasoline savings was not as big as expected  Now  after more than a dozen restaurant companies   including El Pollo Loco  O LOCO    Cosi   O COSI   Famous Dave s of America  O DAVE  and trend leader Shake Shack  N SHAK    have lost more than half their value  some investors are coming back around   We are getting close to an investment opportunity in restaurant stocks   said Bryant Evans  portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign  Illinois  He just bought into Darden Restaurants  N DRI   which owns the Olive Garden chain and is down almost 14 percent from last July  and pays a 3 4 percent dividend   THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT  BUT     There are signs of a pick up in the restaurant industry  with December sales up 7 5 percent from the same period a year earlier  according to Census Bureau data  Sector employment has been expanding as well  in January it was up 3 5 percent from January 2015  according to preliminary Labor Department data  But investors need to choose wisely  Higher employment spells greater labor costs for an industry on the front lines of the battle for a higher minimum wage  Consumers have been tight with their gasoline savings  And the industry may have gotten ahead of itself   Overall sales in the industry are fine but it is being spread out over so many more restaurants that it is very challenging and competitive to drive same store sales and traffic   said Andy Barish  a San Francisco based analyst with Jefferies  Fewer than three in 10 restaurant operators expect to have higher comparable sales in six months  according to a survey from the National Restaurant Association  the lowest level in more than six years  SELECTIVE ORDERING A MUST Few expect the next move in restaurant stocks to resemble early last year  when Shake Shack went public  doubling in price in its first four months  Investors aggressively bid up shares then  inspired by data showing that consumers were starting to spend more in restaurants than on groceries  A sign that the excitement was reaching a peak may have come in October  when The Restaurant exchange traded fund  came to market  Reality bit  Shares fell  in some cases sharply  At least one company   sandwich chain Jimmy John s   pulled its IPO late last year  The Restaurant ETF peaked on its opening day and has fallen 12 percent since  Now  shares are far lower than they were  but still not exactly cheap  The 41 restaurants in an industry index  on average sport share prices 26 times earnings over the past year  making them more expensive than the S P 500  which is trading at roughly 17 times  according to Thomson Reuters data  The index as a whole has fallen 6 5 percent from a Feb  1 high  compared with a 3 7 percent decline in the S P over that period  Some  such as McDonald s Corp  N MCD   trading near its all time high on the popularity of its all day breakfast menu  have outperformed  Others have faced trouble  Wendy s  O WEN  shares fell the most in a year on Tuesday  even as it reported quarterly sales that beat expectations  Investors seeking value in that space are looking at dividends  Cracker Barrel  O CBRL    Bob Evans Farms   O BOBE   DineEquity  N DIN   Darden and McDonald s all yield more than 3 percent   To reward investors long term  however  restaurants will have to win market share from their competitors without discounting away their profitability   That s the challenge for the industry over the next couple years  to absorb some of this growth   said Barish   We re seeing a very competitive pricing environment right now  ,2016-02-11,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/after-big-selloffs,-a-second-take-on-restaurant-shares-384315",384315
2052,223567,BBQ,5 Top Multibagger Stocks To Buy In 2018,opinion,By all measures  2017 was a stellar year for U S  stocks  with the Dow hitting several record highs and the S P 500 closing at an eye popping level of 2 700   But  will the smooth sail continue this year  Wall Street s bulls believe that sweeping tax cuts by the Republican led Congress will add up to bigger profits and larger stock gains this year  The market is also expected to continue its winning streak banking on a rise in wages and more confident consumers  Needless to say  the economy is on track to see the fastest expansion in decades  And it has successfully unloaded some of the baggage that had slowed it down since the Great Recession in 2009 As many of the supportive conditions that boosted the market in 2017 are likely to stay in 2018  investing in multibaggers seems judicious  These stocks will make most of the bull run  courtesy of strong fundamentals and businesses that can multiply in a short span of time  After all  these stocks have seen their prices increase multiple times their initial investment values Markets Pin Hopes on Another Banner YearIn 2017  the Dow gained 25 1  after hitting 71 record closing highs  the highest since the blue chip index s creation in 1896  The S P 500 added 19 4   while the Nasdaq outperformed both with a 29  gain  The tech heavy index moved north for the sixth straight year   its longest streak since the one that lasted from 1975 to 1980  per WSJ Market Data Group  In fact  all the three major bourses recorded the best year since 2013 The most optimistic stock strategist further says that U S  stocks will post sizeable returns this year as well  While some expect the Dow to hit 30 000  Tony Dwyer  the chief market strategist at New York financial firm Canaccord Genuity  raised 2018 year end target for the S P 500 to 3 100  up from an earlier projection of 2 800  This will mark a return of almost 16  higher than its current level of around 2 680 So  what s driving such bullish sentiments Landmark Tax BillPresident Trump s tax cut had lifted optimism about corporate earnings  prompting many analysts to raise their forecast for business profits  The House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U S  tax code in 30 years  Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle class Americans  The headline grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35  to 21  and will be implemented next year  instead of being delayed until 2019 Republicans also repealed the 20  corporate alternative minimum tax  while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8  to 15 5   instead of the current 35   Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U S  companies around  32 5 billion in 2018  as per Congress s joint committee on taxation  read more    Americans Upbeat About EconomyConsumers  in the meanwhile  have stepped into the new year with confidence  The minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States  according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project  This will result in inching employees wage closer to  15 an hour  which is known as  living wage   Jobless

2119,223634,BBQ,Mondelez  MDLZ  Q2 Earnings Top  Stock Falls On Sales Miss,opinion,"Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ   beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  but missed the same on revenues in the second quarter of 2016 due to currency headwinds and other global pressures  Shares declined 1 13  in pre market trading 
Earnings Beat
Second quarter adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents by 10 0  
Adjusted earnings were flat year over year  On a constant currency basis  earnings grew 4 5  driven primarily by adjusted operating income improvement  largely offset by the Jul 2015 divesture of the company s coffee business 
Mondelez is aggressively reducing costs under its  3 5 billion restructuring plan  which was announced in 2014  Under the plan  the company is accelerating supply chain cost savings and reducing overhead costs through layoffs  asset disposals and implementation of a zero based budgeting system  ZBB   The savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and capacity expansion to accelerate top line growth and gain market share MONDELEZ INTL Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Sales Beat
Net revenue decreased 17 7  year over year to  6 302 billion due to negative currency impact as 80  of Mondelez s sales are generated outside the U S  Further  the Jul 2015 divesture of the company s coffee business and the historical Venezuelan operations hurt sales 
Last July  Mondelez formed a joint venture  JV  to combine its coffee business with that of D E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts  the largest global pure play coffee company  As a result  the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies  received a 43 5  interest in the JV 
Revenues  however  lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 332 billion by 0 5  
Organic revenues inched up 1 5   less than 2 1  recorded in the last quarter as improved organic growth in Latin America  Asia Pacific and North America was offset by lower revenues from EMEA regions and Europe 
Pricing increased 1 6  to recover commodity and currency related input cost inflation  However  the pricing gains were less than 2 8  in the previous quarter 
Volume mix declined 0 1  due to elasticity impact from higher pricing  challenging category trends and increased competitive pressures  The volume decline was  however  narrower than a 0 7  drop in the previous quarter 
Margins Up
Adjusted gross margin remained flat year over year but increased 40 basis points  bps  sequentially to 40 1  as supply chain productivity gains offset the negative impact of mark to market adjustments related to commodity and currency hedging 
Adjusted operating income increased 17 4  year over year on a constant currency basis to  960 million  Adjusted operating margin increased 210 bps year over year and 10 bps sequentially to 15 2  on the back of continued reductions in overhead costs  driven by the ongoing benefits from zero based budgeting 
2016 Outlook
The company has updated its guidance for 2016 
Organic net revenue is expected to increase approximately 2  in 2016  Foreign currency is likely to hurt net revenue by roughly 4   higher than 3  previously 
Adjusted operating margin is still expected in the range of 15  16  in 2016 on the back of lower supply chain and overhead costs 
Management expects adjusted earnings to increase at a double digit rate on a constant currency basis  The company now expects to deliver incremental EPS of 3 cents to 5 cents for 2016  driven by solid operating results year to date  lower than expected interest expense and strong results from the coffee joint venture investments  which will effectively offset the impact of a challenging currency environment 
Currency headwinds are now expected to hurt adjusted earnings by about 8 cents  much more than 5 cents expected previously 
Free cash flow is anticipated to be at least  1 4 billion 
Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

2120,223635,BBQ,BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  Q2 Earnings Lag On Weaker Comps,opinion,"BJ s Restaurants Inc   NASDAQ BJRI   posted weak second quarter 2016 results wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Despite menu innovation and efficiencies derived from Project Q  the company s comps declined and were softer than anticipated due to a difficult operating environment 
Adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but increased 19 5  from the year ago figure of 47 cents  The year over year upside reflects improved revenues  continued restaurant growth and ongoing cost savings initiatives  which drove operating income margins 
Revenues of  250 3 million were up 7 9  year over year owing to new restaurant growth  Meanwhile  it lagged the consensus mark of  253 million by 1 1  BJ S RESTAURANT Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Inside the Headline Numbers
Comps in the quarter declined 0 2  as against prior quarter comps growth of 3 2  and the year ago quarter comps growth of 0 5   due to a challenging sales environment for the casual dining sector 
The company outlined various factors which led to the sluggish comps growth  including calendar shifts  weather  and other outside factors  Some of the sales softness is also the result of reallocating TV media spend in Southern California a year ago 
Restaurant level margin was 20 6   down 30 basis points  bps  year over year  Operating margin however improved 20 bps to 7 8  as general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined 40 bps and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales declined 50 bps  Besides boosting the top line  the company s Project Q initiative is helping it to curtail costs as well  It resulted in a reduction in average kitchen hours leading to labor efficiencies  However  these costs declines were partially offset by a 40 bps increase in cost of sales 
Going Forward
BJ s Restaurants believes that the strength of its model and operating leverage positions it well for continued financial growth in 2016 
Meanwhile  the company has planned menu innovations and marketing initiatives in the second half of 2016  These menu innovations include the recent additions to the  Loaded Burgers  lineup  a Monday through Thursday daily  Brewhouse Special  and several new items for the very successful  Enlightened Menu  category   The new  Enlighted Menu  items will focus on today s more popular  superfoods  and will be rolled out this fall 
However  the company expects sales headwinds in the near term due to social and political issues  weakening consumer confidence and increasingly global uncertainty

Rensi feels that if the minimum wage is increased to  15 per hour across the U S   companies hiring for entry level positions will opt to use robots instead of human staff  Rensi  who has held the post of CEO from 1991 to 1997 spoke against a wage hike at a time when employees were staging protests outside the McDonald s headquarters
