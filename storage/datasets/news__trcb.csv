2817,224332,TRCB,Should Value Investors Pick Two River Bancorp  TRCB  Stock ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Two River Bancorp   NASDAQ TRCB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Two River Bancorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 9  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 44  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Two River Bancorp  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 81 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 95  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Two River Bancorp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 93  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Two River Bancorp has a P S ratio of about 2 44  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Two River Bancorp currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Two River Bancorp a solid choice for value investors For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 83  which is better than the industry average of 11 01  Clearly  TRCB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Two River Bancorp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and Momentum Score of C  This gives TRCB a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen one upward revision compared to none downward in the past sixty days  whereas the next year estimate has also seen one upward revision compared to none downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate increased 1 5  in the past two months  whereas the next year estimate decreased 1 39   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Two River Bancorp Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and favorable estimate trends has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term 
Bottom LineTwo River Bancorp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the Zacks Rank  2 also indicates robust growth potential in the near future So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-two-river-bancorp-trcb-stock-200426526,200426526
2824,224339,TRCB,5 Stocks To Buy As Rate Hike Prospects Rise	,opinion,On Friday  comments from key Fed officials heightened prospects of a rate hike in the near term  The traditionally dovish Eric Rosengreen signaled that refraining from hiking rates any longer could harm the economy  Meanwhile  Daniel Tarullo sought further indications of rising inflation but added that he was open to a rate hike this year Meanwhile  Fed Governor Lael Brainard is due to speak on policy issues at an event on Monday  Historically known for her dovish approach  it is expected that she may adopt a different stance so as to raise market expectations about a hike  These events indicate that a near term rate hike is in the offing and it may be a good idea to pick stocks likely to benefit in such an event Officials Strike Hawkish ToneBoston Fed President Eric Rosengreen said that the Fed was running the risk of harming the economy if it held off raising rates for too long  Instead  steadily raising rates may be a more appropriate approach  Rosengreen admitted that external economic weaknesses remain a concern  However  he felt the U S  economy had shown enough resilience in the face of such worries Rosengreen felt the central bank runs the chance of overheating the economy if it holds off raising rates any longer  Speaking to CNBC  Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said he was looking for further evidence of steady inflation before taking another rate hike into consideration  However  Tarullo refused to rule out a rate hike later this year altogether Banks  Insurers to GainRosengreen s hawkish comments led to a broad downturn in stocks on Friday  The S P 500 lost 2 5  on Friday  suffering its worst decline in two months  However  barring an overall market decline  stocks of banks and insurers are likely to gain going forward and such signs are already evident The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index which comprises several large banks  such as Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   and Bank of America   NYSE BAC    increased 7  in August while the S P 500 declined marginally  The index remains in the red year to date but several factors may already be working in the favor of stocks from these sectors A hike in rates will unequivocally benefit banks and insurers  Firstly  profits for banks rise when rates move higher  since their spread will also increase  Secondly  most bank stocks are trading at a cheaper price compared to the overall market  This is also what makes them likely to succeed moving forward  While benchmarks suffered a grievous fall last Friday  the KBW Nasdaq Bank lost only 1  Similarly  the SPDR S P Insurance ETF  KIE  lost slightly more than 1   The index gained more than 4  over the month of August  For insurance companies  investment income forms a major revenue component  A low rate puts pressure on investment income and in turn on investment yields  Hence any increase in the interest rate would lead to gains for insurers   Read  Our ChoicesAt this point  it is difficult to predict whether the Fed will indeed raise rates at its September meeting  But given the tone of the comments of Fed officials  the likelihood of a rate hike in the near term seems to have increased Adding stocks which will gain from higher rates would a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks
