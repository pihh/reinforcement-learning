26905,248420,HOV,Housing Market Review  Seasonal Strength Launches With A Flurry  ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in November  2017 for October  2017  At the time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  traded at a 10  year high with  left far behind in the rear view mirror  The day after my post  Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL    The sell off was enough to knock ITB off its highs  ITB took almost the entire month of December to recover  TOL made a marginal new post earnings high in the past week  but the overall effort to recoup losses looks lackluster  The good news is that support at the uptrending 50 day moving average  DMA  is holding firm 
The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  spent much of December recovering from a Toll Brothers inspired sell off  In the past week  ITB hit a new 10  year high 

Toll Brothers  TOL  is churning post earnings with an ever so subtle upward bias  The 50DMA is still guiding TOL higher 
With bargains hard to find in the housing sector  I went ahead and nibbled on TOL by purchasing a few long dated call options    so the risks shifted firmly in favor of the upside  My position in TOL is a  no regret  position  small enough to cause little pain if the trade fails and large enough to make a dent if the rally continues apace from here 
As the chart of ITB suggests  trading in most home builders was nondescript in December  There were three notable exceptions  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc  NYSE HOV   Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH   and LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  
I rarely track Hovnanian  HOV  given the stock is in single digits and the business has yet to demonstrate much of a post recession recovery  However  the stock caught my attention in December and motivated me to review the overall stock chart  HOV bounced sharply from the financial crisis only to peak a little over a year later  In early 2016  HOV retested the 2011 low  HOV was on its way to a loss for the year until buyers suddenly surged into the stock in the second half of December  The move was a picture perfect bounce off 50DMA support  This trading suggests to me that HOV got caught up in some of the manic moves often seen in single digits stocks in holiday trading  Yet  the rally continued through earnings  with a slight hiccup   HOV gained 38  in the two weeks since it last tested 50DMA support  That is a move I cannot ignore 

Hovnanian  HOV  surged into year end and managed to go positive for the year 
Meritage Homes  MTH  has been at the top of my list for months  but I never got the entry point I wanted  MTH was one of the home builders that soared after the initial angst over the tax plan  The stock almost went parabolic at the end of November on no news that I could find  The cool off period featured a near picture perfect retest of 50DMA support  Given this may be as good as it gets for a dip for a while  I am positioning to start nibbling on MTH in January 
Meritage Homes  MTH  reversed a near parabolic run up in November  The selling ended right at 50DMA support  The stock looks refreshed and ready to run with the next sector rally 
Finally  LGI Homes  LGIH  is the home builder stock that does not know how to quit  This regional builder with a heavy concentration of business in Texas has hit numerous all time highs in the second half of the year  I doubt I can get comfortable at these levels buying back into the stock  but I do like using LGIH as an indicator of the underlying strength of the housing market rally  In particular  LGIH is  burdened  by a short interest that is a massive 38 9  of the float  Skepticism clearly looms large over LGIH  but the momentum keeps shoving that skepticism to the sidelines 

Since June  LGI Homes  LGIH  has only taken a significant pause in August  Otherwise  the stock s march upward has been near relentless 
I was honestly astonished at the synchronized strength in the housing numbers for November  Housing activity picked up in a big way and with it sentiment and confidence  This kind of momentum could be sustainable if wage gains make significant progress in 2018  but that is a big IF  Moreover  consumer and builder sentiment is already at lofty levels  I will be looking closely for what catalysts emerge to continue supporting this robust pace of housing market activity 
   November  2017 Single family housing starts for October were revised upward from 877 000 to 883 000  November starts increased month over month by 5 3  to 930 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts jumped 13 0   representing a quick turn around from October s minimal gain 

Housing starts soared and re energized the existing uptrend 
After three months of non dispersed regional changes  dispersion returned for September  October  and now November  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each changed 6 8    9 9   16 5   and 24 4  respectively in November  The West delivered very strong growth again and provided fresh affirmation of the acute need for more housing in the West s supply constrained markets  The South is back in full throttle after a quick post hurricane recovery 
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  For October  2017  the National Association of Realtors   NAR  delivered a slight twist by applauding another small monthly increase in sales but complained that lack of inventory caused a year over year decline in sales  For November  the NAR delivered another twist by distinguishing between the upper end and the rest of the market to help explain how sales can surge despite the parallel relentless increase in prices 

 Faster economic growth in recent quarters  the booming stock market and continuous job gains are fueling substantial demand for buying a home as 2017 comes to an end The odds of closing on a home are much better at the upper end of the market  where inventory conditions continue to be markedly better Price appreciation is too fast in a lot of markets right now 
The healthy labor market and higher wage gains are expected to further strengthen buyer demand from young adults next year  Their prospects for becoming homeowners will only improve if more lower priced and smaller sized homes come onto the market  

For January 2017  existing home sales rose to levels not seen since February  2007  In February 2017  existing home sales dropped sharply and then rebounded sharply in March to a new post recession high  Sales declined through the summer and convinced me that the top was in for the year  November proved me wrong with existing home sales climbing to a new 11 year high 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 81M were up 5 6  month over month from 5 50M in sales for September  revised up from 5 48M   Year over year sales increased 3 8  which definitively broke a recent pattern of deceleration since April  November 15 4   December 0 7   January 3 8   February 5 4   March 5 9   April 1 6   May 2 7   June 0 7   July 2 1   August 0 2   September  1 5   October  0 9   Suddenly the prospects for the Spring selling season look a lot better than before  However  I will also be looking to see whether marginal buyers are pulling sales into this year to qualify for the grandfathering of tax benefits that will cease to exist for buyers after this year 

Existing home sales soared in November and shattered a peak I assumed would hold until the Spring selling season 
The share of sales going to first time buyers decreased from 32  to 29   This share was also 32  a year ago  but it is the same as September s 29   September was the first time in two years where the share dropped below 30   Yet  the NAR chose THIS month s decline as an opportunity to suggest that the drop may be a sign that investors are crowding out first time homebuyers 

 As evidenced by a subdued level of first time buyers and increased share of cash buyers  move up buyers with considerable down payments and those with cash made up a bulk of the sales activity last month 
The elevated presence of investors paying in cash continues to add a layer of frustration to the supply and affordability headwinds aspiring first time buyers are experiencing  

The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35  and the NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 14  of homes in November which is within the recent range  so I do not yet share the NAR s apparent alarm 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 30th straight month  During November s press conference  the NAR noted that October set a record low absolute and relative inventory level across all Octobers since data collection started in 1999  Recall that during the June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  For this latest report  the NAR made a distinction between the relative availability in higher end markets and the inventory constraints in the rest of the market  So the NAR s fears about declining affordability must be focused below the upper tier of the market 

 The anticipated rise in mortgage rates next year could further cut into affordability if these staggeringly low supply levels persist Price appreciation is too fast in a lot of markets right now  The increase in homebuilder optimism must translate to significantly more new construction in 2018 to help ease these acute inventory shortages  

The 1 67M homes for sale represented a 9 7  decrease from the previous November and a 7 2  decrease from October s already low 1 80M  The string of year over year declines is remarkable  for example  starting from 2016 August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   May  8 4   June  7 1   July  9 0  August  6 5   September  6 4   and October  10 2   These are the declines of an increasingly dysfunctional market that  as the NAR continues to imply  is driving prices to levels that will be hard to sustain without a dramatic improvement in the financial standing of potential home buyers 
In December  2016  inventory hit 3 6 months of sales and a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  Inventory plunged from October s 3 9 months of sales to November s 3 4 months  In the press conference  the NAR indicated it expects a further decline in December  September s inventory was 4 2 months of sales  A year ago inventory sat at 4 0 months  So the current decline is beyond seasonal expectations and represents a relatively rapid disappearance of homes for sale even with the on going downtrend  In the press conference  the NAR noted that current conditions have created winners out of homeowners but losers out of first time home buyers  the on going price gains that are far outpacing wage gains are bad for the long term health of the housing market 
For November  the regional areas experienced flat to strong sales gains  Northeast 0 0   Midwest 6 8   South 4 0   West 2 5   All regions logged substantial year over year jumps in their median price  Northeast 4 0   Midwest 8 8   South 4 8   West 8 2  
November s 5 8  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home amazingly represents the 69th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  248 000 is up slightly from October s  247 000 and another step closer to returning to August s record  253 500 
Single family sales increased 4 5  on a monthly basis and increased on a yearly basis by 3 2   The median price of  248 800 was up 5 4  year over year 

New single family home sales declined in July steeply enough to threaten a break of the years long uptrend  August s hurricane impacted sales numbers seemed to seal the fate of that uptrend  And then September happened  despite broad based declines in existing home sales in September  new home sales soared on both a year over year and month over month basis  October delivered a repeat performance  November essentially confirmed a tremendous resurgence in new home sales that is now synchronized with the resurgence of existing home sales 
The Census Bureau revised October sales of new single family homes significantly downward from 685 000 to 624 000  a second consecutive month with a significant downward revision   New home sales for November increased 17 5  month over month and soared an incredible 26 6  year over year to 733 000  Even if the Census Bureau issues another large downward revision  these numbers solidly confirm the bull run in new home sales is still in full stride  Year over year gains have regularly hit double digits since 2012  November s double digit jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  New home sales hit a new post recession high and have not been this high in over 11 years  Sales have FINALLY returned to 50  of the peak from the last housing bubble  Note well that year to date new home sales have increased 34  while they increased 37  during the entire 4 year period of consolidation for ITB  2013 to 2016  

New home sales surge to 50  of the bubble peak 
In September  new home sales were strong enough to plunge inventory from 6 1 months of supply to 5 0 months  October s inventory slipped slightly to 4 9 months of supply  The exceptionally strong sales volume of November pushed inventory to 4 6 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  so the market has become increasingly unbalanced and creeping toward the same kind of supply crisis besetting existing homes  August s relative inventory was the highest since October  2011  so the current numbers represent a dramatic change in character  I wondered out loud about downward revisions for September and October  Given the tremendous rise in sales in November  I strongly suspect the Census Bureau will issue a significant downward revision again 
For October s sales jump  I was surprised that the median price of a new home actually fell 3 3  from September  and I erroneously reported a year over year decline as well   The Census Bureau made a significant upward revision in the median price from  312 800 to  319 600   not only above September s median but also the fifth highest price of the year  For November  the median fell slightly from October to November s  318 700  a 1 2  year over year gain 
On a regional basis  new home sales returned to divergent behavior and with a vengeance  The Northeast experienced its FOURTH month of sharply higher sales with a 53 3  year over year gain  compare to 65 2  for August  54 8  for September  and 64 7  for October   The Midwest stayed flat at 0 0   The South beat October s post Hurricane gains with a 32 5  year over year surge  The West popped 22 8  year over year 
In March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high at 71  For the remainder of the year  the HMI hovered just under that 12 year high  November s reading of 70 marked a near return to that 12 year high  and now December s reading of 74 blasted the ceiling to send HMI to a level not seen since July  1999  It was a close call  but my  revised  prediction of a new 12  year high by year end rang true  Sentiment was so strong that the NAHB avoided any of its boilerplate caution about rising cost pressures 

 Housing market conditions are improving partially because of new policies aimed at providing regulatory relief to the business community 
With low unemployment rates  favorable demographics and a tight supply of existing home inventory  we can expect continued upward movement of the single family construction sector next year  

The big push higher in sentiment came mostly from the traffic of prospective buyers  This HMI component soared from 50 to 58  Since 2004  the traffic of prospective buyers has spent very little time above 50  Home buyers  shoppers  must be extremely bullish right now even with consumer sentiment cooling off a bit the past few months 

All three components of the HMI rose to multi year highs  The traffic of prospective buyers suddenly surged and now sits well above 50  At the same time  consumer sentiment has trailed off a bit 

For May and June  there was an interesting disparity in the regional changes in HMI  In May  the West finally broke out from the flatline of the previous 4 months with an 80 reading  The West plunged in June back to 71 to a near 1 year low and since then has climbed higher  The West hit 77 for November and soared to 85 for December  This level is still not a multi year high as the West hit 86 last December  In 3 of the last 4 years  the West regional HMI has soared from November  so I am guessing January will deliver a drop large enough to impact overall HMI   The NAHB may need to tweak its seasonal adjustments    The Northeast surged  out of nowhere  to 63 in November from October s 49 and plunged back to 53 for December which was the previous 2017 high set in March  The South moved up to a new high for the year and new 13 year high at 75  The Midwest moved out of its laggard status to jump from November s 65 to December s 76 reading  This level surpassed the previous high for the year of 72 set in March and is by far the highest reading for the Midwest since at least December  2004 
Parting thoughts Housing data and housing stocks are very close in alignment with notable uptrends in place and confirmed for both  The seasonally strong period for housing stocks is on strong footing so far  Yet  the relentless march higher in the price of homes looms as the biggest threat to the health and balance of the market  These out sized price gains are on a slow collision course with higher mortgage rates  Adjustments in the tax incentives for housing will not help and could further exacerbate the issue  Toll Brothers insists that high end customers do not care about the tax implications of home buying   For these reasons  I will not be as aggressive as usual in buying the dips as I normally would during this season  I will likely stay content with the current small portfolio and trade call options in ITB as the primary way to buy into any dips 
California  particularly the San Francisco Bay Area  may be one of the most important housing markets to watch this season  All the negatives of the housing recovery are converging there  A true housing crisis is in full swing with limited supply causing severe imbalances  In September  Governor Jerry Brown signed 15 housing bills in a desperate attempt to address affordability problems throughout the state  Brown acknowledged that even this set of bills is just the beginning of the legislative effort  The latest report from CoreLogic on the Bay Area s housing market provides a stark look into these imbalances for November  As reported by the Mercury News 

 Just when it seemed Bay Area home prices couldn t jump any higher  they soared to dizzying new heights in November   and in the process  set a new record 
The median price for a single family home in the Bay Area last month was  825 000  up nearly 15 percent from the same time last year  according to new data from property analytics company CoreLogic 
That s the most expensive since CoreLogic started keeping track in 1988  surpassing the last record of  823 000 set in June  

The dearth of sales activity is simply startling 

 Just 723 new homes were sold in the region last month  compared to 5 123 older homes  which make up the bulk of the market  And the number of new homes sold dropped more than 14 percent from last year  In San Francisco  just 13 new homes sold last month  compared to 128 in November of last year  

Note that the Bay Area s population is almost 8 million 
Be careful out there

26908,248423,HOV,Low Mortgage Rates Stimulate August New Home Sales  4 Picks,opinion,The struggling housing market is steadily gaining footing  thanks to historically low mortgage rates  After upbeat builder sentiment along with soaring housing starts and existing home sales August data  the latest new home sales data for the month echoes the same sentiment On Sep 25  the Commerce Department stated that sales of newly constructed single family homes for August  accounting approximately 11 5  of total U S  home sales  grew 7 1  from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713 000 units   the second highest level this year  Notably  August sales beat the consensus forecast of 659 000 by 8 2   and grew 18  from the year ago period Declining mortgage rates  moderating home prices  rising wages and the Federal Reserve s dovish stance are reinforcing the U S  housing market Post the release of upbeat data  the Invesco Dynamic Building   Construction ETF  PKB  and iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  ITB  gained 1 2  each  while the SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  NYSE XHB  increased 1   Shares of notable homebuilders such as Hovnanian Enterprises  Inc    NYSE HOV    Beazer Homes

dropped 1 2  from the prior month to 326 000  Nonetheless  housing inventory increased 2 5  from a year ago  It would take just 5 5 months to deplete the current supply of homes  down from 5 9 months in July 2019 and 6 3 months in August 2018 Homebuilders to Counter ChallengesThe housing industry is highly sensitive to interest mortgage rates fluctuations  Per the recent Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey  30 year fixed mortgage rate dropped 120 basis points over a year to an average rate of 3 73  The latest housing statistics   housing starts and building permits   rose an impressive 12 3  and 7 7  in August from July  respectively  the highest level since mid 2007  Moreover  existing home sales jumped to a 17 month high in the same month Although the housing space is caught in the year long trade tussle between the United States and China and is facing shortage of land and skilled labor  August s data has been quite a breather  Additionally  the Federal Reserve s interest rate cut last week for the second time this year to mitigate an economic slowdown is fueling a trend of mortgage refinancing and thereby lending support to household spending 4 Top Housing

Apparently  most American s do because the posts that get the most clicks are the ones with lists and quizzes   I don t do lists very often yet  somehow  I still manage to be fairly popular but let s see what happens when I make a list with a catchy headline 
This list is an update of   which was written on June 6th and originally had 20 trade ideas for the 2nd half of the year   That list quickly grew to 29 and  today  we re adding 11 more to make 40 top stock picks to take us into Q4   Those first 29 picks are already  82  successful with only Hovnanian Enterprises Inc  NYSE HOV   iRobot Corporation  NASDAQ IRBT   Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG   Terex Corporation  NYSE TEX  and The Wendy s Co  NASDAQ WEN  failing to make gains so far and  on average  we re up 72  on our picks in just 3 months   

That s about par for the course with our winning percentages on trade ideas but what makes the Buy List special is that these are the ones we are comfortable committing long term allocation blocks to  not just messing around with short term trading   In fact  our 5  losers  all represent great entry opportunities at lower prices and none are being kicked off the list as our general outlook for these stocks is measured in years  not months   
The strategy we are following is summed up nicely in this video 

As we did in building our   we re not going to rush in and buy everything   We will do exactly what we did in January where  following our Fall Buy List  we simply added stocks from our list whenever they became cheap   While our Members are able to pick up our trade ideas as they are released  we don t always add them to our virtual portfolios right away ",2014-09-02,Philip Davis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-buy-list:-40-of-the-world’s-best-stock-values-224442,224442
27032,248547,HOV,Does Upbeat Housing Data Signal Better 2H For Homebuilders ,opinion,"The housing recovery seems to be picking up after a softer than expected spring selling season  The buyers are back in the market now that they are more confident of a recovering economy and an improving job market  Still low interest rates act as a further stimulus for home buying in spite of the Fed scaling back its bond buying program  The housing slowdown that began in the second half of 2013 was further handicapped by severe weather conditions  a biting winter and declining demand for homes in the first half of 2014  This raised serious doubts about the strength of the housing market  Moreover  shortage of lots and skilled labor  rising costs of materials and declining inventory of new homes were not making things easier for the builders  Also  the spike in mortgage rates and rising home prices were hurting demand  which further added to the woes  As a result  many homebuilders witnessed declining order trends in the December quarter  As the winter chill subsided  several homebuilders recorded improving order trends in the March quarter  However  the spring selling season failed to deliver on its promise as large homebuilders like Lennar Corp   NYSE LEN  and PulteGroup  Inc   NYSE PHM   saw a sequential decline in order growth in the June 2014 quarter  Also  some negative housing reports around that time indicated skepticism among home buyers  Pending home sales  new home sales  single family houses  and housing starts as well as building permits all declined in June  However  a slew of data released in August raises hope that that the housing market recovery might finally be back on track  Housing starts surged to an 8 month high in July  growing 15 7  from the prior month to an annualized rate of 1 093 million units  The July increase beat market expectations and came as a breather from the declines seen in the past two months  Building permits  a gauge of future construction  also bucked the previous trend  After declining in June  building permits grew 8 1  in July  Homebuilder confidence data for August hit its highest level since January  clearly indicating that builders are upbeat about their prospects for future sales  Homebuilders  confidence  as indicated by the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Wells Fargo housing market index  rose 2 points to 55 in August  New homes inventory for sale rose 4 1  to 205 000 units in July  This is a 6 month supply at the current sales pace   the highest so far this year   which suggests that the supply picture is also improving  Sale of existing homes rose 2 4  in July  for the fourth consecutive month this year  Pending home sales rose 3 3  in July after declining in June  having risen now in four of the past five months 
However  sales of new single family homes in the U S  dipped 2 4  in July  The decline was below market expectations and was quite a surprise considering that other housing indicators have been on the rise  Kevin Kelly  chairman of NAHB  resonated that new home sales is a  volatile metric that can fluctuate significantly from month to month   According to Kelly  the higher inventory levels suggest that builders are improving their inventory anticipating improvement in new home sales through the balance of the year  It is generally believed that the construction gains should continue through the rest of the year driven by rising home demand  stabilizing mortgage rates this year  improving job market  good pricing environment and rising inventory levels OPPORTUNITIES Firming Home Prices   Stabilized Mortgage Rates Can Spur Demand Home prices have been rising in 2014 albeit at moderating rates  The median home price increased 4 9  year over year in July  down from a 13 1  gain last year  Another report from the S P Case Shiller home price data for June also showed a persistent slowdown in price increases  The year over year reading for the 20 city index showed price increases of 8 1   well below the 9 3  increase in the year ago month  Each of the 20 cities saw annual price growth slowdown for the first time since early 2008  Meanwhile  mortgage rates have remained low this year even though the Fed continues to withdraw support from the system by scaling back its bond buying program  According to the Freddie Mac mortgage survey  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate has gone down from 4 43  in January to 4 13  in July  Though mortgage rates are higher than the average rate in 2013  they are still below historical levels  making housing affordable  The rising inventory  low mortgage rates and moderating home prices are expected to give homebuyers much needed confidence  paving the way for higher home demand in the second half of the year Land as Native Strength Homebuilders like Lennar and Toll Brothers  Inc   NYSE TOL  with solid land positions  have been able to better capitalize on rising demand for homes during the upturn  This gave these companies a competitive edge over the likes of Pulte  which faced land availability constraints  Toll Brothers has secured some of the most sought after urban locations in the country   New York City  Northern New Jersey  Philadelphia and Washington D C    where land is scarce and approvals are not easy to obtain  Lennar has enough land in all major markets to satisfy deliveries well into 2015  However  others like Pulte have intentionally slowed down the sales pace across some of their communities  thus lowering the community count  due to a lack of land development and scarcity of finished lots  Instead  Pulte has been more focused on driving price and margin in most communities 
This strategy hurt net order growth significantly with orders declining around 10  in fiscal 2013   as against the increase enjoyed by most of its peers  Pulte s orders declined a further 4  in the first half of 2014  Though the price optimization initiatives are improving Pulte s pricing and profits  the below average order growth raises concerns about the soundness of its strategy  Other homebuilders have realized the importance of land investments  Small homebuilder Ryland Group  Inc   RYL  has spent  258 million on land acquisition and  166 million on site development in the first half of 2014  Texas based D R  Horton  Inc  DHI  invested  2 6 billion in land  lots and development in 2013 and  1 7 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2014  positioning it well to meet demand for fiscal years 2014 and 2015  
California based KB Home  NYSE KBH  spent  1 14 billion in land investment in fiscal 2013 and around  860 million so far in 2014  In fact  aggressive land investments helped KB Home record better order trends in its first half of 2014 after a soft 2013 High End Homes Driving Prices Many homebuilders like Lennar  KB Home and Toll Brothers have shifted their focus on high end communities  primarily in California  Arizona  Colorado and Florida  which allow them to sell larger  higher priced homes  driving the ASPs up  Homebuilders like KB Home and D R  Horton are also shifting focus from first time buyers to higher income  move up buyers who demand larger  higher priced and more upgraded homes and are more likely to qualify for home loans  Pulte is shifting its focus towards its high priced Pulte branded  move up and Del Webb branded active adult homes  which improve the overall ASP  Also  Pulte is building some new commonly managed communities that represent homes that have been constructed under the company s more efficient design  cost and build processes and thus generate better margins and volumes than the non commonly managed communities  Another small homebuilder  Meritage Homes Corp   NYSE MTH    is also seeing improving selling prices from a mix shift towards move up homes in higher priced communities and states  Luxury home builder Toll Brothers is focused on improving the quality and luxury quotient of its homes  thus giving it a competitive advantage Healthy Margins Offset Weak Volumes Though volumes were soft in the June quarter  home prices remained strong which along with a favorable mix  tight cost control and improved efficiencies boosted the overall margins for many homebuilders  Most housing companies are striving to improve their operating and financial performance through strategic restructuring initiatives  The initiatives taken include workforce reductions  improving overhead leverage  managing inventory tightly and implementing new pricing strategies  The homebuilders expect these cost reduction and operating efficiency improvement plans combined with improved housing demand to continue to boost profitability in the second half WEAKNESSESSupply Constraints A shortage of approved home sites  labor constraints in some markets and a lack of available capital for smaller builders are lowering the supply of homes  both new and existing  The supply of homes is still not adequate to meet current demand leave alone pent up demand  If supply fails to improve  home prices could shoot up further  causing many homebuyers to hold back their purchase decisions Slow Economic Recovery Sustainable revival in housing and housing demand for the long term will require the overall economy to strengthen  This means further job growth  improving household income  rising consumer confidence and easing of credit availability  The economy though on the mend is far from a full fledged recovery  The lending environment is still overly restricted for certain borrowers  Until there is a more robust economic recovery  new home sales would continue to lag historical levels Rising Labor  Land and Material Costs Rising building materials and labor costs are an increasing margin headwind  As housing starts accelerate  both labor and construction material costs continue to drive prices higher  This could eat into the margins of the homebuilders in the forthcoming quarters  Most homebuilders expect higher land and construction costs in 2014 How Did the Major Players Fare Last Earnings Season  The June quarter was rather soft for the homebuilders  as demand for homes belied expectations in the spring selling season  Pulte missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues due to a decline in net orders and the number of closings along with a higher tax rate  Higher closings and pricing gains helped D R  Horton beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues  However  earnings missed the consensus mark and declined year over year  Higher incentives  reduced gross margins  higher SG A ratio and massive inventory land impairment charges in the Chicago market hurt quarterly earnings  Management had increased incentives to quicken the sales pace in the quarter  Though the strategy worked well for order trends  it took a toll on gross margins  Others like Lennar and KB Home beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the second quarter helped mainly by strong pricing and solid margins  While Lennar s order trends declined sequentially due to a softer than expected spring selling season  KB Home s orders improved sequentially in the second quarter  Among smaller homebuilders  New Jersey based Hovnanian Enterprises Inc   NYSE HOV  and California based Ryland Group Inc  NYSE RYL  missed expectations on both the top and bottom line  While higher SG A ratio and a decline in the sales pace per community hit Hovnanian s results  Ryland suffered from a soft order trend  Others like Beazer Homes USA Inc   NYSE BZH    Meritage Homes and NVR  Inc   NYSE NVR   performed relatively better in the quarter   beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues  Higher sales prices  improved gross margins and better overhead leverage helped these companies outperform expectations  Toll Brothers  profits more than doubled in the just

term neutral outlook   the neutral stance reflects an improving home sales environment after it stalled for a while in the first half of the year Earnings Trends If we look at the overall results of the Construction sector  earnings shot up 14 2  in the June quarter from a 7 9  rise in the March quarter  Total revenues declined at a slower pace of 0 2  in the quarter than the 1 2  decline in the

27033,248548,HOV,Company Notes Digest  Housing Demand Continues To Be Weak,opinion,"The Macro Outlook
Toll Brothers concedes that they re disappointed by how housing has done this year
 Looking back at the last year and thinking about the growth that we saw in 2013 and how deep and dark and long this last housing depression was  we thought the pent up demand would continue to build and 2014 would be a significantly better year than 2013  And I think if you ask any CEO of any of the big public  they would tell you the same thing  So are we disappointed in flat or slightly negative order growth  The honest answer is yes    Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  
Traffic was strong though  indicating that there might be interest in housing from a broader group of consumers
 We are encouraged by our traffic This pattern has continued into August with traffic up 19  per community versus last August  it s an indication that the whole market is playing with housing again  not just the exclusive those who can afford it and are not trapped in the homes that they re in    TOL 
Housing demand continues to be weak because prices are high and income growth is low

And mortgage underwriters are slowly starting to take a little more risk
 We have seen some green shoots and some good news on the self employed front  We re actually seeing people come out with products targeted to self employed people and no verification of income loans with 30  down and good credit scores  But instead of just not looking at the borrower at all  they re looking at cash flows  It will take 12 months  worth of bank statements to ensure that the person really has the cash flow regardless of their tax return  So I think that s really good news  and frankly I think it s prudent   TOL 
 the third party mortgage companies are hungry for deals  and they have been very competitive on rates  and that s causing some competition    HOV 
Don t forget  we have a midterm election coming up in November
 The election hasn t come to the front of the brain yet  But it s getting there and I wouldn t be surprised as we come closer to the election that we start to focus on the great number of things  There will a lot of promises made for sure    TOL

 For example  in terms of hospital acquired infections  you see a particular facility that s excelling at reducing hospital acquired infections  Well what are they doing  What are their protocols  What are their approaches  And then sitting down with physicians and other hospitals that may not have that sort of performance and showing them the data and moving them closer  if not into the best practices range  So that s just one example  kind of benchmarking sort of techniques    HCA Holdings Inc  NYSE HCA

Large not for profit hospitals are focused on creating integrated healthcare networks
 Some of the large  not for  profit competitors in the market spend more time  I guess  thinking about maybe narrow networks  more in terms of physician strategies in terms of clinical integrated networks   HCA 
The trend of hospitals directly employing doctors may be slowing down a little though
 Physician employment continues to increase although at a much lower rate than we were seeing probably five  six years ago quite frankly  when you think about HCA and our physician relationships  we have  I mentioned  35 000 active physicians on our medical staff  And so we can t employ all those physicians   HCA 
If you re not employing doctors directly  you have to create facilities that they want to work at
 what we re looking at is  how do we make our facilities the place that they want to work  If they re a surgeon or they re a physician that would perform their services within the walls of our hospital  how do we make our facility the best facility for them    HCA

27035,248550,HOV,Will Homebuilding Be Hit By A 2015 Rate Hike ,opinion,"Though the housing market has recovered dramatically from the trough year of 2009  it is still below historical levels  held back by stringent mortgage underwriting and low levels of consumer confidence 
While both show signs of improvement and the outlook for the U S  market in general and the housing sector in particular remains favorable going into 2015  concerns regarding a possible rise in interest mortgage rates in 2015 cannot be shaken off now that the Fed has ceased its bond buying program  This could start weighing on the sector s performance and should be taken into consideration before investing in this space  Below  we discuss some of these reasons and what investors may expect in the coming months and years Federal Government Actions The Federal government s actions related to economic stimulus  taxation  as well as borrowing limits could affect consumer confidence and spending levels which  in its turn  could hurt the economy and the housing market   Currently  the probability of a rise in short term interest rates in 2015 is very high considering the fact that the Fed has ended its six year long quantitative easing program in October  Though the Fed had earlier assured that the key interest rate will be kept at the record low level for a  considerable time   investors have started speculating about the timing of the planned rate hike  It may well be sooner than expected in 2015  Higher interest mortgage interest rates may have a moderating effect on housing demand and pricing Slow Economic Recovery Sustainable revival in housing and housing demand for the long term will require the overall economy to strengthen  This means further job growth  improving household income  rising consumer confidence and easing of credit availability  The economy though on the mend   with all these factors showing signs of improvement   is far from a complete recovery 
Despite moderate improvement in economic growth  consumers are spending only modestly  as a surge in job growth this year is yet to translate into significantly higher wages  The lending environment is still overly restricted for first time homebuyers  High down payments and strict underwriting standards are restricting access to the mortgage markets  Until there is a more robust economic recovery  new home sales would continue to lag historical levels Supply Constraints A shortage of approved home sites  labor constraints in some markets and a lack of available capital for smaller builders are reducing the supply of homes  both new and existing  The supply of homes is still not adequate to meet current demand leave alone pent up demand  If supply fails to improve  home prices could shoot up further  causing many homebuyers to hold back their purchase decisions Rising Labor  Land and Material Costs Rising building materials and labor costs are an increasing margin headwind  As housing starts to accelerate  both labor and construction material costs continue to increase  This could eat into the margins of the homebuilders in the forthcoming quarters  Most homebuilders expect higher land and construction costs next year What do the Builders Say  Despite the headwinds  homebuilder D R  Horton  NYSE DHI  considers the current housing market conditions as  relatively stable   PulteGroup  Inc   NYSE PHM  expects a  sustained albeit gradual recovery in housing demand  
Lennar Corp   LEN  believes the housing market is recovering at a slow pace  though moving upward in a fairly narrow channel  Hovnanian Enterprises  Inc   NYSE HOV  believes that they are in the  early stages of the housing industry recovery  

Interestingly  according to California based homebuilder  KB Home  NYSE KBH   the housing recovery  varies significantly on a local basis  with some areas demonstrating strong demand  while other areas witness softer volumes Bottom Line As you can see there is a long way to go for these homebuilders despite a recovering economic picture  But what about investing in the space right now   will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure in the short term investors Disclosure  Check out our latest Housing Industry Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now ",2014-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-homebuilding-be-hit-by-a-2015-rate-hike-236029,236029
27036,248551,HOV,Chart Carnage  Home Builders Under Duress,opinion,"When I decided to start writing a monthly summary of the status of the housing market  I had assumed that housing was going to remain in or settle into a general holding pattern  I assumed little was going to happen to the upside or the downside for a while  Under those conditions  it did not make sense to rush to analyze every housing report the minute it arrived  As luck would have it  I made this switch just ahead of all heck breaking loose in the stock market  Ironically  I even used the term  coiled spring  to describe the stasis in the market 
This has been a tough time for the stock market  As investors connect dots across negative drivers to draw a picture of a looming economic calamity  cyclical sectors have taken their own special pounding  Home builders have quickly gone from a state of serene market out performance to a rude awakening to what in some cases are multi year lows  The most hapless stocks are trading back to levels last seen when housing was still rising out of its 2012 trough 
Pictures speak loudly  I have posted below monthly charts of all the home builder stocks I follow the most  I placed a black horizontal line at the most recent intra day low to provide a reference to the depth of the current selling  The captions include the name of the home builder and the price to book ratio pulled from Yahoo Finance  Notice the large divergence in performance and valuation  The market has quickly priced in the most trouble for the smallest and or most regionally concentrated builders  Suddenly  diversification and size are clear kings of the lots  LGI Homes  O LGIH  is still a notable exception

I have used this extreme oversold period to pick up new positions in home builders and add to existing positions  I am compelled to take advantage of the discounts when so many builders are trading at or below book value  Of course things could get worse if indeed an economic calamity is around the corner  but I am not expecting one  Things could also get worse if my concerns over the potential of a more extended sell off in the stock market play out  Under such dire scenarios I will find another buying spot to buy into the eventual recovery
