over to Guillermo  his opening comments  Guillermo Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Seth  and good morning to everyone  It s an exciting and dynamic time here at Ashland and I m incredibly energized by what we have accomplished and the opportunities that lie ahead  I want to thank the Ashland team for the strong support and enthusiasm you have demonstrated during this transition Today  I ll start with comments about the high level drivers of our performance in Q1  then discuss the business realignment that continues as we speak  Following my remarks  I ll turn the call over to Kevin to take you through the details Q1 performance was below prior year driven by softer market demand  prior year carryover items  and our catalyst change at our Lima facility  We experienced no significant surprises in Q1  other than the extended turnaround costs at our Lima facility as a result of an unexpected need for additional maintenance work  We had another strong quarter in terms of EH S performance and we continue to advance our sustainability objectives in terms of innovation and operations As expected  market demand remains soft in the quarter in both the industrial and consumer markets  In Pharma  we had a difficult comp relative to a very strong prior year Q1 and saw some customers adjust their inventory levels  In Personal Care  we continue to see demand softness in hair care  In oral care  results were stronger than planned driven by some new product introductions by key customers  For adhesives  we saw general softness across most segments  especially transportation but the construction market was strong  We continue to see deflationary pressures in both pricing and raw material costs  Coatings demand remained soft during the quarter As we communicated we also had the prior year carryover headwinds of business losses and tailwinds of improved cost  From a cost perspective  we continue to realize benefits from the cost reduction program and have begun taking additional cost improvement actions  I will talk more about these actions later in the call Now I d like to speak to you about the progress we have made realigning Ashland s business structure  Please turn to Slide 7  As we discussed during the last call  we are moving from a functional model to a business led one  As part of this change  we are putting in place a new business structure to better align strategy  resources  and capital allocation and improve execution  This change recognizes that we have a diverse portfolio of specialty businesses  with different profiles and requirements to drive success  This will move decision making and accountability to the business units and their leaders  Incentive compensation will be heavily aligned to business unit results  In forming the teams  we are leveraging our internal talent and complementing it with targeted external talent  I m very pleased with the progress we ve made in such a short period of time Please turn to Slide 8  Our business will be made up of the following  the Consumer Specialties group will include our Life Science and our Personal Care and Household business units  Note that the Life Science BU will hold our current Pharma and Health and Wellness businesses  The Health and Wellness business will include Ashland s core food additives business as well as Pharmachem s nutrition activities  Personal Care and Household BU will include Ashland s existing businesses as well as the Avoca fixative business from Pharmachem The Industrial Specialties group will be made up of our Specialty Additives and Performance Adhesives business units  Specialty Additives will contain our coatings  construction and performance additives business lines  Performance Adhesives will remain unchanged We will continue to run our Intermediates and Solvents business as a separate segment and business  Although we will allocate to the businesses    business units some of the corporate managed cost linked to their operating activities like IT  HR  EH S and other functions  we will have a corporate segment that holds all corporate governance costs  Note that in addition to aligning our resources to the businesses  we are also aligning our core assets to them  Each business will be accountable for the operations and performance of the assets in their business and for the supply of all the demand of the other business units Please turn to Slide 9  this business model change will be a fundamental change in how we run our businesses and the company  We expect these changes to increase our focus and in true    and in turn improve decision making  our agility  and build ownership and  Technical Issues  Business units will own their strategies and be accountable for their operating performance  This is not a one size fits all model  they will have the dedicated resources and full empowerment to make decisions  including their business models and cost structures  The intent is for the new business structures to better align strategy resources and capital allocation  and of course improve execution  Aligning our incentive compensation to the line of sight of our business units and their teams is also a significant change  Their decisions and actions drive our performance and as such  BU incentive comp will be heavily aligned to the business unit s results  We have accomplished a lot in a short period of time  All the General Managers  have been selected and will all be in place starting February 1  We have defined the business units  their teams and aligned their assets and we re now in the process of finalizing the financials As part of the actions taken  we have started to reduce our cost structure  For this coming quarter  we will be focused on operationalizing the new business units  We expect them to update all their strategies and define their business models and cost structure  As BUs take control of their operations  we will begin the process of rightsizing other corporate structures Let me now pass the call over to Kevin to review our results and then I ll come back with some closing comments  Kevin J  Kevin Willis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Guillermo and good morning everyone  If you will  please turn to Slide 12  First  I ll begin with a broad overview of results during the quarter  As you may recall  the December quarter is our seasonal trough during the year as demand tends to be slowest as our customers manage inventory in anticipation of planned downtime at their facilities  We also schedule much of our planned downtime to coincide with our customers planning  This quarter was no different and our results demonstrate the same normal seasonality patterns that we would expect That being said and as expected heading into the quarter  global demand in both consumer and industrial end markets remained weak  We also continue to work through the business losses that occurred last year at both Pharmachem and within the Personal Care end market  We did however  realize continued improvements to our cost structure as both SG A and raw material costs were down compared to the prior year  While overall results were consistent with expectations  they were below the result of last year s December quarter Please turn to Slide 13  total Ashland sales in the quarter were  533 million  down 7  from the year ago period due to lower sales in Specialty Ingredients  Negative currency represented one point of this decline  SG A costs again declined significantly in the quarter as we realized positive impact of the cost reduction program  including the benefit of eliminated stranded costs  We did incur higher than anticipated costs during the planned catalyst changeover at the Lima  Ohio facility with Intermediates   Solvents  Total Ashland s adjusted EBITDA was  88 million compared to  100 million in prior year  Adjusted EPS was  0 13  down a  0 01 from the prior year  Our tax rate was favorable due to income mix and the benefit of discrete tax items Now let s look at the segment results in the first quarter  Please turn to Slide 14  Specialty Ingredients sales were  505 million  down 9  versus prior year  due primarily to weaker demand in both consumer and industrial end markets  plus the prior year business losses which I already referenced  Gross profit margin benefited from lower raw material costs  though this was somewhat offset by unfavorable product mix  Favorable price versus raws continues to be a good story for Specialty Ingredients as the commercial teams have been diligent during a prolonged period of raw material volatility  Operating income and EBITDA both declined versus prior year as lower gross profit was partially offset by lower SG A costs  All in  EBITDA margin was basically flat at 20 2  Please turn to Slide 15  Turning to Intermediates   Solvents  sales in the quarter were  28 million  up 22  from the year ago period  though the December quarter last year was particularly weak for the I S segment  As previously mentioned  the planned catalyst changeover  plus the unexpected maintenance work at Lima resulted in  12 million of additional costs versus prior year  As a result  both gross profit and EBITDA were negative during the quarter  The good news is that the plant returned to normal operations during the quarter and no additional costs are expected    related to this maintenance work Now I d like to review some important balance sheet work that we ve recently completed  please turn to Slide 17  To improve our debt maturity profile and better match the currency of our earnings assets and liabilities  in January we issued  500  Phonetic  million of unsecured euro denominated bonds at 2   We also finalized a new unsecured US credit facility consisting of a  250 million term loan A and  600 million revolver  We use these proceeds to retire approximately  766 million of higher rate debt this month  This move extends maturities and reduces our weighted average cost of debt as well as cash interest expense  It also provides a natural hedge for our euro denominated balance sheet and income statement  We expect this refinancing to result in approximately  18 million to  20 million of lower cash interest expense on an annual basis  This Euro bond issuance debut is an important step as it demonstrates new capital sourcing options for Ashland outside the US Please turn to Slide 19  and I will now turn the call back over to Guillermo for his closing comments  Guillermo Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Kevin  As we discussed in our last call  our key objectives are to drive profitable growth  driven by organic sales and adjusted EBITDA growth  margin expansion and improved cash flow generation Please turn to Slide 20  my priorities continue to be to develop and articulate our strategy for our business and the company  to improve our operating performance and to align and right size our cost structures to the needs of our business and run as a best in class company for our size and profile  and to maintain a disciplined capital allocation focus  Most importantly  we want to move with a strong sense of urgency and ensure that our actions result in visible improvement momentum in our performance Please turn to Slide 20  our near term focus is very clear  First of all  is to enable our business units  This is at the core of driving fundamental improvement in our results  If our business units are focused and performing well  this will drive core value creation  We are targeting to have them fully operational with their new strategies  plans  and structures by early fiscal Q3  We will drive cost improvement actions    it s important to note that our company has undergone significant portfolio changes for a long time We recognize that the organization is a bit fatigued with change because of this we want to make sure that we move with urgency on the finding our future structures and implementing the cost actions we plan to take  We will be acting on cost across four levels of the company  The first level is around our BUs  BUs will drive setting their business models and improving their direct cost structures  Second  as the BUs define their needs and service levels requirements  we will take action on corporate managed costs that are allocated to the business based on these new service levels  Third  we will ensure we have in place a best in class governance structures and costs in line with a  2 billion to  3 billion company of our profile  It s also important to note that although we are a smaller company now  we do have some legacy costs from our history  We will ensure that we have the appropriate cost structure to manage these legacy activities efficiency    efficiently and effectively  And lastly  we re going to focus on driving our operating performance  Although the business units will drive the core operations  we do have some specific challenges where I plan to spend more time  One would be addressing revenue growth on a few challenged businesses  Another area is about accelerating productivity initiatives  and the last area is improving our working capital and getting opportunities to impact free cash flow Please turn to Slide 22  As I ve outlined our focus for 2020 is very clear  Our number one priority is to take the necessary self help actions that will drive near term and long term performance improvement for our company  We will move with focus and a strong sense of urgency  We are still finalizing the financials for our new business  which will be critical for the work that lies ahead  We already have a lot of issues we need to address  but there is still more work to define other actions we need to take and dimension both their near term and long term impact  As such  we will not be providing guidance In terms of the outlook  we will provide the following insights  Although there is still a lot of macro uncertainty based on current assumptions we expect market demand to start improving  especially in the second half of the year  We continue to make progress on new business development and innovation  which will support our underlying business  We expect pricing and raw material dynamics to stay balanced  At a minimum  we expect to see the  25 million SG A carryover improvement  but we will work to expand that impact throughout the year with new cost actions  We will begin to act on some working capital improvement initiatives  especially on inventory  This will liberate cash  but we still need to dimension the operating impact these actions may have  For our Q2 call  we plan to present the new business structures and give further color on our strategy and path forward Please turn to Slide 24  Although there is clearly room to improve our performance  we are already a premier specialty materials company  We have an enviable portfolio of businesses focused on high quality markets with exciting growth opportunities  We have leadership positions in our core markets  with strong and experienced teams  customer relationships  and innovation capabilities  We already have a profitable and high margin portfolio and our businesses generate strong free cash flow  Our focus now is on making a good thing even better I want to thank all of you for your interest and support  And I also want to thank    give a very special thank you to everyone in the Ashland team  Your support and dedication is greatly appreciated  Note that together  we will be making Ashland an even better company where we can innovate with our customers and grow together  Your work counts and is critical to our future  so thank you very much Operator  let s move to Q A Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse  your line is open Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you So Guillermo  we understand you ve only been on the ground for a few weeks  but we also know you re familiar with some of these platforms from your past experiences  just given investor concerns regarding systematic business loss due to some Pharmachem weakness  can you just give us a quick review of your perspectives on the longer term competitive positioning of the ASI portfolio by end market  particularly in the Life Sciences and PC H platforms Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Yeah  I would highlight two big items in terms of some of the events that happened last year and I think we talked about it a little bit in the last call  And first is yes  we had some business impact in our portfolio  but we did not lose share to competition  it s not like we re not playing our game  We lost business because some of our customers made reformulations and took some of the business internally  So if you look at    actually the core businesses across the portfolio  we are still in a very good position  There is the normal puts and takes of share wins  share losses that happened  We don t go into that level of detail on an ongoing basis  but I m pretty confident that  if you look at some of our core business in Pharma  in Coatings  in Adhesives  we re doing very well and a lot of our traditional construction and other such segments  So I m not as concerned that there s something systematically broken Now the oral care  we are addressing its now a capacity  it s done  We actually    versus our plans  we had a better quarter than we had planned through innovation  new products  customers are taking some of our newer technology  So the teams now  that s one of the areas that I want the new business units and leadership teams to focus and really make sure that we re getting more traction  I think we can get much more leverage out of our innovation investments that we re making that I don t think we are where we need to be in those    in    in those areas On the Pharmachem side  I    you know this is one of the areas that I need to spend more time  We have an issue there  I mean there is no doubt that this is a more structural and I d rather comment that in the next calls as we move forward  but clearly  we have some good businesses that are stable  We look at our active ingredients business  the margins can improve but it s a stable business that we can    we can grow  In some of our fixative business and some of our custom manufacturing obviously  we ve had some bigger challenges  There s a lot of great technology there  especially if you look at our Avoca business to grow into    taken into new directions  but this is going to take a period of time  So this is definitely an area where we ll spend a little bit more time and effort Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  And just as a corollary of that question  For those investors that concerned about the long term growth profile of the ASI platform  what do you believe are the overall macro key thematic top line drivers we should be monitoring and what s your general thought process regarding how long it will take senior management  the new business unit heads to better align the company s cost structure with that outlook  Thank you Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think on the cost and organization  the expectation is that we ll move quickly on those  So within this year  I d like to see most of those things in place  I think the ones that you re going to have probably a broader timeline some things we can do now  some things that will take a year  something that might take a little bit longer is more on the corporate side  We can    structural things we can do certain footprint changes or even if you want to change our IT strategy  things of those nature take a little bit more time  So that area I think you re going to have a broader spectrum  but definitely on the business side  the cost part will be very critical  I think we should be getting much more benefit on the revenue side on focus and that s been the experience that I ve had with other businesses that we ve gone through this transformation Obviously the innovation one is the part that is a longer lead time and that s why we re moving with urgency  the sooner we can get to it  the better  The good news there is that we actually do have really great capabilities  every lab facility they go  the projects that we re working on  I think it s about getting more traction  but there s a lot of exciting things that are going on that are probably not as visible to the outside and that s one of the things that we want to show our investors and our customers on the things that we re doing  These are things like innovation around sustainability about biodegradable products  it s about natural products  new pharma products to help our customers improve productivity in the manufacturing of their pills  expanding into markets on bio    on injectables in the pharma area  In Coatings  we have a real premier group in Realogy  competed against them for a long time  They re expanding into other technologies to expand the portfolio  So there is a lot of exciting things  that s why I m very excited  The sooner we can get through some of these cost actions and restructuring  the sooner we can get to the real exciting stuff  which is really about innovation and organic growth Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you very much OperatorThank you  And our following question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets  your line is open John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  thanks for taking my question  With regards    you had indicated there    there was some opportunities around the working capital side  I guess can you give us some preliminary thoughts on where you think you can actually make the improvements there  And if you can quantify it at all Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  that s    the part of quantifying is why we re not being specific on some targets yet  but if you just look at our balance sheet and the inventory levels relative to others  other companies  we have a high inventory level and especially if you look in some of our bigger asset plants  that s where we want to focus and it s not an insignificant amount  Now the issue is what actions do we take commercially moving the material  if we    if it impacts running our plants  That s the balance of things that we want to do and this is something I need the new business groups to really to own and drive  So that s part of the timeline issues that we need to work through John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  And then just as a follow up  So when you think about the key issues that it may be    that maybe caused the company to struggle a little bit in certain areas  do you think it s a lack of focus or do you think it s a lack of investment and if it s on the investment side  how much    how much do you think you have to put into actually kind of revitalize the platform  Or is it really just getting the right people in the right places Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don t think it s an investment question  If you look at our R D investments  the levels that we have  If you look at our    the capital investments we re doing  our plants are well positioned  we re adding capacity as needed  So that s not the issue  I think it is an issue of focus  I mean it s very    even before we put all the business in place just changing how we re looking at our income statements and balance sheets by businesses and aligning them we have smart people that are involved in these businesses  They re seeing the issues and they are already moving on it  We re not waiting on some of these things  I think the biggest disconnect and when we say focus  it s not the people weren t doing their thing  it s that    when you have these functional organizations in niche business  specialty business like these where everything is actually very interconnected  our sales  our innovation  our manufacturing decisions  these are big customers that we re working with  it s much more intimate If you re in the commercial side and you re just looking at revenue and contribution margin  you will    you try to make the right decision based on those things  but what happens when you generate business that is short term  increases sales and contribution margin  but it costs you a lot of extra costs to deliver that and you make no money on those transactions  The group s don t have that full view of the P L and that s really the fundamental change If you go down  it s not that we re not focused with marketing people that don t know their space or that we have R D people that don t know their technology or the customer interaction  It s connecting all that in a much more one focus  one agenda that we re attempting to do  And frankly  we re already seeing benefits of just changing the narrative  internally and that will help us bring more traction John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  thanks very much for the color OperatorThank you  And our following question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank  your line is open David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you  Good morning  Guillermo  I know you re putting out    Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGood morning  I know you re not putting out targets  but the prior team had a longer term margin target for the year  specialty ingredient business of 25  to 27   is that still reasonable or is that even to low perhaps in your longer term thinking of the potential of Ashland Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think as we said in the last call  I mean  we re not changing our targets  that s still the target  I think that there s opportunities to do more than that  especially as we look at each of the business units  This is    a lot of the discussion of costs has been really around our corporate structures and all that  Actually  it s really about the business model  service levels  things that we want to do differently across the different business units  So I think as was the case with the prior company I was in the bigger surprise really came out of those activities where    that were much more intimate to the business and that provided some upside momentum  both in terms of costs and in terms of mix improvement David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystVery good  And just on the innovation engine and pipeline  Guillermo when would you hope that will begin to really impact the top line  is it a few quarters  is it longer than that perhaps  what s your timeline for that improvement Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe are trying now to support the key initiatives  So we re identifying  which are the major projects  major initiatives  how do we focus on them to accelerate them so that we can increase the level of impact and I think the other issue is for the business units  It s    not surprising I mean for some of you that look at this across many companies  just aligning now our incentive comp and our actions to business units  I can guarantee you that there s going to be a different sense of urgency for each of those businesses  because the majority of    their line of sight  they re going to be rewarded for it  What they do matters and that just creates a very positive sense of urgency across the organization that we want to foster and develop  So I think we can move much faster I think the things that will take longer are more as we step back and this is something that I ll work with our CTO on more of the portfolio is    are there some changes that we want to shift into bigger activities are we doing    got a lot of great projects on sustainability  where can we do more on some of these areas  especially in the consumer side  where this is a business imperative  as we move forward  So there s a lot of exciting things    I think we have a lot of options  because of the core capabilities we have  So that puts us in a good position to choose  We re not having to start things from scratch at this point in time David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  And our following question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo  your line is now open Mike Sison    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHey  guys  I ll come back    just curious  I know you ve got a lot of things going on in terms of improving the company  but when is a reasonable timeframe to start to see EBITDA growth for Ashland  should you see some of this year  second half or is it really a 2021 event Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think two things that    I mean three points that I would make  One is we ve been focused really on all these things that happened last year  we stabilize it so that we re not getting any more negative surprises and that this quarter we ve seen that  And as the business teams go  my level of confidence increases because we re going to have very focused teams addressing those issues  I think that the second issue is going to be just general market demand that the    there is still a lot of uncertainty  but all the indications are most of the markets are starting to improve and especially in the second half that will help us drive EBITDA growth  But the most important part and we don t control that  that will be the market I think is really our self help actions and it s on both the prior question and on the discussion of our cost actions that we need to take  Making    getting the businesses focused  so they can drive their portfolio with what I would call the exciting EBITDA growth drivers  which is really the revenue and the innovation mix improvement drivers that they have and they are already developing  they are already identifying things that they can do And second is obviously on the cost side of things  the actions that we need to take  So those self help actions  So if you look at the timeline  I think the second half of the year is where we re going to see the biggest benefit  What we ve been trying to do as you ve seen now is to show  I know there s been a lot of concern of    has the company been moving to slow on some things  And what we want to make sure is that we can show it yet on the financial results that we are showing it externally that we re taking actions that we are moving with a high level of urgency in all these activities  So next quarter you re going to see    hear more about the actions we re taking  I think we will see some benefits on costs and on revenue  but the bulk of that will come in the second half of the year Mike Sison    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGot it  And then in order to get to that mid 20s type of EBITDA margin for the total company  is getting there primarily from your own actions or do you need a little bit of growth and sort of organic growth to get there Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI d like to target through our self help actions  but obviously organic growth is the bigger driver  What I don t want to use is organic growth as a reason not to do things  I think right now it s really about our self help actions and moving with urgency  I don t    I don t think it s healthy for the organization given our history to six months  eight months from now  a year from now to be talking about this again  Let s get it behind us  let s move forward  it s not going to be easy  but it s something we need to do  And then we can focus on more of the positive story moving forward  So self help is at the top of our list of drivers for our performance Mike Sison    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies  your line is open Kevin Estok    Jefferies    AnalystHi  good morning  This is Kevin Estok on for Laurence Alexander Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Kevin Kevin Estok    Jefferies    AnalystMy first question  Thanks  So my first question as to do with the end markets  So you mentioned that there would likely be inflection likely coming into the second half of 2020 and I was just curious to know if you ve already seeing some of those inflections happen and if so  which specific end market Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think this is sort of our seasonal low  If you look at it  this is a normal type of the year  but we are seeing already indications  If you look at  as I said Pharma had a tough comp  but there was a lot of actions in Q1 from customers around inventory  things that they did and we re starting to see the pickup of that  We saw few in Personal Care  few customers delayed orders just because  as an example in the sun care area  it was a softer year for our customers last year  so there was some inventory impact  but we re seeing those orders already coming in now  And for Coatings  I think the indication is more for us seasonally  it s more the back half for the year and indications is that that will start picking up  Architectural coatings are the big    the big driver for us and that s more of a seasonal  a seasonal driver J  Kevin Willis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe also saw some nice momentum in oral care  set the business losses aside  that we re still working through  We had some new product introduction there that drove some top line and bottom line growth for that business Kevin Estok    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  great  thanks  That was very helpful  And I guess my second question has to do with your restructuring effort that you ve talked a bit about  I m just curious to know I guess relationship between just realigning the different segments versus cost cutting and rightsizing  I guess should most of the cost cutting be done in 2020 and then sort of realigning kind of    are still working    work in progress Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo we are already realigning the businesses  I think the essence    once we define these businesses as we ve laid out to you  we are building the P Ls each leader now is looking at it  and there is no surprise  We have a very diverse portfolio of businesses  They re all nice healthy  but they re not all the same  Some are much healthier much nicer than others in terms of margins potentials  but the cost structures are also very different  So you might have some that have very high gross profit margins  but higher R D costs  others that are good gross profit  but not as high and lower R D more productivity driven  So each business now needs to align their structure to the P Ls In the past a lot of these support costs have been and we try to align them  but they ve been much more across the company  everybody gets their charge  we are now enabling the businesses to say  hey  I don t need that service  I don t    that s not important  I want to reduce it or increase it  In some of the cases  they might want more services in certain areas  We re going to give them that freedom  but we would like you to get most of that done this year  I think on the business side  these are not things that we need to delay  This is about structure  this is about how we focus  I think the structural side that take time are some of the more systems process related activities and that s probably more on the corporate    corporate side Kevin Estok    Jefferies    AnalystFigured  Thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS  your line is open John Roberts    UBS    AnalystThank you  First a manufacturing question  then I ve an R D question  But will the Industrial segment manufacture cellulosics for the consumer segments so that most of the manufacturing assets are going to end up over in industrial  And you chose not to merge the BDO or Intermediate   Solvents business into Industrial  I guess you could have done that  it s kind of small  but maybe talk about how the manufacturing is going to work in the new organization Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Yeah  so we are aligning who are    we look at who are the big volume drivers of the assets and who are the best owners in terms of taking the full P L and management accountability  So of the assets  it s going to vary by business  The cellulosics  in general tend to will be falling into the Specialty Additives business  they are the bigger volume and they need to really make sure that we re running the assets that if there is capacity that they are the ones that need to fill it out  The other  Pharma  Personal Care  you can t sell out those assets  I mean those are specialty very niche products  and it s really more about innovation and getting into customer formulation  So they re going to own that In the  Indecipherable   it s going to be more on the consumer side  they are the bigger driver on that  And then each one has their own assets  Adhesives  as an example is a big driver of lot of our acrylics  lot of our polyurethanes  but as Specialty Additives expand their portfolio of new Realogy modifiers  new products    there is going to be that interrelationship  I ve been    if you look at companies and business that I ve been involved in the past business running coatings in prior company  we ran the network it s very efficient  you have one owner  you can make sure that you re running things very efficiently  The part that you need to work with your other businesses and make sure that demand planning is robust and that there is a good dialog of understanding their needs so that we can service them appropriately John Roberts    UBS    AnalystAnd then R D as a percent of sales  just under 3  for all of the company  Do you have in mind a target for the Consumer Specialty segment Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean each one of them are going to now drive their agenda  So I don t want to speak for them  This is about empowering them to own this  So I don t want to put boundaries on what they re going to do  but clearly we have different businesses and they re going to spend differently and it s not just the dollar spend  The questions that we re asking them is where are you investing your money  When we look at our portfolio  we re looking at new product development  which are some really big new platforms that we re investing in  what are you investing in process technology productivity  So some businesses should be investing more on productivity as an examples  other should be more on new products because they have a robust portfolio  Others  hey  we should be looking at some of these longer term initiatives and developing new platforms  In the Consumer segment  a great example is biodegradable  that s one area that we are making a lot of progress  but we need to do    we d like to do more  One area that we ve done very  very well and now we re trying to get more products out the door is the biofunctional  that part of our business has been very good  So not one size fits all and each business will drive their agenda John Roberts    UBS    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J P  Morgan  your line is open Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    AnalystThanks very much  Earlier in the call   Indecipherable   you spoke of there being structural issues at Pharmachem  what s sort of structural issue  And how did it arise Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  you know  I think it s clear to say that you know we have been    we ve lost some important pieces of business and it s not across the board  If you look at the core  the three buckets of activities within Pharmachem  One of them of Avoca  we ve moved to Household  We ve had issues there  but that technology    actually they have a robust roadmap of things that they can do taking that technology in other areas and they re working it  So working with them to make sure that we are able to leverage that extraction and purification technologies that we have in that area is a good thing  but it is a change  So that s a structural change that they re doing In the Active Ingredients  I think that part is OK  its margins could be higher  that we need to improve  we re bringing in some new products  but how do we leverage that in our food additives business in a more    more systematic way we need to restructure how we do things  Part that is structural is the custom manufacturing type activities that we had at Pharmachem that has been hit  That s where most of the assets are  it s a more of a US based business and we need to address that  So Pharmachem  to be very direct  relative to our expectations how it s turned out has been very different and we need to address that in a more specific way  So I need a little bit more time to work with the team on that Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    AnalystWhere Pharmachem volumes down 20  in the quarter J  Kevin Willis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerActually  more than that  The volumes were significant gap for us in terms of the overall company  If you take out Pharmachem  I think you would see rest of the businesses have been pretty stable  And you wouldn t really    we wouldn t have been having a lot of these conversations in terms of the overall performance at this point in time Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    AnalystSo the other businesses inside of Specialty Ingredients where may be flat to down and the large decrement in revenues really came out of Pharmachem Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo yeah  if you look at Specialty Additives and talking in terms of some of the businesses the way we are going to talk about in future  Coatings was definitely a slightly down just in market demand  but we    it s a business that we have very strong positions in  I think the part that probably we didn t spike out as much is we had Nanjing that we talked about at last call that did have some costs in    not too much revenue  but cost in the quarter  And then last year we did close down a CMC plant in China that impacted revenue  but not so much profit  So if you combine the two  it looks like the business is down  but it s two different things  So I would say Coatings is much more market driven at this point in time  If you look at some of the big customers here that have merged  some of their activities just seasonality around the world with weather and things like that  So we re    I m not that concerned on that part of the portfolio Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd then lastly  does the Corona virus make any difference to your business  Does it affect  I don t know suppliers of raw materials or does it affect demand  Can you see any alteration in your business patterns in any way from the onset of the virus Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think you look at it in several different areas  One is our business in China and like everybody else  I mean if demand gets impacted and obviously is an issue  obviously now just movement of people and things is impacting operations  We don t really export a lot from there  So I don t expect that s going to be a big issue  but we re monitoring our customers  I mean at the end of the day  I think this is much more of a macro market issue  very different from other industries that are    have structural issues around supply or customer base there  For us that s not so much the case Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you so much Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson  your line is open Jim Sheehan    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThank you  Could you please give us a sense for the special ingredients organic growth rate excluding Pharmachem  I said    I think you just said it was relatively stable  but excluding the Pharmachem business loss  was your growth rate    the organic growth rate better or worse in this quarter relative to the prior quarter Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe were down versus the prior quarter  If you remember the    we had the Oral Care was an issue and then just general demand pharma as an example  we were down but it s really the comp that was a very tough one  On the other ones  I would say a few percentage  a percent or two and it s more macro driven than anything else Jim Sheehan    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystOkay  And could you please quantify the proportion of EBITDA that represents the more challenge structural portion of Pharmachem or any other way to estimate the proportion of that business that you think needs attention Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI guess we ll outline that as we roll out the new businesses and finance  but I would say it s not an insignificant amount to be very direct  I think if you look our Avoca business was sizable  So some of the impacts have been significant  I think toward the back end of the year  some of these new developments will come in and offset  so that s good news  On the nutrition side of a Pharmachem  that s going to take a little bit more time    time at work  but it s    it s not an insignificant amount of revenue or EBITDA Jim Sheehan    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThank you very much OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities  your line is open Mike Harrison    Seaport Global    AnalystHi  good morning Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Mike Mike Harrison    Seaport Global    AnalystGuillermo you made a comment that the organization was somewhat fatigued with change and obviously there s been a lot of change from a portfolio standpoint  I think maybe some change as well as at the management level or strategic standpoint  but can you give a little bit more detail on how that s factoring into your approach to the restructuring and reorganization  How do you    how do you overcome that fatigue and turn it into an organization that s more synergized about the path forward Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the first action that we re taking is focusing on the business  And I use the example of in airplanes when there is an emergency  the air mask comes down and they say put it on first and then help others  in our case  put it on the business and they will help us  So energizing our strength  which is really strong business capabilities and enabling that has to be at the forefront of what we do and how we re going to move forward in terms of driving performance  And that also generates excitement because that s where innovation  that s where engagement with customers  So making that much more visible and enriching because I think as people get the freedom to take action  they are the ones that are going to drive the actions  We re not going to do a top down realignment of businesses  it s the business teams  their leadership groups are really going to define where we go  That s difficult work  but it is also very energizing because they are able to see where they want to go  They are able to see why they re doing things in a much more clear line of sight way and that generates excitement and clarity  The majority    the reality is the majority of our organization things aren t going to change  It s really more to the better not to the cost reduction side I think on the other parts is  we re just going to be very honest and direct on what we need to do and that s not easy  not a the thing that people want to do and wake up in the morning  but it s something that we need to do for the better good of the company and the future and we re just going to be honest and direct about it and make sure that we are treating everybody in a fairway The other part is that this is not about just cutting costs on people  it s about driving simplicity and right sizing to a company or size  The hardest part when you are moving from  8 billion company to  5 billion to  3 billion is that you re not starting with a blank piece of paper  you re sort of evolving  what you have and that is very difficult  emotionally more hard  I think what we want to try to do is where are we today  what do we need and start with that blank piece of paper and then connect it to  But I need to have these discussions internally with our teams  I don t think it would be appropriate to go into details with the external world without giving the benefit of the discussion and communications internally  So we need a little bit more time to really give more details on that area Mike Harrison    Seaport Global    AnalystNo  Understood  that s good    that s good color  And then my other question is on the Coatings business you mentioned down modestly  and it sounds like that was related more to market weakness  Just wanted to get your sense if there is any inventory destocking that happened during the quarter still is yet to come  Do you feel like there has been any de formulation or any other share movements going on just as we head into the seasonal period of potentially rebuilding inventories  I think a lot of the coatings guys are going to talk about relatively easy comps related to weather  And so I just wanted to get a sense of how you re viewing your position in that market heading into the spring season  Thanks Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe re very well positioned  I mean if you look at  especially the Realogy s side  but also the other additives  but in Realogy clearly Ashland is    has a strong position in cellulosic  Aquaflow also extremely well positioned for some of the higher end paints and they re doing more  I think this is an area that we have    I think I mentioned last call our capabilities are higher than the portfolio we have  We can do more and that s what the team is doing  trying to expand the number of products that we have to bring to the market  So as the market improves  we should see this business do very well Mike Harrison    Seaport Global    AnalystThanks very much Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  And at this time I m not showing any further questions Guillermo Novo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  well thank you all for your interest  I m really looking forward to seeing all of you in the coming weeks and I thank you all for your support  And again to everybody from Ashland team that s listening  thank you for all your help  So looking forward to seeing you Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration

123633,345148,ASH,3 Chemical Stocks To Enrich Your Portfolio Before Q4 Earnings,opinion,The trade tussle between the United Sates and China weighed heavily on industries in the basic materials space last year  with the chemical industry being no exception  The damaging effects of the trade war between the world s two biggest economies were evident from the chemical industry s lackluster performance in 2018 The Zacks  industry  which consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals  plastics  specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals  significantly underperformed the broader market in 2018  The industry tumbled 26 3  compared with the Zacks S P 500 Composite s 6 1  decline  Investors  confidence on the chemical industry s prospects has taken a beating due the trade conflict  The Trump administration slapped punitive tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese products last year while China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on  110 billion in U S  goods  China s tariffs on American products include a wide range of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals and thus  leaves the American chemical industry heavily exposed to Beijing s retaliatory trade actions  The tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in this major market Trade tensions have clouded the overall demand outlook for chemicals  Softer demand from the automotive space of late is a concern for chemical makers  Notably  the trade friction has led to a slowdown in demand in China in this major chemical end use market What s Next for the Industry While trade tensions pose a risk  the chemical industry is poised for an upswing in 2019  In particular  the U S  chemical industry is set for a smooth run this year on the back of strength across major end use markets  higher industrial activities and gains in business investment The outlook for the American chemical industry paints an encouraging picture  The American Chemistry Council   ACC    a leading industry trade group  expects national chemical production  excluding pharmaceuticals  to rise 3 6  in 2019  The growth is expected to be spurred by gains in manufacturing and export and sustained demand across light vehicles and housing markets Meanwhile  the European Chemical Industry Council   CEFIC   envisions the European chemical industry to recover in 2019 from a decline in demand from the automotive industry in 2018  The CEFIC expects chemical output in the European Union to rise 0 5  year over year in 2019  which would mark a rebound from a 0 5  decline 2018  While the CEFIC sees demand from automotive  agricultural and construction sectors to improve modestly in 2019  it expects trade tensions between the United States  China and Europe to impact the industry s performance Expectations for Q4Per the Zacks Industry classification  the chemical industry is under the broader  sector  Earnings growth for the Basic Materials sector in the third quarter was second only to the energy sector  Overall earnings for the sector climbed 42  while revenues spiked 16 5  However  the Basic Materials sector is expected to lose momentum in the fourth quarter as earnings for the sector are projected to rise 2 9  on 4 8  higher revenues  per the latest  Chemical companies are expected to face some seasonal slowdown in demand in the December quarter  Chemical makers also face headwinds from a spike in costs of raw materials as a result of short supply partly due to production outages and plant shutdowns  China s environmental crackdown has led to the tightening in the supply of certain key raw materials as a result of plant closures  The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up the prices of these inputs in a high demand environment  Some of the chemical companies are also exposed to challenges from elevated energy and logistics costs Nevertheless  the companies should be able to offset the concerns with strategic measures  including cost cutting and productivity improvement and actions to raise selling prices  A number of companies including Eastman Chemical Company   NYSE EMN    Celanese Corporation   NYSE CE   and Ashland Global Holdings Inc    NYSE ASH   are taking aggressive price increase actions in the wake of raw material cost inflation  These actions should spur margin improvement in the fourth quarter Moreover  chemical companies remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and drive growth  Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings in the fourth quarter  President Donald Trump s business friendly tax reform also contributed to the performance of U S  chemical makers in the third quarter and would continue to act as a tailwind in the fourth Picking the Winning StocksCompanies in the chemical space face headwinds from raw materials cost inflation and demand weakness  Nevertheless  strategic measures including productivity improvement and price hike actions are likely to drive the performance of chemical makers in the fourth quarter As such  a sneak peek at the space for some potential winners backed by a solid Zacks Rank could be a great idea for investors looking to gain from the fourth quarter earnings season With the help of the   we have shortlisted chemical stocks that have an estimated year over year

123673,345188,ASH,US Specialty Chemicals Volumes Up In October  3 Stocks To Buy,opinion,The U S  specialty chemical industry started the fourth quarter on a positive note with October seeing a rise in volumes  according to the latest report from the American Chemistry Council   ACC   Positive October ReadingsThe Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group said yesterday that U S  specialty chemicals market volumes rose 0 3  in October on a monthly comparison basis  This follows a 0 4  gain a month ago and a 0 6  increase in August  The data changes are reported on a three month moving average basis Of the 28 specialty chemical segments monitored by the ACC  17 saw growth in October  During the reported month  large market volume growth  1  and over  was witnessed across foundry chemicals  lubricant additives and textile specialties Per the ACC  the overall specialty chemicals volume index went up 6 1  on a year over year basis in October  Volumes were driven by year over year growth in 22 markets and functional specialty chemical segments  Oilfield chemicals notched up the strongest growth with volumes climbing 16 6   The index stood at 114 4  of its average 2012 levels in October  which is equivalent to 3 54 million metric tons Trade Tensions Cloud ProspectsSpecialty chemical products are used based on their performance and have a specific purpose  They have application in the manufacturing process of a vast range of products including paints and coatings  cosmetics  petroleum products  inks and plastics The ACC envisions national chemical production  excluding pharmaceuticals  to rise 3 4  in 2018 and further gain steam with a 3 6  growth in 2019  The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets  an upswing in U S  manufacturing  favorable shale gas economics  capital investments and strengthening export markets  The trade group expects improving industrial activities to contribute to the growth of the specialty chemicals segment However  the prospects of the industry of late are being clouded by escalating trade tensions between the United States and China  The Trump administration imposed tariffs on  50 billion in Chinese goods earlier this year that led to China retaliating with tariffs on American products of equal value  The U S  administration  in September  also slapped a 10  tariff  slated to rise to 25  starting 2019  on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  thereby intensifying the trade tensions  In response  China hit back with tariffs on an additional  60 billion in American products Beijing s list of U S  goods hit with tariffs includes a wide range of chemicals  China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals and thus  leaves the U S  chemical industry heavily exposed to Beijing s retaliatory trade actions  The tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in this major market Strategic Actions to Reap Margin BenefitsCompanies in the specialty chemical space are also hamstrung by feedstock cost pressure  These companies face headwinds from a spike in costs of raw materials as a result of short supply partly due to production outages and plant shutdowns  China s environmental crackdown has led to the tightening in the supply of certain key raw materials as a result of plant closures  The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up the prices of inputs However  the companies in this space are gaining from favorable demand in major end use markets such as construction  electronics  automotive and agriculture as well as strategic measures including cost cutting and productivity improvement  expansion into high growth markets  operational efficiency improvement and earnings accretive acquisitions Moreover  a number of companies including Ashland Global Holdings Inc    NYSE ASH   and W  R  Grace   Co    NYSE GRA   are taking aggressive price increase actions in the wake of raw material cost inflation  These actions should help them alleviate any pressure on margin Stocks Worth a BetSpecialty chemical companies are bearing the brunt of trade tariffs and faces input cost pressure  However  strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions and continued focus on cost and productivity should keep them afloat over the short haul  The favorable October volume data also augurs well for the specialty chemical industry We highlight the following three specialty chemical stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  that are worth considering for investment in the prevailing operating environment  You can see  Ashland Global Holdings Inc  Kentucky based Ashland sports a Zacks Rank  1  It has expected earnings growth of 13 7

123693,345208,ASH,Is Ashland Global A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Ashland Global Holdings Inc    NYSE ASH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ashland Global has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Ashland Global s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Ashland Global has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 20 1  which is higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ashland Global has a P S ratio of about 0 8  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ASH is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ashland Global currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Ashland Global a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Ashland Global might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives ASH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 9 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Asahi Kasei Corp  Price and Consensus     The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for an in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAshland Global is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 35  of more than 250 industries  boosts investor confidence  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2017-10-10,Zacks Investment

123737,345252,ASH,Ashland Global  Should Value Investors Consider ASH Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Ashland Global Holdings Inc    NYSE ASH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ashland Global has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 57  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Ashland Global s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Chemical   Specialty industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 64  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Ashland Global has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 56  so it is fair to say that a less value oriented path may be ahead for Ashland Global stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ashland Global has a P S ratio of about 0 84  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 16 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ASH is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ashland Global currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Ashland Global a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Ashland Global is just 1 56  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 15  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 14  which is far better than the industry average of 13 52  Clearly  ASH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Ashland Global might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives ASH a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen four up and none down in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 11 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has moved lower by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Ashland Global Holdings Inc  Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAshland Global is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite its strong industry rank  among the top 32    its Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard for us to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Chemical   Specialty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Sell These Stocks  Now Just released  today s 220 Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention  If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List  they should be removed immediately  These sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments  However  from 1988 through 2016  stocks from our Strong Sell list have actually performed 6X worse than the S P 500

123749,345264,ASH,Ashland Resumes Operations In Texas City And Germany Plants,opinion,Ashland Global Holdings Inc    NYSE ASH   announced that operations at its manufacturing facilities in Texas City  TX  and Marl  Germany  have resumed to normal  The facilities were shut down last month due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey in south Texas and an earlier announced fire outbreak at the Marl plant Update on Texas City PlantThe Texas City manufacturing facility  which makes PVP crosslinked and linear homopolymers  NMP and PVP VA copolymers  recommenced full production last week  Adversely affected by the hurricane  this plant was shut down for nearly three weeks   According to Ashland  local workforce and an additional team of experts followed a comprehensive recovery plan to ensure that all plant equipment remained safe and in proper working condition before restarting operations  The company noted that rail services to this facility have resumed and shipping operations are also back in full swing at the warehouse near the plant Ashland has witnessed remarkable improvements in the broader trucking  shipping and rail networks  However  there are some congestion issues and capacity bottlenecks for bulk trucks  as plants in the area have restarted and are working through pent up demand  Further  domestic shipping  particularly for packaged goods  is improving  Although the Port of Houston has re opened  the company expects some delays in shipments Based on the latest information  Ashland believes the above discussed event is unlikely to have any substantial impact on its adjusted results for the September quarter   Update on Marl FacilityThe manufacturing plant at Marl  Germany  which produces tetrahydrofuran  THF   1 4 butanediol  BDO  and formaldehyde  has been restarted ahead of schedule  In August  the company had announced a force majeure in Europe  following a fire outbreak that led to the plant s shutdown The incident has restricted supply of the aforementioned products in Europe in the short term as the company return to normal operations and rebuilds inventory  Ashland is working closely with customers who have been affected by this incident and is trying to lessen the impact to their respective businesses during the shutdown According to Ashland  faster than expected return to production has enabled the company to reduce its expected financial impact of fire and consequent shutdown by around  5 million  to an estimated impact of  10  15 million  The company reaffirmed that there will be no impact on its adjusted results  given the unusual nature of the loss  It plans to include majority of the impact from the fire under key items in the financial statement when it releases earnings for the September quarter However  the adjusted results of its Intermediates and Solvents  I S  segment will reflect the profitability lost associated with sales lost due to the incident  The company expects adjusted EBITDA of the I S segment to be in the range of  5  10 million in fourth quarter fiscal 2017 Price PerformanceShares of Ashland have declined 3 4  in the last three months  underperforming the 0 7  loss incurred by the   Pharmachem Buyout to Drive Sales   MarginsAshland  during third quarter fiscal 2017  ended Jun 30   witnessed a 7  year over year increase in revenues of the Specialty Ingredients unit while sales of Composites were up 20  on the back of disciplined pricing and robust volume expansion in various global end markets  The I S unit also witnessed 9  growth in sales backed by the continued recovery in butanediol pricing and improving global demand In May 2017  Ashland closed the acquisition of Pharmachem Laboratories  Inc    a leading provider of quality ingredients to wellness and health industries  and high value differentiated products  including flavor and fragrance houses  The acquisition was a key contributor to Ashland s sales in the fiscal third quarter  The company anticipates to achieve meaningful cost synergies from leveraging combined capabilities  along with tax synergies resulting from the Pharmachem integration Pharmachem added 2 cents per share to Ashland s adjusted earnings in the fiscal third quarter  The company expects the acquisition to contribute 3 4 cents per share to its earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter Ashland Global Holdings Inc  Price and

123776,345291,ASH,5 Trade Ideas For Tuesday  ASH  BIIB  CCI  MNST  NSC,opinion,"5 Trade ideas excerpted from the detailed analysis and plan for premium subscribers 
Ashland Inc  NYSE ASH 
Ashland  ASH  rose from a low in February to a peak in July  It pulled back from there and made another higher top in September before starting a move lower through its 200 day SMA  That found a bottom in November and bounced  The price then started to bounce and making a higher high before falling back again  Coming into the week the bottom may be in again as it printed a strong candle Friday  The RSI is turning back up but with the MACD falling  Look for a continuation Tuesday to participate to the upside   
Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB 
Biogen  BIIB  broke up out of a falling channel in November and settled into a plateau  But it quickly fell out of that and started a new falling channel  leaving an Island Top behind  But Friday saw a strong move higher to the top of that channel  The RSI is turning up and the MACD about to cross up  Look for a push over the top of the channel to participate in the upside   
Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI 
Crown Castle  CCI  moved higher starting in March and accelerating in June to a climax high  It pulled back from there  in a tight channel at first to the 50 day SMA  Then in a more choppy fashion to a low at in November  A small bounce and retest of the low followed before a move up  establishing a double bottom  Now it is at resistance with a RSI holding just under the bullish zone and a MACD rising  Look for a push higher to participate   
Monster Beverage  NASDAQ MNST 
Monster Beverage  MNST  fell from a top in August in 2 steps  finding support in November almost 25  lower  The stock bounced from there and rose to the gap area on the second down leg before falling back  This was to a higher low and then it reversed back up again  Now it is at the resistance level again  The RSI is rising and on the edge of a move into the bullish zone while the MACD is rising and bullish   
Norfolk Southern  NYSE NSC 
Norfolk Southern  NSC  had a great 10 month run in 2016  coming into the week up 60  from the February low  After the election it moved higher rapidly for a 2 weeks and has settled and slowed since  Last week saw a resumption of the move higher  The RSI is bullish and rising after working off an overbought signal  while the MACD is stopping its fall  Look for continued upside to participate higher   
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the holiday shortened last week of the year sees the equity markets looking strong longer term and consolidative in the short term 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US Dollar Index is strong and looks to move higher while US Treasuries continue to be biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside with the Chinese market looking more like a digestive move rather than the breakdown in Emerging Markets 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and at very low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts all suggest further short term consolidation or even minor pullbacks may occur but within longer term strength  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as the markets head into the end of the second Quarter of the year  saw the equity markets remaining strong on both timeframes and poised for more upside 
Elsewhere look for Gold to participate to the upside while Crude Oil continues the trend lower  The US Dollar Index remains marking time in consolidation while US Treasuries continue higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both look to continue uptrends  although Emerging Markets may need some further consolidation first 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts look stronger on the weekly timeframe than the shorter one  And on that shorter timeframe the IWM and QQQ look set to outperform the SPY next week  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

123812,345327,ASH,Best And Worst ETFs And Mutual Funds  All Cap Value ,opinion,The all cap value style ranks sixth out of the twelve fund styles as detailed in my style roadmap  It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on an aggregation of the ratings of 2 ETFs and 285 mutual funds in the all cap value style as of July 18  2012  Figure 1 ranks from best to worst the two all cap value ETFs and Figure 2 shows the five best  and worst rated all cap value mutual funds  Not all all cap value style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 14 to 2039   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the all cap value style  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors seeking exposure to the all cap value style should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Only 2 All cap Value ETFs   Best ETFs exclude ETFs with less NAV s less than 100 million Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFigure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5   Best mutual funds exclude funds with NAV s less than 100 million Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFour mutual funds are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards iShares Russell 3000 Value  IWW  is my top rated all cap value ETF and FundVantage Trust  Formula Investing US Value Select Fund  FNSIX  is my top rated all cap value mutual fund  IWW earns my Neutral rating and FNSIX earns my Attractive rating First Trust Multi Cap Value AlphaDEX Fund  FAB  is my worst rated all cap value ETF and Trust for Professional Managers  Snow Capital Opportunity Fund  SNOAX  is my worst rated all cap value mutual fund  FAB earns my Neutral rating and SNOAX earns my Very Dangerous rating Figure 3 shows that 501 out of the 2198 stocks  over 35  of the total net assets  held by all cap value ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  neither of the two all cap value ETFs and 17 out of 285 all cap value mutual funds  less than 2  of total net assets  get an Attractive or better rating The takeaway is  all cap value mutual fund managers pick too many low quality stocks Figure 3  All cap Value Style Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering all cap value ETFs and mutual funds  as 98  of the total net assets invested in all cap value mutual funds is allocated to Neutral or Dangerous funds  No ETFs and only 17 mutual funds in the all cap value style allocate enough value to Attractive or better rated stocks to earn an Attractive rating  Accenture PLC  ACN  is one of my favorite stocks held by all cap value ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating  Accenture is a steady value creator  Since 2007  ROIC has been consistently in the 40 50  range  placing Accenture among the elite when it comes to the efficiency and profitability of their business model  Accenture is well known as an industry leader by boosting efficiency and creating value for their clients  Their operating results indicate that they are doing the same thing for their own shareholders  A consistently profitable business like Accenture is a great stock to pick up when Mr  Market serves up an attractive price  and that is certainly the case right now  ACN s current share price    58 60  implies that the company s after tax profits  NOPAT  will decline by 10  permanently  Those pessimistic expectations give ACN an attractive risk reward profile  Ashland Inc   ASH  is one of my least favorite stocks held by all cap value ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Dangerous rating  Ashland operates in cyclical industries  which means that when sales are growing  they need to be poised to capitalize  because there are sure to be tough years ahead  Results through the second quarter of ASH s 2012 fiscal year have provided some hopeful revenue growth  but the company has failed to deliver solid returns  Here s why  over the past several years ASH s ROIC has stair stepped downward from 5  in 2007 to a measly 1 4  last year  ASH s bulging balance sheet has failed to deliver new profits  Furthermore  their pre tax operating margins have languished  averaging around 4  over the same period  It s crucial for cyclical companies like ASH to be efficient so that they can strike in the fat years and weather the lean ones  ASH has been on a steady decline in capital efficiency and operating margins  so it s tough to see why the market has such high expectations  To justify its current stock price    69 60   ASH would need to grow its profits 20  compounded annually for the next 15 years  High expectations and stagnant operating efficiency drive ASH s Very Dangerous rating  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all all cap value ETFs and mutual funds  Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst Funds Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Figure 5  Separating the Best Mutual Funds From the Worst Funds Sources  New

Stocks Entering Period of Seasonal Strength Today 



Ashland Inc   NYSE ASH  Seasonal Chart

 The Markets 
Stocks traded higher on Monday  yet again pushing the S P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average to new closing highs  Despite significantly overbought conditions  the S P 500 Index charted the 27th straight session above its 5 day moving average  setting a record for the longest run above this short term average in the past 60 years The 5 day average  which continues to support the short term trend of the large cap benchmark  currently sits at 2057 24  According to the Relative Strength Index  the S P 500 Index is now the most overbought since September 14 of 2012  leaving the benchmark vulnerable to a retracement given the upside exhaustion  Short term seasonal tendencies for the equity market remain positive through the remainder of this holiday week before softening into early December when tax loss selling pressures are typical 



A couple of key benchmarks in the US are testing long term resistance  The Russell 2000 Small Cap index is bumping up against resistance just above 1180  while the NYSE Composite is testing resistance around 11 100  These benchmarks remain some of the few holdouts amongst the slew of new 52 week highs charted over the last couple of weeks  Seasonally  both benchmarks tend to outperform the S P 500 index between now and the end of the year  implying that if a breakout is recorded  investors may rotate towards these indices that have greater exposure to small cap stocks  A word of caution  however  Small caps have meandered around the flatline for much of the year  making them vulnerable to tax loss selling pressures at the start of December  as of November 20th  the Russell 2000 was up a mere 0 61  on the year   Since 1987  when the Russell 2000 Index has recorded a year to date return of 5  or less by November 20th  the small cap benchmark has recorded a loss each year during the tax loss selling period that runs between December 5th and December 15th  declines over this short term negative period average 1 72     Tax loss selling pressures typically lead to ideal buying opportunities in small cap stocks for the dominant period of strength that runs through the last two weeks of the year 








Meanwhile  north of the border  Canadian banks begin to report earnings next week  reaction to which will be widely watched as they encompass a significant portion of Canadian portfolios  Two Canadian banking financial ETFs are approaching resistance at the September high  The BMO S P TSX Equal Weight Bank ETF  TO ZEB  is bumping up against the high of  24 72  while the iShares S P TSX Capped Financials Index Fund  TO XFN  is testing the high of  32 64  momentum indicators for both are showing signs of rolling over as price action stalls ahead of the earnings result  Reaction to the numbers will either confirm the level of resistance  sending the Canadian financial sector back lower  or fuel a breakout  resuming the long term trend that has remained intact since 2012  Seasonal tendencies for the Canadian Financial sector remain positive through the end of the year  although volatility surrounding the numbers is typical 





Sentiment on Monday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 79

123819,345334,ASH,This Week s Top Trade Ideas  ASH  BMRN  COF  FITB  TYC,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Ashland Inc  N ASH 
Ashland  ASH  has been in a downtrend since the beginning of December  That morphed into consolidation at the end of January as it bounced along under resistance  With the bottom in mid February it is back at resistance coming into the week  Momentum is building as the RSI is rising and near the bullish zone while the MACD is rising  Watch for a push through resistance to participate in a new leg higher 
Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc  O BMRN 
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals  BMRN  has been trending lower since July in a series of steps  The recent bounce though is making it attractive to look at for a short term  at least  reversal higher  Consolidating the move with a rising RSI and MACD it has momentum on its side to continue through the consolidation higher  Look to participate if it does 
Capital One Financial Corporation  N COF 
Capital One  COF  fell on volume in July but then consolidated for several months  In December it started lower again though  reaching a bottom in late January  It retested that bottom  for a double bottom  and is now finding resistance at the gap from the start of the year  The RSI is rising and near a turn into the bullish zone  with the MACD rising as well  These support more upside  Look for a push through resistance to participate higher 
Fifth Third Bancorp  O FITB 
Fifth Third  FITB  fell from consolidation to start the year  eventually losing over a third of its market cap in 6 weeks  It has bounced along since finding that bottom with resistance sitting just below 16  The RSI is rising and moving toward the bullish zone  while the MACD is bullish and rising  Look for a break of resistance to the upside to participate in the move 
Tyco International PLC  N TYC 
Tyco  TYC  started higher in July 2011  But that ended June 2014 when it started the recent down move  That found a bottom in late January and a strong bounce in a gap move higher  The price action since has been consolidation  until the price broke higher Friday  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is turning back up for a cross  both supporting more upside  Consider adding this stock as long as it holds that break out level 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with just a Leap Day left in February sees the Equity markets looking ready to spring higher 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue to consolidate in its uptrend while Crude Oil consolidates the recent move higher  The US Dollar Index also looks to continue to move sideways but with an upward bias short term while US Treasuries are showing signs of topping in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite seems ready for more downside  at least in the short term  while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside next week 
Volatility looks to continue the move lower towards normal levels easing the pressure for the equity index ETF s SPY  N SPY   IWM and QQQ  Their charts all look better to the upside in the short term  with very constructive movement higher out of the 2016 range for the SPY and IWM  The QQ lags behind but only just slightly  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
