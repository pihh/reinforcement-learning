3009,224524,CIDM,Cinedigm Stock  Gaining Big On Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Cinedigm Corp  NASDAQ CIDM 
Ciedigm is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  The company reported its earnings for the fourth quarter  beating expectations and exciting investors  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from the earnings report  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from CIDM moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
CIDM Reports Strong Earnings
As mentioned above  Cinedigm is having an incredibly strong trading session today  and for good reason  The company released its earnings report yesterday after the closing bell  along with key updates  Here s what we saw from the report 
Earnings   In terms of earnings CIDM did incredibly well  During the quarter  analysts expected that the company would report earnings in the amount of  1 05 per share  However  the company surprised investors by reporting a far narrower loss than expected  In the first quarter  the content distributor produced a loss of  0 95 per share   0 10 ahead of analyst expectations 
Revenue   While revenue wasn t quite as strong as earnings  CIDM definitely didn t disappoint either  During the quarter  the company generated revenue in the amount of  23 21 million  This figure came in right in line with analyst expectations 
Cost Savings   The year 2016 has been an incredibly important year for Cinedigm  That s because the company launched an initiative early this year with a goal of saving on costs  Along with earnings the company announced that these initiatives are going very successfully  In fact  they are expecting to achieve in excess of  10 million in cost savings this year 
Management Changes   Finally  CIDM made key announcements with regard to management  First and foremost  Ron Chez has been appointed as the new lead director of the company  He has served as a strategic advisor to the company for the past year  Also  effective immediately  the company s board of directors will be reduced from seven members to five members  It was announced that Blair Westlake and Martin O Connor have made the decision to resign from the board in order to achieve this reduction  In a statement with regard to management changes  CEO Chris McGurk had the following to offer 
 This streamlining will further improve board efficiency and I am confident the board is fully aligned with shareholder interest  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market  Any time positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the stock associated with the news  Adversely  when negative news is released  we can expect to see declines  In this particular case  the news that was released with regard o CIDM was overwhelmingly positive  As a result  the stock had a strong day in the market today  By the end of the trading session  the stock closed the day off at  1 59 per share after a gain of  0 69 per share or 77 06  
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from Cinedigm  The reality is that the loss being smaller is good news  However  that s not why investors are so happy  The excitement is coming from the fact that the company is doing incredibly well on its cost savings initiatives  On top of that  the management news was overwhelmingly positive  At the moment  it seems as though CIDM is on track for strong gains ahead ",2016-07-17,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cinedigm-(cidm)-stock:-gaining-big-on-q4-earnings-200142233,200142233
