list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL    Applied Materials Inc    NASDAQ AMAT    Synopsys Inc    NASDAQ SNPS    Copart Inc    NASDAQ CPRT   and State Street Corp    NYSE STT   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Ranked Stocks to Ride on the S P 500 Rally in 2020Wall Street bulls are raging since the beginning of this year  breaking one record after another  The S P 500 Index  generally considered as the barometer of market sentiment within the financial circle  reached a milestone on Jan 16 after closing  above the technical threshold of 3 300 for the first time S P 500 Firing on All CylindersThe S P 500 Index rallied 28 9  in 2019  which was a complete reversal of its pathetic performance in 2018 when it had plunged 6 2   The benchmark index s gain last year was the second highest  barring 29 6  gain in 2013  since 1997  when the index had jumped 31   In 2019  the index achieved a major milestone after closing above a key psychological barrier of 3 000 for the first time on Jul 12 The broad market index has maintained last year s momentum since the beginning of 2020  Year to date  it has gained nearly 2 7   On Jan 17  it ended above 3 300 for the first time  This means the S P 500 has rallied 10  in the past six months On Jan 17  the S P 500 closed at 3 316 81  well above its 50 day and 200 day moving averages of 3 172 23 and 2 991 99  respectively  In financial literature  the 50 day moving average line is generally recognized as the short term trend setter  while the 200 day moving average is considered as the long term trend setter It is widely believed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50 day moving average line surges ahead of the 200 day moving average line  a long term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility Will S P 500 s Bull Run Continue Several economists and financial researchers have projected that the S P 500 index is likely to gain 15 20  in 2020 even though this is the U S  presidential election year  Historically  the index provided 6 3  annual returns in presidential election years and was up 78  of the time  Meanwhile  trade deals  a stable U S  economy and a dovish Fed are near term catalysts for the benchmark index The recently signed interim trade deal between the United States and China will be a major relief to the year long tariff related conflict  The phase one trade deal is a major boost to the economies of the two largest trading nations of the world and lowers the likelihood of a global economic slowdown Moreover  on Jan 16  the U S  Senate overwhelmingly voted in favor of the U S  Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA   sending the pact to President Donald Trump for signature  The newly formed USMCA will replace the previous NAFTA for which Trump has several reservations Finally  an accommodative Fed  which reiterated its commitment to do whatever needed to support economic expansion  will be a major catalyst for future growth  The central bank has decided not to raise interest rate until the inflation rate  which is currently at just 1 6   crosses the Fed s target level of 2     Our Top Picks  At this stage  it will be prudent to invest in the

14516,236031,STT,Warren calls on big U S  banks for steps on climate risk,news,"By Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir SAN FRANCISCO WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren  a contender for the Democratic Party s presidential nomination  is asking the biggest U S  banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming   To protect themselves and the economy from climate driven catastrophes  large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks   Warren  a frequent critic of big banks  said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America  NYSE BAC   Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK    Citigroup   NYSE C   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   JP Morgan   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    State Street   NYSE STT  and  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC     I write to ask for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution s practices  including what steps  if any  your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks   she said in the letters  provided to Reuters   She asked for detailed written responses by Feb  7  Over the past year a surge in natural disasters caused or exacerbated by warming temperatures  including bushfires in Australia  have driven climate change up the political agenda around the world and sparked protests demanding action   The threat has caught the attention of financial regulators concerned with how rising seas and other consequences of the build up of human generated greenhouse gases could impact financial stability by  for instance  eroding the value of homes against which banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars   Regulators are also focused on assessing the potential impact of political responses to climate change on bank profitability and even viability  even as the world s largest banks are increasingly targeted by activists for providing funding to fossil fuel intensive industries  a major contributor to global warming   Led by the Bank of England  dozens of central banks have called for better disclosure of risks related to climate change and have begun mapping out approaches to banking sector supervision that take such risks into account  At its first ever conference on climate change and economics last November  the U S  Federal Reserve signaled it too may look at how to incorporate climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability  A panel convened by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has begun its own effort to examine climate threats to the financial system   But overall  U S  financial regulators lag their peers abroad   The current Republican U S  administration has played down research on the risks of global warming and rolled back regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions  STRESS TESTS On Tuesday  at the World Economic Forum in Davos where environmental issues have taken center stage  President Donald Trump dismissed those worried by climate change as  perennial prophets of doom    Warren is among a group of leading Democrats vying for the party s nomination to take on Trump in the November contest for U S  president  but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow U S  Senator Bernie Sanders in most opinion polls  All three are in favor of more government action to reduce U S  carbon dioxide emissions to limit impacts on the U S  economy  Warren last year was a co signer of a bill that would direct the Fed to  stress test  banks  resilience to climate related financial risks  In her letter  Warren asked the banks for details on how the proposed legislation would affect their operations as well as investments in oil companies  and whether they would support such a law   She also asked whether they formally assess climate related risks and what changes they may have made in response   As climate change continues to affect our economy  it is critical to understand your bank s adaptation and mitigation strategies   Warren wrote   Many large U S  banks  including those receiving Warren s letter  acknowledge that climate change poses a business risk and some make some disclosures about their own climate related risks in line with recommendations from the international Financial Stability Board   Reuters asked each bank for comment on Warren s letter after normal business hours   
A JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  spokesman said the bank was reviewing the letter  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman pointed to the environmental sustainability section of its website  which touts its financing of clean technology and environmental education  and a State Street spokesman  while declining comment  noted the bank s track record on the issue  which includes support for carbon pricing ",2020-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/warren-calls-on-big-us-banks-to-disclose-preparation-for-climate-risk-2064936,2064936

14518,236033,STT,5 Low Cost Tech ETFs For Investors,opinion,"The tech sector has been red hot in recent months thanks to its inherent strength  increased adoption of emerging technologies and the announcement as well as the signing of the U S  China phase one trade deal  Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund  was up 51 6  in the past year  gained 19  in the past six months and has advanced 4  this year 
Even escalation in U S  Iran tensions to start 2020 could not take a bite of the sector s rally as investors wagered big on tech companies that focus on threat detection services  Cloud computing and cybersecurity stocks  in fact  gained a lot on the Middle East crisis  read

Cloud computing and artificial intelligence will keep ruling the technology sector  with 2020 likely to be a breakout year for edge computing    The sector carries a Zacks Rank  2  The thesis makes it intriguing for continued bets on technology ETFs 
Why Low Expense Ratio Funds Are Better
While there are a number of factors that investors consider before investing in ETFs  cost is an important factor that drives their investment decision  In the long run  cheaper funds can handily outperform expensive ones  at least when other factors remain constant 
Consider an expense ratio of 1   a fund of  10 000 invested at 8  annual return will grow to  19 672 in 10 years  while the same fund invested at an expense ratio of 0 1  will grow by a higher amount of  21 390  The difference between the returns will keep zooming out  increasing the holding period 
Considering the same parameters  with an expense ratio of 0 1   a fund of  10 000 will grow to  97 869 in 30 years  at the same 8  rate of return   The same fund will however grow to a much lesser value of  76 123 with an expense ratio of 1  
The price war among issuers has intensified of late owing to rising competition  For a long period of time  the lowest cost corner was ruled by Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  and Vanguard  But now other players like State Street  NYSE STT  BlackRock  NYSE BLK  are resorting to fee cuts to grab market share 
Against such a backdrop  we have highlighted five tech ETFs with ultra low expense ratios that can be considered at the current operating backdrop

144648,366163,STT,US Bonds Roar Out Of The Gate In 2020,opinion,"The new year is not quite a month old but that hasn t stopped US bonds from piling up impressive returns  For the strongest corners of fixed income  it s fair to say that 2020 has been spectacular so far  based on a set of exchange traded funds 
Leading the field by a wide margin year to date  long Treasuries  The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  has surged 6 7  this month through yesterday s close  Jan  29   Long bond prices have been boosted by a renewed risk off appetite in recent weeks  in part due to global concerns over the spreading 
It doesn t hurt that the Federal Reserve yesterday signaled no plans to raise interest rates any time soon   Uncertainties about the outlook remain  including those posed by the new coronavirus   Powell explained at a news conference yesterday   There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and globally  from the virus 
TLT s rise this year is striking in absolute terms  but it s even more impressive on a relative basis  TLT s year to date gain is more than triple the 1 7  rise for the US investment grade benchmark via Vanguard Total Bond Market  BND   Adding to TLT s shine this year  the fund is also outperforming the US stock market by a hefty degree   US equities are currently up a relatively modest 1 5  year to date  based on SPDR S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY

Another factor that s driving bond prices higher is a revival in recession worries  Although there are no signs that a downturn is imminent  as    the Treasury market is inclined once more to price in a higher probability of weaker or negative growth  The 10 year 3 month spread  for instance  fell to 4 basis points yesterday  the lowest since October  An inverted yield curve  in other words  looks increasingly likely in the days ahead 






 The flattening of the curve is an indication that the growth concerns are greater now   says Marvin Loh  senior global macro strategist for  State Street   NYSE STT    Everything is just a bit more fragile  and we re all wondering what the next headline is around the coronavirus

Meantime  the Fed seems to be telling markets that it ll keep interest rates steady even if growth endures but if the economy weakens a new round of stimulus will unfold 
 While the Fed may want to portray its 2020 rate policy as stable  markets are signaling that their bias should be to further easing   wrote Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research in a research note on Wednesday

144653,366168,STT,BlackRock looks for middle ground on shareholder resolution reforms,news,"By Ross Kerber
NEW YORK  Reuters    BlackRock Inc  N BLK  has cited both the value and costs of shareholder proposals in a long awaited letter to regulators weighing reforms to the proxy process  effectively looking for a middle ground in a hotly contested area of U S  rulemaking 
The letter provided by a spokesman for the world s largest asset manager on Thursday was just one of thousands of backlogged comments to the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  that were due on Monday and still being posted to the agency s website 
But with some  7 4 trillion under management  BlackRock s views have been eagerly awaited both by corporations supportive of the rule changes to streamline their annual meetings  and investor activists worried the SEC will make it harder to bring attention to environmental  social and governance issues 
Both sides had hoped that BlackRock would support them ahead of an SEC vote as soon as March  especially in light of a new focus on climate issues outlined by BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink last month 
Instead  in the letter dated Feb  3  BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick did not specifically address controversial ideas the SEC advanced in a partisan vote in November  such as raising the current threshold of  2 000 worth of stock needed to file some resolutions 
 Shareholder proposals can be a valuable part of an investment stewardship process  however  it should be acknowledged that the costs of these proposals are borne by all shareholders   Novick wrote 
She also did not take a strong stand on related reforms the SEC is considering for proxy advisers  changes that have raised concerns from hedge funds 
BlackRock has previously declined to comment on its views in detail  and spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday 
Among other big passive fund managers  Vanguard Group has filed comments supportive of the SEC s changes  A  State Street  Corp  N STT  executive said in an interview last week the firm did not have a view on the matter  Some smaller active managers have criticized the reforms 
Richard Fields  a King   Spalding LLP attorney who represents corporations  said that in avoiding specifics in its SEC comments   BlackRock has chosen to stay squarely on the fence  
That could reflect the fact that BlackRock s clients will have a wide range of views on the shareholder proposals  he added  but  one might have assumed that Fink s January letter would herald a more assertive posture here  
Jon Hale  global head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar  said previously the new rules would undermine the process of engagement between shareholders and company managers on climate risk and other sustainability issues 
Asked about Novick s letter  Hale said by email   I think it would have been more to the point for BlackRock s letter to have said simply  Dear SEC  We don t have a clear position on either of these issues  Sincerely  BlackRock  ",2020-02-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-looks-for-middle-ground-on-shareholder-resolution-reforms-2078353,2078353

State Street s earnings story starts with revenue  which climbed about 1  over the previous year s quarter  This was buoyed by a 2  increase in fee revenue due to higher servicing and management from overall stock market gains and several major new business wins  The company scored  294 billion worth of investment servicing business in the quarter alone  bringing the total of new business for the year to  1 8 trillion    similar to the record year it had in 2018 for wins 
State Street saw strong growth in its new front to back investment management and servicing platform called Alpha platform  which it launched last year  It combines the middle  and back office servicing that State Street has traditionally provided with front office research  trading  and portfolio optimization capabilities on a single platform  
These wins offset losses in interest income due to three successive interest rate cuts in 2019  Net interest income  the difference between the revenue generated from a bank s interest bearing assets and expenses associated with paying out interest  declined 9  in the quarter  State Street also had net outflows of  3 billion from its investment management business  The outflows from institutional and cash funds were offset by  24 billion in net inflows into the firm s ETFs  Overall  net income improved 61  year over year to  704 billion  driven by an aggressive expense reduction plan 

Expense reduction
State Street managed to cut expenses by  219 million  or 9   compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  Most of it came from cuts to compensation and employee benefits  which decreased 12  year over year  For the year  the company reduced expenses by  415 million  reflecting several initiatives  including a 3  reduction in staff over the course of the year  There were also savings from automating certain functions and moving offices to less expensive locations  among other cuts  It was beyond initial projects of reducing expenses by  350 million  
The blueprint for 2020 is similar as expense reduction will continue  explained State Street President and CEO Ronald O Hanley on the fourth quarter earnings call  The plan is to cut expenses by another 1  with expense reductions targeted in IT  among other areas   We expect that our global reach and expertise in servicing and data analytics  combined with our unique front to back Alpha strategy  will enable us to realize our vision of becoming the leading asset servicer  asset manager  and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world s capital   O Hanley said 
The company also projects increased growth in its asset servicing business  particularly through its Alpha platform  which O Hanley said has a strong pipeline  While the market outlook is uncertain in 2020  State Street is a solid buy as it s in a good position to grow earnings through its diversified business mix  innovations  and balance sheet management ",2020-01-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pniff,2068659

144726,366241,STT,As U S  election heats up  investors brace for volatility,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  stock market that has weathered trade wars  weak corporate earnings  and now a U S  Iran conflict to continually hit record highs faces a new obstacle  the 2020 U S  election season 
Investors are bracing for more volatility as soon as early February when Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire kick off the primary season  Clues about which candidates will have momentum heading into next month will emerge on Tuesday  when the Democratic Party holds its next presidential debate 
Stocks could retreat if a progressive candidate scores a few early victories or if seemingly more market friendly moderates  such as former Vice President Joe Biden  fail to register much support 
The market may face political uncertainty for months if it takes a long time to select the Democratic candidate  who would then face a hard fought race against President Donald Trump before the November election 
 Investors could potentially sit on the sidelines waiting for more clarity around the election   said Michael Arone  chief investment strategist at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors in Boston 
 It wouldn t surprise me  especially coming off what has been a very solid year in markets  for investors to kind of take a wait and see approach   Arone added 
After gaining about 29  in 2019  the benchmark S P 500  SPX  has kept pushing higher  minting fresh record highs on Thursday  as U S  Iran tensions appeared to have abated for now 
Some investors still believe Wall Street is ripe for a pullback 
 The domestic calendar for the primary season is going to be a source of volatility   said Alicia Levine  chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management   I think the market will use it as an excuse to come in a little bit and take some heat out of the market and take some of the froth out of the market  depending on some of these outcomes  
Levine called the elections a  sleeper issue  because stocks are pricing in a market friendly outcome 
Investors said they are weighing scenarios that would be relatively favorable for stocks overall  These include Trump s reelection and victory by a seemingly moderate Democratic candidate such as Biden or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 
But stocks could fall if U S  senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren  who are seen as more likely to push for increased regulations in areas such as healthcare and technology  and for wealth taxes  outperform in the primaries 
 The more Joe Biden and other moderates are overtaken by the progressives  I think the market will very gradually begin to price in more headwinds   said Dave Lafferty  chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston 
Shares of healthcare companies were pressured last year by worries that Warren and Sanders would push through a government run Medicare for All  Those fears have eased  but healthcare is one sector likely to face the election spotlight this year  along with technology  financials and energy 
With no strong favorite currently  Trump s Democratic opponent may not be clear by March 3  when more than a dozen states vote on Super Tuesday 
 Uncertainty is never good for the stock market   said Matt Maley  chief market strategist at Miller Tabak  who added that following Super Tuesday   you usually know who the candidates are going to be and this time around there s a good chance that you won t  
Another factor is control of Congress  Trump s Republican party holds the Senate  while Democrats have a grip on the House of Representatives   split control that investors say is relatively market friendly

144747,366262,STT,Dollar bolstered by U S  jobs data  markets look to trade talks,news,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO  Reuters    The dollar held firm on Monday after data showed surprise strength in the U S  jobs market  but the currency was restrained from moving higher by worries about an escalation in the U S  China trade war 
The dollar index   USD  stood almost flat at 97 706 in mid Asian trade  after rising 0 3  on Friday  The euro traded at  1 10575  EUR    after hitting a one week low of  1 10395 on Friday 
The dollar changed hands at 108 58 yen   It had lifted to 108 92 yen on the U S  jobs data before losing momentum 
U S  nonfarm payrolls increased by 266 000 jobs last month  the biggest gain in 10 months  while the unemployment rate ticked back down to 3 5   its lowest level in nearly half a century 
Those figures suggested the Trump administration s 17 month trade war with China  which has plunged manufacturing into recession  has not yet spilled over to the broader U S  economy 
Still  investors think that could change if trade tensions escalate further  especially if Trump goes ahead with planned tariffs on some  156 billion worth of products from China from Dec  15 
The market has been largely working on the assumption that those tariffs  which cover several consumer products such as cellphones and toys  will be dropped or at least postponed  given that Washington and Beijing agreed in October to work on a trade deal 
 Markets are sensing that both sides want to avoid a collapse of their negotiation  judging from various news headlines   said Kazushige Kaida  chief of forex at  State Street   NYSE STT    So the main scenario is for the dollar yen to test mid 109 yen levels  
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow confirmed on Friday that the Dec  15 deadline to impose the new tariffs remains in place  but added that President Donald Trump likes where trade talks with China are going 
China s exports shrank for the fourth consecutive month in November  underscoring persistent pressures on manufacturers from the Sino U S  trade war 
Elsewhere  sterling traded at  1 3143   not far from a seven month high of  1 3166 set on Thursday 
Against the euro  the pound hit a 2 1 2 year high of 84 10 pence per euro  EURGBP D4  
The currency has been bolstered by expectations that Prime Minister Boris Johnson s Conservative Party will win an outright majority in the upcoming election on Thursday  thereby ending a hung parliament and political paralysis on Brexit 
The Conservative Party extended its lead over the Labour Party to 14 percentage points  up from 9 percentage points a week ago  an opinion poll by Survation for ITV s Good Morning Britain showed on Monday 
 Markets now think the Tories will win  But if they fail to win an outright majority  that means essentially nothing is different from now and will be a fairly big shock for the market   said Minori Uchida  chief FX analyst at MUFG Bank 






The Canadian dollar traded at C 1 3255 to the U S  unit   The loonie shed more than 0 5  on Friday following data showing the Canadian job market losing a surprise 71 200 net positions in November when economists had expected a gain of 10 000 ",2019-12-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/dollar-bolstered-by-us-jobs-data-markets-look-to-trade-talks-2036539,2036539
144748,366263,STT,Morgan Stanley Funds Step Away From Exceptionally Dull FX Market,news," Bloomberg     The unprecedented level of calm pervading global currencies is pushing investors to rethink their approach to the  6 6 trillion a day market 
 Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  Investment Management has pared its foreign exchange exposure  awaiting a clearer theme  Amid the trend less torpor  Russell Investments Ltd  is focusing on value  and is forsaking major currencies in favor of those from developing economies  For  State Street   NYSE STT  Global  that same approach leads to Scandinavia as the firm scours the Group of 10 for opportunities 
Turbulence picked up a hair this month in the run up to the Dec  15 deadline for additional U S  tariffs on China  as investors braced for the possibility of rocky times ahead  Events in the next few days could also jump start market swings  The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will deliver policy decisions  and the U K  holds a general election that could pave the way for Brexit  But for the time being  volatility remains near all time lows across some major currency pairs 
That s a boon for companies  which can hedge international revenue more cheaply than ever  if they so choose  But it s a problem for traders who rely on swings and trends to squeeze out a profit from FX  While the S P 500 is on pace to log its best annual performance since 2013  and Treasuries are headed for their biggest gain since 2011  currency focused funds are suffering a fourth straight year of losses 
 It s difficult to make money in these low vol environments   said Aaron Hurd  senior portfolio manager in the currency group at State Street Global   Nothing s firing on all cylinders  and that just breeds confusion and lack of conviction  
Currency turbulence has been declining in part because market expectations for central banks and the relative strength of major economies have largely been met  A JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  measure of global FX volatility is close to a five year low  while one month implied volatility sank to all time lows in the euro  Canadian dollar and New Zealand dollar late last month 
Low Conviction
Morgan Stanley Investment Management has decided to bide its time  The fund manager has reduced its currency exposure to 1  to 2   from typical levels of 5  to 7   according to portfolio manager Jim Caron  It s difficult to create a compelling trading narrative with most major currencies locked in such tight ranges  he said 
 We re not going to take just a punt on the currency   he said   It s hard for me to have high conviction and want to expose myself very greatly to something I believe is going to just kind of drift  as opposed to trend  
He anticipates that the catalyst to increase currency exposure back to normal levels would be if the U S  and China were to agree to a phase one trade deal  Chinese officials expect the U S  s planned Dec  15 tariff increase to be postponed  giving more time to negotiate an interim pact  according to people familiar with the matter 
Emerging Focus
The currency exposure that MSIM still has on is mostly weighted to Latin American  South American and some Asian currencies  Caron said  That s based on the view that growth in those emerging economies will draw capital  Most emerging market currencies have weakened versus the dollar in 2019 
 EM can perform reasonably well next year  and we think that it s going to to attract investment there   Caron said   That s going to come at the expense of the dollar  
The quest for value is a common theme among many investors facing an FX landscape devoid of lasting moves 
Russell  which manages about  5 billion in active currency    meaning FX as an asset class    has seen returns of about 5  since May in its emerging market value strategy  There s potential for more gains there  according to fixed income and currency research head Van Luu 
Scandinavia Calls
For Amundi Asset Management s Andreas Koenig  the volatility malaise makes value the dominant strategy in foreign exchange at the moment 
He s optimistic about the Norwegian and Swedish currencies in 2020 should the global economic outlook rebound from the headwinds of the trade war  The two currencies have both slumped more than 5  against the dollar in 2019  making them the worst performing G 10 currencies  For Norway s krone  the tumble has come even as the Norges Bank hiked rates 
Barring a marked global slowdown   currencies which were affected by these negative expectations of trade and growth and are undervalued should come back into interest   said Koenig  He s head of global currencies at Amundi  which oversees  1 7 trillion 
State Street Global s Hurd is also looking to Scandinavia  He said the krone is one of his largest bullish positions 
Hedging Opportunity
For Brad Bechtel at Jefferies  staying long the dollar has been a profitable way to navigate the tranquility in FX  given the appeal of still positive U S  yields 
And because American short term rates are higher than in most other developed markets  dollar based investors can benefit by entering short positions against low yielding currencies  he said 
However  he sees a risk that volatility may be poised to rebound amid trade negotiations  Brexit developments and discussions of fiscal stimulus in Germany  For him  buying three month euro yen volatility is the best way to position for that 
 Over a three month kind of time horizon  we would anticipate that at least a couple of opportunities are going to arise   he said   Euro yen vol is super cheap  so it s not a bad way to hedge your exposure for the remainder of the quarter

144750,366265,STT,U S  retirement legislation aims to improve workplace saving  income options,news," The opinions expressed here are those of the author  a columnist for Reuters  
By Mark Miller
CHICAGO  Reuters    News flash  Members of Congress managed to walk and chew gum at the same time this week 
In the midst of the impeachment furor  U S  lawmakers advanced the first significant retirement legislation in 13 years  They included the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement  SECURE  Act of 2019 in a larger package of spending legislation headed for approval this week that will keep the federal government operating next year 
The SECURE Act will have a significant impact on the retirement landscape  and it enjoys broad bipartisan support  The bill passed the U S  House of Representatives in May  but it has been hung up since then in the Senate due to pet issues of a handful of senators  As recently as last week  Washington insiders were predicting that SECURE would be pushed into 2020 
But SECURE enjoys big time lobbying muscle from the insurance industry  which is now getting a huge Christmas gift  a safe harbor provision in the bill that makes it much easier for employers to offer annuity products through their retirement plans  
Annuities   which provide a steady stream of income over a specified time or for life   do not sell very well  but getting them in front of 401 k  participants at the point of retirement could be a very profitable game changer for the industry  And a legitimate case for annuities can be made for some retirees  With fewer workers expecting a traditional defined benefit pension  annuities offer a way to guarantee some amount of income in retirement  mitigating longevity risk 
 When you ask people about their key fears in retirement  the worry that they will outlive their money is always near the top of the list   said Melissa Kahn  managing director for retirement policy at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors 
Just 10  of plans offered in plan annuities in 2018  according to research released by the Plan Sponsor Council of America on Wednesday  Employers usually take a cautious approach to changing their retirement plans  so adoption of in plan annuities likely will be slow  Meanwhile  the safe harbor provision of the bill has set off alarm bells among consumer advocates who worry the language does not go far enough to protect plan participants  
   The provision allows plan sponsors to rely on certifications by state insurance regulators that an insurance provider is financially sound 
 The state regulators put insurance companies through very rigorous tests on all of their capital requirements   said Kahn   And if they have been audited within five years  they cannot meet these certification requirements  
Consumer advocates urged lawmakers to limit the safe harbor to cover only simple income annuities  arguing that products such as fixed income and variable annuities are too complex and confusing for regulators to police  and for participants to understand 
 There s a reason the insurance industry has been lobbying nonstop to get this bill passed   it benefits them   said Micah Hauptman  financial services counsel at the Consumer Federation of America   But investors will end up paying the price  
IMPROVING 401 k  COVERAGE
SECURE includes a number of other provisions that could improve the outlook for retirement saving over the coming decade and beyond 
And make no mistake  federal legislation of this type can make a big difference  The last important retirement legislation was the Pension Protection Act of 2006  That law ushered in some major improvements in retirement plans  One has been the widespread adoption of target date funds  which add a measure of professional investment management for investors by automatically rebalancing the mix of equities and fixed income as retirement approaches  Another is automatic enrollment of new workers  which has sharply boosted participation rates 
But 10 years after the Great Recession  improvements in retirement security have been distributed very unevenly  Wealthier households have gained  but middle class and lower income households are treading water or are even less well off 
according to research by the Employee Benefit Research Institute 
The organization has a simulation model that estimates the percentage of households likely to have adequate resources to meet retirement expenses  The model   which takes into account savings  pensions  Social Security and even home equity   shows that among households aged 55 64  the top half of earners have very high odds of success in retirement  ranging from 79  to 93    Meanwhile  the second lowest income quartile has only 50 50 odds   and the lowest income group just 11  chance of success 
Moreover  just 52  of U S  households owned retirement accounts in 2016  according to Federal Reserve data  and the figures were much worse for black and Latino households  whose ownership rates were 33 6  and 27 8   respectively  
The SECURE Act addresses the coverage problem by making it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans to workers by banding together in multiple employer plans  Plans would be offered by private plan custodians  the idea is to entice employers with low costs and streamlined paperwork  and an increased tax credit to cover their setup costs 
 Most of the coverage gap is among smaller employers  and that is the fastest growing segment of the business community   notes Kahn   And they re the ones who struggle to provide any kind of retirement plan for their employees  
The SECURE Act also includes several provisions aimed at recognizing the changing demographics of retirement   namely  that people are working and living longer  The law will lift the starting age for required minimum distributions from retirement accounts to 72  from 70 1 2  It also repeals the age cap for traditional IRA contributions  currently 70 1 2  
The law also revises the rules for distributions from inherited IRA accounts  my colleague Beth Pinsker has more on that part of the story

3 Mutual Fund Misfires
Now  let s take a look at three market misfires 
Neuberger Berman International Equity C  NIQCX   Expense ratio  1 96   Management fee  1 04   Total annual fee  3   After expenses  the 5 year return is 2 2   meaning your fees are far higher than the fund s returns

Despite trade and political uncertainty  stocks are close to their record highs  The S P 500 ETF   ASX SPY   has gained about 19  this year its best performance in the first three quarters of a year since 1997  However  most of these gains came earlier this year  Third quarter was pretty volatile 
What lies ahead for the market 
The US economy remains on solid footing thanks mainly to a strong consumer and there appears to be little risk of an imminent recession  However  some of the recent economic reports have been lackluster  It also appears that we are in the late cycle environment  with flat or inverted yield curve and falling corporate profit margins 
The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting  There were three dissents though  for the first time since 2016 
Where is US economy headed in Q4  Should we expect more rate cuts by the Fed this year 
Technology is the best performing sector year to date  the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLK   is up about 31   and healthcare is among the worst  the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLV   has gained just about 4  
REITs and Utilities have also delivered strong performance this year as income focused investors found them attractive  The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ETF  and Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLU   have gained 27  and 22  respectively 
Which sectors are expected to outperform in Q4 
In early September  we saw some rotation out of hot areas of the market into out of favor areas like small caps and value but the trend was short lived 
Looking at valuations  US mid caps have exhibited attractive valuation on both absolute and relative terms  per State Street  The SPDR S P MIDCAP 400 ETF  has significantly outperformed both the large caps and small caps over the long term but is overlooked by investors 
Bond ETFs have seen huge inflows this year  Are there any opportunities in the fixed income space 
ETF fee wars have been escalating as investors have become increasingly cost conscious  However  they sometimes forget to look beyond expense ratio when evaluating ETF costs  Why should investors look at the total cost of ownership

144772,366287,STT,Which markets did best from Berlin Wall s collapse  Wall Street and the BRICs  of course,news,"By Marc Jones
LONDON  Reuters    The toppling of the Berlin Wall made free market economics the norm across Europe   but which financial markets have done the best since then  Wall Street and the BRICs  of course 
While the events of 1989 redefined Europe s boundaries  they also ushered in almost two decades of powerful economic liberalization and globalisation that took in China  India and Latin America   a wave that is only now cresting 
For a graphic on Latin American economic since the Berlin Wall fell  click 
They are not the only factor  by any means  Also at work is a 30 year drop in global borrowing costs as inflation has been beaten back   even amid a boom for commodity producers  whose resources China has gobbled up 
A reunited Germany cemented itself as Europe s largest economy  but an analysis of market performance suggests that the biggest winners are Wall St  flagbearer of Western capitalism  and the emerging  BRIC  economies   Brazil  India  China and Russia 
Since Nov  9  1989  the S P 500 has surged 1 635  in value  stocks in eastern Europe s largest economy Poland are up 550   and Russia s Moex has risen nearly 900  since it became firmly establish in the late 90s 
That compares to a 350  rise in the reunified German DAX when calculated in dollar terms  320  in MSCI s broadest world stocks index  MIWD00000PUS   and nearly 460  in its global emerging market equivalent   MSCIEF 
 There are multiple stories here   said SEB Investment Management s global head of asset allocation  Hans Peterson 
 In combination with the growth in emerging markets when they were liberalized and when China opened up  there has been  the fall of  bond yields of course  and we have killed off inflation  more or less  
For a graphic on Global markets since the fall of the Berlin Wall  click 
Borrowing on global capital markets has also exploded as part of the liberalization 
Data analyzed by  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors shows that most of the  120 trillion worth of emerging market debt in the world has been issued since the fall of the Wall  Over  40 trillion of that is in China though  including  27 trillion in the last 10 years alone  In comparison  Russia has only around  2 trillion  partly as a result of Western sanctions brought in over the last five years as relations have soured again 
 China is now the world s second largest bond market   said State Street s Abhishek Kumar   That is the really significant thing  
For a graphic on EM debt issuance  click 
Currencies have had to ride out devaluations and various debt or financial crises  Russia s rouble has halved in value against the dollar since Soviet times  whereas a deutsche mark euro amalgam is fractionally higher 
The big winner by far in economic growth terms behind the former Iron Curtain has been Poland  where GDP has ballooned by almost  600 billion  Next best have been  250 billion improvements in the Czech Republic and Romania 
In Asia  it has been overwhelmingly China  which now has an economy worth nearly  14 trillion a year  It had been gradually opening since the death of Chairman Mao in 1976  but picked up considerable speed in the 1990s  and joined the World Trade Organization in 2001

REBUILDING BARRIERS
The question many economists and investors are now asking  however  is whether these moves may be reversing 
The U S  and China are locked in a trade war  Relations between Western countries and Moscow have chilled rapidly since Russia s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and accusations that it meddled in the 2016 U S  election  which Moscow denies 
Poland is ruled by an avowedly nationalist  eurosceptic party and Hungary and Serbia have been getting closer to Russia again 
In an Open Society poll published on Friday of around 12 500 citizens in Central and Eastern Europe  a majority of respondents in Slovakia  61    Hungary  58    Romania  58    Bulgaria  56    Germany  52   and Poland  51   believed democracy was currently under threat 
Markets have not yet taken a definitive view  but are grappling with the reality that most central banks have taken interest rates as low as they can go  and countries  growth and finances is being sapped as their populations get older 
China s blue chip stocks have underperformed the S P 500 by almost 30  since the outbreak of the trade war  but Russia s stock and bond markets are some of the best performing this year  and many of Eastern Europe s markets are flying too 
 I think the momentum of  89 is almost at its limits today   said Didier Saint Georges  managing director of the 35 billion euro asset manager Carmignac 
 There is a huge rebellion against  political and economic  liberalism  It is being hugely challenged

144774,366289,STT,Fund managers deploy machines to decipher British election riddle,news,"By Saikat Chatterjee  Sujata Rao and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON  Reuters    Question  How do you predict the outcome of a snap election when so many polls have been so wrong  half of voters haven t made up their minds and the crucial factor may not be who wins  but how much they win by 
Answer  Unclear 
So financial investors  who could make or lose fortunes on the result of Britain s Dec  12 vote  are taking matters into their own hands and arming themselves with every predictive tool at their disposal   from artificial intelligence analysis to private polling and sports betting techniques 
Faced with such an unpredictable and financially pivotal election  fund managers say they can t put their faith in pollsters who failed to accurately call the last two British elections and dramatically dropped the ball on Brexit and Trump 
 In the past opinion polls accounted for 85  of your input  now maybe it s 30    said Stephen Jen  macro hedge fund manager at London based Eurizon SLJ   The world has become so complicated that polls  the standard metrics of the past  don t capture the picture anymore  
Reuters interviewed more than two dozen big investors  including  Aviva   LON AV   Legal and General  NN Investment Partners   State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors and M G Investments 
Most said they had turned to AI based tools that variously analyzed news reports  social media  web traffic  opinion polls and betting odds to decipher how the vote might play out 
Brexit has scrambled traditional political allegiances  with Prime Minister Boris Johnson s ruling Conservatives pledging a swift split from the EU  the main opposition Labour promising another referendum and others vowing to stay in the bloc 
It will not be enough for Johnson simply to win more seats than any other party   he needs a parliamentary majority to ensure Brexit happens  Any other outcome is likely to lead to a second referendum on EU membership 
Given the stakes  recent studies show almost half the electorate are now considered undecided  floating voters  
 Frankly  this election is by far the most difficult to call in living memory   said Edward Shing  global head of equity derivatives strategy at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  
SCRAPING FOR SENTIMENT
Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen  who oversees almost 300 billion euros at NN Investment Partners  said he was using the social media analysis services of MarketPsych to monitor the mood among voters 
MarketPsych  which sells its products through data company Refinitiv  tracks almost 3 000 sites  searching for expressions related to certain subjects 
Ahead of elections  it can track public sentiment toward issues like a change of government and social tensions  said Eric Fischkin  director quant and feeds at Refinitiv  in which Thomson Reuters  the parent company of Reuters News  holds a 45  stake 
 On both those parameters  the index is at its highest since the Brexit referendum   he added   If those indexes are marching upwards during an election it means that a higher share of the total media buzz is around those topics  
Using social media analysis to make political calculations is largely unproven  However Henrik Mueller  a professor at Dortmund University  argues it could be a key tool to gauge the mood of Britain s highly charged political scene 
In a paper for the Bruegel Institute think tank  he detailed how Twitter derived sentiment analysis he had conducted before the 2016 Brexit referendum reflected the swing towards Leave sooner and more accurately than opinion polls and bookmakers 
 The UK situation is unique  it s an ideal environment for this kind of analysis because the public is polarized around one question   Brexit   which is easier to track on social media   Mueller told Reuters 
But such techniques failed to yield clear signals for the 2018 Italian election  and before the 2017 French election at least one social media  scraping  company wrongly predicted victory for far right Marine le Pen 
Demand from investors has spawned a raft of companies selling various brands of data analysis  U S  based Predata  for example  applies machine learning algorithms to web traffic data to generate indicators that it sells to financial customers 
The company  which studies the sources and scale of traffic rather than content  said analysis in early November showed a spike in research into new voter registrations in Britain 
This was driven by people browsing on phones  rather than computers   with the mobile based traffic four times higher than at a similar point before the 2017 election 
 One assumption we can make is  this is generally associated with a younger audience   said Eric Falcon  Predata s director of research 
Engagement by younger voters  who are likelier to be anti Brexit  could be considered a negative for the Conservatives 
 MADE A TON OF MONEY 
British parliamentary seat projections are complicated by a first past the post voting system   in each of the 650 electoral districts  the candidate with the most votes wins the seat  This can undermine gauges of the overall national vote 
While opinion polls show the Conservatives around 10 points ahead  BNP Paribas noted that at this point in the 2017 campaign  the party had an even bigger lead  only to see it evaporate by election day 
A model created by pollsters YouGov shows the Conservatives on track to win 359 seats but has a margin of error of 50 either way   the difference between a majority and a hung parliament  potentially Brexit and no Brexit 
 The uniqueness of the UK election makes polling less useful   said Peter Fitzgerald  chief investment officer for multi asset at Aviva Investors   What you actually need to do is effectively look at 650 mini referendums  
Said Haidar  chief investment officer of macro hedge fund firm Haidar Capital Management  said he found bookmaker betting odds a more accurate predictor than opinion polls 
Using odds  as well as following news reports and polls  he said he correctly predicted the result of the Brexit referendum and  made a ton of money  in related bets 
Betting exchanges such as Betfair have indeed done a better job of predicting the outcomes of some votes  a Cambridge University study credited punters with cottoning on to the result of the Brexit referendum hours before financial markets 
 NO BAD THING FOR RISK TAKERS 
Yet betting markets may not provide as good a gauge for elections as they do for binary referenda  The amount wagered is also tiny against the multi billion dollar currency and bond markets 
In an indication of investor uncertainty  average daily cash volumes for sterling traded against the dollar and the euro fell to  45 billion in November as players sat on the sidelines ahead of the election  according to CLS  a major settler of foreign exchange trades  That compares with the  87 billion traded before the Brexit referendum in June 2016 
Despite polls consistently showing a healthy Conservative lead  currently seen as bullish for sterling  it has remained below  1 30  pointing to markets  wariness about the projections 
Some investors  such as Aviva s Fitzgerald  have commissioned private polls  while others have sought to extract the maximum value from the public surveys using data analysis companies like Neudata 
Neudata provides hedge funds with metadata sets  assessed and ranked by their track record and can provide sets showing which pollsters have been most accurate during past elections  said founder Rado Lipus 
It remains to be seen which strategies  if any  will prove effective  but Jen of Eurizon SLJ said a lack of faith in opinion polls could work to investors  advantage 




 If polls are not reliable you can argue that s not a bad thing for risk takers   he said   If nothing is priced in  you don t need some extraordinary event to make money  you just need to beat the average  ",2019-12-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fund-managers-deploy-machines-to-decipher-british-election-riddle-2032225,2032225

What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes  a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment 
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency 
However  some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection  and choose a different type of fund that tracks non cap weighted strategies  smart beta 
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  non cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such 
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices  from equal weighting  one of the simplest strategies  to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility momentum based weighting  However  not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns

144799,366314,STT,JPMorgan Joins Rivals in Cutting Weeks Old Targets,news," Bloomberg     The pain from the Fed s rate cuts is a little worse than the biggest U S  banks expected 
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  reduced the annual net interest income target it set two months ago  joining  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   and  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  in lowering the bar this week  Longer term rates have continued to fall as investors expect the Federal Reserve to continue the cuts it began in July 
JPMorgan s net interest income will likely be around  57 billion this year  Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Tuesday at an investor conference in New York  That s down from the  57 5 billion it targeted in July  which was a  500 million cut from what it expected in April 
Banks  traditional lending businesses have profited from the Fed s march upward that began in late 2015  as they passed on the higher rates to borrowers while keeping deposit rates low  Investors have fretted about how banks will handle the turnabout  causing their stocks to trail the broader market despite record earnings and buybacks 
The four commercial banking giants all missed analysts  estimates for net interest income in the second quarter  and most set a lower bar for the latter half of 2019 
Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said Monday that NII will likely drop 6  from last year  the second time this year it s cut that outlook  Citigroup CFO Mark Mason said his bank will probably see a 3  to 4  increase in NII this year  down from earlier guidance of 4

144800,366315,STT,Divided Fed set to cut interest rates this week  but then what ,news,"By Ann Saphir SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Deep disagreements within the Federal Reserve over the economic outlook and how the U S  central bank should respond will not stop policymakers from cutting interest rates at a two day meeting that begins on Tuesday  While an oil price spike after attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend added to the list of risks facing an economy already slowed by ongoing trade tensions and global weakness  the deep divide evident around the Fed s policymaking table means further rate cuts could be far from a done deal  At one end of the Fed s massive boardroom sit St  Louis Fed President James Bullard and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  who are expected to argue for a steep reduction in borrowing costs to counter low inflation and an inverted Treasury yield curve  Pushback from the opposite end is likely to come from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  who opposed the Fed s rate cut in July  and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker  who only reluctantly supported it and says he wants to leave rates where they are  to see how things play out   Fed Chair Jerome Powell  seated midway down the table  faces the delicate task of taking on board those views and the disparate arguments of the other dozen policymakers to build consensus    To cut or not to cut      Communications breakdown    A top challenge  making sense of economic data that suggests the U S  manufacturing industry may be contracting and inflation remains weak  even as households continue to spend and employers overall are adding plenty of jobs    The discord is extremely visible   said Gregory Daco  chief U S  economist at Oxford Economics   If you look at the economy today  you look at an economy that s bifurcated     The key question is whether that weakness seeps through the economy  and whether that s aggravated   Since the Fed s 8 2 decision to cut rates in July  a move that Powell called a  mid cycle  adjustment  the economic data has delivered mixed signals  Strong retail sales and continued wage growth may add to Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren s confidence that current economic conditions do not justify further policy easing  He dissented in the July policy decision  The ongoing U S  China trade war makes Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan among others concerned about slowing factory output and a slide in business investment  Kaplan supported July s rate cut   MIXED OPINION  The newest wild card to factor in to the debate emerged unexpectedly in Saturday s attacks on the Saudi oil facilities  which triggered the biggest spike in oil prices in more than two decades   Fed officials could see the development either as a risk to an already fragile growth outlook  which would support the case for more easing  or as a welcome boost to inflation  which would back a case for standing still for now   Traders of futures contracts tied to the Fed s policy rate were pricing in  as of Monday afternoon  a 65 8  chance that the central bank would cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1 75  to 2  on Wednesday   And even though the conviction for further rate hikes has softened since last week  traders overall continue to expect one more reduction in borrowing costs by the end of the year    If everyone was on the same page at the Fed I could understand it   said Lee Ferridge  head of macro strategy for North America at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Markets   But clearly there is disagreement at the Fed     If the Fed is very split and Powell can t give a strong signal  doesn t that imply very few moves are likely  rather than these dramatic cuts    Fed policymakers will bring to the meeting their own views of where rates should be by December  In June  the last time they published their forecasts  about half of policymakers expected a total of two rate cuts this year  about half thought no rates would be appropriate   That divide in the so called Fed  dot plot  has borne little relation to how policy has actually shaped up  but it could add to confusion over the rate outlook after the conclusion of this week s meeting

144801,366316,STT,Gold Prices Edge Lower as Fed Refuses to Join Race to the Bottom,news,"Investing com    Gold prices edged lower on Thursday  still under pressure from a Federal Reserve meeting that suggested the U S  is still far from joining the  race to the bottom  on interest rates that other central banks have embarked on in recent months 
Although the Fed delivered the expected 25 basis point cut in the target range for Fed funds as expected  they failed to deliver the looser policy message that the market wanted  said Antoine Lesn   head of EMEA strategy and research for SPDR ETFs at   State Street    NYSE STT  
 This less dovish backdrop may weigh on risk assets  while yields could rise a little more   Lesne said in e mailed comments   Meanwhile the case for a strong dollar remains well anchored  
A strong dollar and rising bond yields are traditionally bad news for gold  which has no nominal return and which is priced in a currency that not everyone outside the U S  has access to 
As such  gold futures had fallen as low as  1 492 a troy ounce after the Fed s meeting on Wednesday  but they recovered most of those losses Thursday as bargain hunters bought the dip 
By 10 30 AM ET  Gold Futures for delivery on the Comex exchange were at  1 509 85 an ounce  down only 0 4  on the day and only  8 below where they were immediately before the Fed s news broke 
Spot gold was up 0 5  at  1 501 51 
Other haven assets were also well supported  albeit still off recent highs  Silver Futures were up 0 1  at  17 94 an ounce while platinum future were up 0 7  at  941 20 
Away from the U S   the global monetary easing trend stayed intact  with both Hong Kong and Indonesia cutting their respective benchmark rates in the wake of the Fed action  The central bank of Brazil had also cut its key rate to a new record low of 5 5  on Wednesday 
Two other haven assets  the Swiss franc and Japanese yen  both strengthened against the dollar after their respective central banks declined to follow the Fed in easing at their policy meetings  although both indicated they still had the scope and will to if necessary  The Bank of England also sat on its hands  still boxed in by the threat of a disorderly Brexit ",2019-09-19,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/gold-prices-edge-lower-as-fed-refuses-to-join-race-to-the-bottom-1981812,1981812
144802,366317,STT,Dollar on back foot after U S  service sector survey fans recession worries,news,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO  Reuters    The dollar stepped back on Friday after a soft U S  service sector survey inflamed worries that pressure from U S  trade disputes with China and other countries could spill over into the broader U S  economy and eventually tip it into a recession 
The dollar index   USD  fell to 98 816  shedding about 0 9  after hitting a 2 1 2 year high this week  It is down 0 3  on the week 
Against the yen  the U S  currency eased to 106 78 yen   down 0 15  and having fallen to one month low of 106 48 in U S  trade on Thursday 
The euro  which had been dogged by concerns Germany could slip into a recession  rose 0 15  to  1 0980  EUR    extending its recovery from a near 2 1 2 year low of  1 0879 set on Tuesday 
The common currency has gained 0 34  so far on the week 
A survey from the U S  Institute for Supply Management  ISM  showed its non manufacturing activity index falling to 52 6 in September  the lowest since August 2016  and far below expectations of 55 1  from 56 4 in August 
Coming on the heels of a similar survey on Tuesday on manufacturing showing activity plunging to a more than 10 year lows  the weak data increased fears of a U S  recession 
The U S  service sector  backed by firm U S  domestic consumption  has been one of few bright spots in the global economy as the manufacturing sector worldwide has been knocked by the protracted U S China trade war 
 People have been saying that U S  domestic demand will remain strong even as its external demand weakens  But as time passes by  U S  consumption will be inevitably affected by what s happening outside  Companies are getting more cautious about hiring and spending   said Minori Uchida  chief currency strategist at MUFG Bank 
A gauge of employment in the ISM survey in fact fell to 50 4 last month  the lowest reading since February 2014  from 53 1 in August 
That does not bode well for the upcoming all important U S  jobs data on Friday  said Daisuke Uno  chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank  noting the employment component in the ISM has had a meaningful correlation with the payrolls data 
 It is reasonable to think the non farm payrolls figure is more likely than not to come on the disappointing side  It could even fall below zero   he said 
The median economists  forecast polled by Reuters is for a rise of 145 000 in September  a tad below the average over the last 12 months around 173 000 
Heightened worries about the U S  service sector increased expectations that the U S  Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the end of this month  undermining the dollar s yield advantage 
Fed funds rate futures   are almost fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut at Oct  30 and a high chance of another cut by December 
But some market players think rate cuts are far from a done deal 
 Opinions in markets over whether the Fed needs to cut rates that much are divided  The dollar is not going to fall sharply given not everyone thinks the Fed will cut rates this month   said Kazushige Kaida  forex manager at  State Street   NYSE STT  
Elsewhere  sterling traded at  1 2333   up 0 2  on the day 
It has risen to one week high of  1 2413 on Thursday after the head of a group of euroskeptic lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson s Conservative Party said the government s latest Brexit proposals offered the possibility of a  tolerable deal

144807,366322,STT,State Street Stock Flashes Bear Sign During Earnings Week,opinion,"Bank stocks have been a major focus this week  with Citigroup  NYSE C  unveiling an impressive earnings report on Monday  and several sector peers slated to report later this week  This list includes State Street Corporation  NYSE NYSE STT   which will unveil its second quarter earnings before the open this Friday  July 19  While it s been a relatively good run for the financial sector so far  a technical signal just flashed on the charts for State Street that might put the stock in hot water before its report 
By taking a look at STT s recent behavior  it s clear the stock has been struggling  While a floor at the  54 area has kept it from dropping back towards its roughly three year low of  53 53  the security has recently found a ceiling at its 20 day moving average  and as mentioned before  just came within one standard deviation of its historically bearish 40 day trendline 
According to data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  this signal has sounded seven times during the past few years  One month later  STT was in the red 67  of the time  averaging a loss of 5 4   At State Street s current perch of  54 62  a similar move would have the equity bottoming out at a fresh low  around  51 67 

Historically  State Street s post earnings performance hasn t fared so well  either  with the stock finishing below breakeven the day after five of its last eight earnings reports    including an 8 5  plummet last October  averaging a 4 1  post earnings swing during the last two years  This time around the options market is pricing in a slightly bigger move  at 6 5  
While the majority of analysts are cautious over the financial concern  with eight in coverage calling it a  hold  or worse  there s plenty of room for downgrades to push the security even lower  since six members of the brokerage bunch still call State Street a  buy  or better  Plus  The consensus 12 month target price of  63 21 hasn t been touched by the equity since May  and sits at a roughly 16  premium to current levels

144824,366339,STT,If This Really Is a Fed Easing Cycle  Where Are Markets Headed ,news," Bloomberg     Treasury two year yields may slide to 1  by the end of 2020 as the Federal Reserve makes a succession of interest rate cuts to support growth   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   says  The dollar is set to slide in that scenario  according to Pacific Investment Management Co 
 We re at a point where we re weighing whether the Fed will cut for insurance or if they re entering a period of structural  cyclical downturn in interest rates    I m leaning more towards the latter   said Shyam Devani  senior technical strategist at Citigroup in Singapore   I wouldn t be surprised if we see two year yields dropping to 1  by the end of next year  
Citi is forecasting the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by 25 basis points this month and potentially cut another two times by year end   Inflation expectations remain low  we have a global slowdown in growth and commodity prices remain weak   he said   The Fed could cut well into next year  
Traders are pricing in about 75 basis points of easing by year end after Chairman Jerome Powell s dovish testimony to Congress on Wednesday  when he cited slowing global expansion and trade tensions as threats to the U S  economy  The Treasury two year yield was three basis points lower at 1 80  in London trading after sliding eight basis points on Wednesday 
Pimco s View
Whether the dollar is poised for a prolonged decline depends on how the central bank positions its July move    especially if it s the beginning of a cycle  said Erin Browne  a managing director and portfolio manager at Pimco in Newport Beach  California 
 What really matters is  is this an insurance cut or a sustained move lower   she said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday   If it s a sustained move lower  I think the curve steepens fairly significantly from here and we could start to see the dollar really roll over  
The dollar would be particularly vulnerable against the euro and potentially the yen should the Fed embark on a series of rate cuts  Browne said  The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0 2  on Thursday  extending its decline to 1 6  from this year s high set in May 
Powell s remarks not only failed to push back against the rate cut that s fully priced in for July  they boosted the rate cut narrative  Andrew Hollenhorst  chief U S  economist at Citigroup in New York  wrote in a research note 
A 50 basis point cut in July is a real possibility  though a 25 basis point move is likely to be the compromise policy outcome  he said 
Here s what other market participants are saying

Powell s testimony  is a good potential catalyst for a resumption of the USD weakness we saw last month   analysts including Shahid Ladha said

144825,366340,STT,Markets brace for volatility surge as currencies enter trade war,news,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON  Reuters    China s decision to let its yuan plunge through a previously sacrosanct level means a tit for tat trade conflict could morph into a currency war  injecting volatility into long dormant foreign exchanges and piling pressure on world markets 
Beijing on Monday allowed the yuan to breach the 7 per dollar level for the first time in 11 years  a move seen as a direct response to U S  President Donald Trump s escalation of their trade conflict through more tariffs 
China s willingness to use its currency to offset the impact of a year long trade dispute is of huge symbolic  if not economic  importance  it shows Beijing is prepared to use its currency as a tool to respond asymetrically to Trump s levies 
For global markets  the move opens up a new front that could dramatically raise volatility in the forex market after a prolonged period of calm  especially if it emboldens others to try to weaken their currencies to shield their economies from a global downturn 
 This is the formal introduction of currencies into the trade war   said Richard Benson  head of portfolio investments at foreign exchange asset manager Millennium Global 
 If anything  it had been currency stability that was used within the trade war  Now this is an overt  explicit move by the Chinese in response to Trump s tariffs   Benson added 
Benson said it had become extremely difficult to predict where currencies were headed from here   economic fundamentals told you to buy the dollar  DXY   EUR EBS   but the risk Trump may hit back encouraged some selling of the greenback 
On Monday  the immediate winners and losers were clear 
The yuan suffered its biggest drop since 2015   although analysts noted that the fall seemed orderly and Chinese authorities comfortable with the move so far 
STEEP LOSSES
Elsewhere pretty much any country with a small  open economy tied to globalization saw its currency plunge  Emerging markets were whacked across the board  with steep losses for instance in the trade sensitive South Korean won  
The safe haven Japanese yen  surged to a seven month high below 106 yen per dollar  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  brought forward its forecast of 103 yen to three months 
Japan s top currency diplomat warned investors Tokyo was ready to intervene if excessive yen gains threatened to hurt its export reliant economy

Investors say a more dramatic fallout for markets depends on how the United States responded from here  While forex volatility  has risen to its highest in four months  it is barely half of 2016 levels 
Trump has a number of levers at his disposal should he try to weaken the dollar  from leaning on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to outright unilateral intervention 
On Monday  he tweeted that China s  currency manipulation  was a  major violation  which would weaken the country over time  He also asked if the Federal Reserve  which he has frequently attacked for not cutting rates   was listening  
HIGHLY DEBATABLE
Most analysts believe Trump is unlikely to resort to intervention  given this would upend decades of commitment to leave currency markets alone  while the effectiveness of such a move remains highly debatable 
Last month top White House adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration had ruled out intervention  dampening   although not eliminating   market expectations the U S  would act 
 GRAPHIC   History of U S  FX intervention   
James Binny   State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors  global head of currency  said an intervention looked more effective as a  threat in the armoury   If Washington actually intervened it could backfire   given an attempted devaluation that panicked financial markets would send investors to buy the safety of the dollar 
According to Citi analysts  another 5  or so appreciation in the dollar was necessary before the intervention risk was  live  
Still  whether or not the U S  intervenes directly  China s salvo makes it more likely that countries will increasingly weaponize their currencies in the race to maintain economic competitiveness in a world of slowing growth  fund managers say 
European Central Bank policymakers  for example  have said the strength of the euro is a key reason for signaling more monetary policy easing  sources told Reuters ahead of such a move last month 
The Swiss National Bank appears to be buying foreign currency once again as the trade tensions pushed the value of its safe haven franc to two year highs against the euro  EURCHF EBS   currency of its biggest trading partner 
BIG NUMBER
China s massive role in global trade also means moves in the yuan reverberate much more powerfully and widely than they once did 
The yuan is the biggest component in the euro s trade weighted index  and a weakening yuan comes at a time when the euro zone economy cannot cope with it  noted Kit Juckes  a strategist at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  
 GRAPHIC   The yuan  a leader and follower of global FX   
Millennium s Benson said he was steering clear of emerging currencies and reckoned the yen could rally to 105 per the dollar  The  big number  for many in the market was 100 yen  he said  a level last hit in 2016 
Commerzbank  DE CBKG  analysts said   Over the short term  we believe that the market will remain extremely volatile and the risk for both the economy and yuan are biased to the downside 
 The market implications of breaching 7 0  yuan per dollar  are tremendous   Commerzbank analysts added   We will see a new wave of depreciation among Asian currencies in the foreseeable future and there could be further risk off movements in the global markets

144826,366341,STT,U S  Treasury bond curve inverts for first time since 2007 in recession warning,news,"LONDON  Reuters    The U S  Treasury bond yield curve inverted on Wednesday for the first time since 2007  in a sign of investor concern that the world s biggest economy could be heading for recession 
The inversion    a situation where shorter dated borrowing costs are higher than longer ones    saw U S  2 year note yields rise above the 10 year bond yield 
The curve inverted to as much as minus 1 7 basis points by 1045 GMT  
 GRAPHIC   US Treasury curve inverts   
Such an inversion  considered a classic recession signal  occurred last in June 2007 when the U S  sub prime mortgage crisis was gathering pace  US2YT RR   US10YT RR   The U S  curve has inverted before every recession in the past 50 years  offering a false signal just once in that time 
 Historically the U S  curve was always thought of as a recession signal and it remains to see if that s still the case  The world certainly seems a less safe place   said Tim Graf  chief macro strategist at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors 
Weak economic data and inflation  global trade tensions and risks such as the consequences of Brexit have driven concern about world growth  fuelling market expectations of central bank rate cuts and sparking hefty falls in government bond yields 
The U S  30 year Treasury yield tumbled to a record low of 2 05  on Wednesday  In Germany  the 10 year bond yield fell to a record low of  0 64  after data showed the euro zone s powerhouse economy shrank in the second quarter 
 The yield curve inversion is a bad omen for the economy   said Arne Petimezas  an analyst at AFS in Amsterdam 
 Inversions in crucial segments of the yield curve have always heralded recessions  However  typically central banks ignore the warning signal  They often cut too little or too late  
Elsewhere  yield curves have been less accurate in predicting downturns but Germany s was at its flattest since 2008  DE2YT RR   DE10YT RR  
Britain s bond yield curve also inverted on Wednesday for the first time since the global financial crisis  
In March  the inversion of the U S  yield curve hit 3 month T bills for the first time in about 12 years when the yield on 10 year notes  US10YT RR  dropped below those for 3 month securities 
That metric reverted back and then inverted again in May  Over that period  the 2  10 year curve did not invert 
Some have cast doubt on how accurate the yield curve remains as a recession predictor after a decade of multi trillion dollar central bank money printing stimulus 
Graf said the backdrop now was not a  perfect apples to apples comparison  to the last curve inversion episode  which happened just over a year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent the world economy into a tailspin 
 The supply demand dynamics for safe assets are different and to some degree it explains why the curve inversion may last longer without portending recession  than during past episodes  ",2019-08-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-treasury-bond-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-2007-in-recession-warning-1954774,1954774

144828,366343,STT,Argentine peso gets knocked lower  country risk soars as government eyes debt  reprofiling ,news,"By Hugh Bronstein and Walter Bianchi
BUENOS AIRES  Reuters    Argentina s peso slumped on Thursday and its country risk soared to levels not seen since 2005 after the government announced plans to  reprofile  about  100 billion of its debt  leaving investors scrambling to assess what kind of hit they might face 
The recession  and inflation racked country s latest woes began when business friendly President Mauricio Macri suffered an unexpectedly harsh defeat in an Aug  11 primary election at the hands of populist leaning Peronist Alberto Fernandez 
That unnerved investors  who feared that the return of the left to power could herald another debt restructuring in Latin America s third largest economy 
By the time Treasury Minister Hernan Lacunza said on Wednesday the government wanted to extend the maturities  of short term local debt instruments and would negotiate with holders of its sovereign bonds and with the International Monetary Fund  a debt revamp was already widely expected 
The peso nonetheless fell 2 6  to 59 65 per U S  dollar  having lost 24  of its value since Macri s primary vote debacle all but erased his chances of being re elected in October 
Argentine spreads over safe haven U S  Treasury bonds  which measures perceived risk of default  rose 177 basis points higher to 2 249 on Thursday on JP Morgan s Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus 
The Merval  MERV  stock index sank 4  at the open amid uncertainty over the government s ability to carry out the debt reprofiling so close to the presidential election in October  The Merval has plunged more than 45  since the primary vote 
Developing markets investment house Tellimer calculates that  7 billion of short term debt   50 billion long term debt and  44 billion of IMF debt may be earmarked for an overhaul 
Lacunza labelled the operation a  reprofiling  of obligations that will affect institutional rather than individual investors 
He said he would send a bill to Congress to approve changes to bonds governed by local law  Talks with holders were expected to start soon  but would likely be concluded by the government that wins the October general election and takes office in December  Fernandez is now the clear front runner 
 We remain cautious   Citi said in a note   While we think the short term funding needs have been addressed  political uncertainty remains high  any proposal on global bonds could be unwound by the potential new administration  
 PRE EMPTIVE ANNOUNCEMENT 
The central bank spent  367 million of its reserves in foreign exchange market interventions on Wednesday alone  part of its effort to defend the beleaguered local peso 
 The pre emptive announcement from the Macri administration to voluntarily re profile debt shows cash flow desperation after consistent foreign exchange reserve loss   said Siobhan Morden  head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York 
 It now looks like a disorderly phase of a debt restructuring with a piecemeal strategy of seeking debt relief without a comprehensive debt repayment plan   Morden said in a note  adding   capital controls could quickly follow as this official recognition of cash flow stress will only trigger further dollar demand and capital flight  
Key players going forward will be the IMF  which has a  57 billion standby loan deal with Argentina and Fernandez  who is now the front runner to become president at the end of the year 
Fernandez has said he wants to renegotiate the IMF pact  which calls for unpopular austerity measures that had damaged Macri s popularity and set him up for the drubbing he took in the primary vote 
A crunch point could be Sept  15  when the next IMF loan tranche   about  5 4 billion   is due to be disbursed 
 The re profiling was already in the prices   said Alberto Bernal  chief emerging markets strategist at XP Investments in New York 
 I expect the IMF to be supportive of the decision  not least because the IMF is already fully involved here   he added   As far as I understand this transaction does not trigger CDS  credit default swaps   but will force rating agencies to declare that Argentina is now once again in Selective Default  
Selective default is when a country fails to make payments on one debt obligation but makes good on others 
THE FERNANDEZ FACTOR
A major question is how Fernandez will react to the reprofiling plan  considering he may become president in December  He had not made any public comments as of Thursday 
 Having been of the idea that Argentina faces not only liquidity but also solvency issues  we doubt maturity extensions would effectively solve Argentina s problems    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  said in a note 
 In our view  risk reward remains skewed to the downside  considering the confusions and uncertainties surrounding these announcements  including  but not limited to  how Fernandez will react   the note said 
Restructurings are a traumatic subject for voters who remember the country s 2001 2002 default  which punctuated an economic meltdown that tossed millions of middle class Argentines into poverty  Subsequent mini defaults kept the country locked out of global capital markets for years 
Macri prided himself on getting the country out of default early in his administration and promised to reintegrate Argentina with the global markets  But Macri overestimated his ability to attract the foreign direct investment needed to provide Argentina with sustained economic growth 
Weakness in the peso has meanwhile eaten away at the government s ability to repay its dollar denominated obligations 
The reprofiling will first apply to short dated debt denominated in pesos as well as dollars but issued under local law  Lacunza said  The measure will require approval from Congress 
While markets understood the plan targets short term domestic sovereign debt denominated in dollars or Argentine pesos  it was still unclear how international investors might be affected 
Some welcomed Argentina s efforts to tackle its debt burden 
 They haven t got the money  so some adjustment is necessary   said Abhishek Kumar  lead emerging markets portfolio manager at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors 
 The measures they take are still unknown  but anything is good because it realigns to the reality  ",2019-08-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/argentine-peso-gets-knocked-lower-country-risk-soars-as-government-eyes-debt-reprofiling-1966430,1966430

The economy added 130 000 jobs  trailing the average estimate  while the unemployment rate held at 3 7  and hourly earnings were higher than forecast  It came out four hours before Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on monetary policy in Zurich  Here s how strategists and traders reacted 
Dennis DeBusschere  head of portfolio strategy  Evercore ISI This is bullish    keeps aggressive Fed  Powell is not rewriting his speech at 12 30 today on this number   Rates should be sideways and curve should steepen  It s positive for equities as the report speaks to longer expansion  It s positive for the same things that have worked  tech   Cyclicals fine on the day if risk assets move up  which they should  Given all the other consumer employment readings have been strong  people will likely discount the headline miss    especially given the huge jump in household employment 
Candice Bangsund  portfolio manager  Fiera Capital  The headline number was a mixed bag    something for both the hawks and the doves  What was encouraging is the jump in hourly earnings  particularly for inflation backdrop  We re likely to see another insurance cut in September and it s largely priced in  It may be a bit of a hawkish cut in that the Fed will signal in that it s not the beginning of a easing cycle and going forward they ll be in a wait and see mode  The numbers in the U S  We ve been seeing isn t consistent with a  the recession and b  four rate cuts the market is pricing it 
Bruce Bittles  chief investment strategist  Robert W  Baird  The print almost guarantees that the Fed is going to cut rates by 25 points  Yesterday s ADP  NASDAQ ADP  was higher than expected and if today s jobs numbers were higher  there could be a lot of questions about whether the Fed was going to cut rates this month  The print doesn t change anything  it solidifies the fact that the Fed is going to lower rates  Powell speaks later today  The Fed has pretty well signaled its stance on interest rates  Powell may confirm that today or make a little stronger statement 
Tony Bedikian  head of global markets  Citizens Bank Today s jobs report shows the resiliency of the United States economy despite several global headwinds  The on again  off again U S  China trade talks continue to roil markets and  in some ways  are mirroring the on again  off again Brexit debate  Both issues are providing market participants with more theater than substance while the U S  consumer tunes them out  keeps spending and keeps the U S  economic fundamentals on track 
JJ Kinahan  chief market strategist  TD Ameritrade  We re light on the number  August is always a strange report anyway  The reason I say that is because you have some of the summer jobs that are sort of rolling off as kids go back to school or the resorts or whatever that may be open in the summer that aren t the rest of the year  You also have the anomaly of the government hiring 25 000 workers for the census  You normally don t see that 
Ilya Feygin  senior strategist  WallachBeth Capital LLC The weak payrolls and higher hourly earnings are slightly negative for equities because they force us to deal with a slightly weaker economy but do not change the central bank rate path at all in our view  We would expect an eventual downtick in S P futures to the 2 970 area where they found support last night and then the 2 950 2 954 area

144846,366361,STT,Should You Buy Gold ETFs Now  ,opinion,"Gold has surged about 12  in the past month and is close to its highest level in six years now  thanks mainly to investors  search for safer assets amid rising market uncertainty and geopolitical tensions 
Rising hopes for a rate cut by the Fed also boosted the appeal of gold as lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of owning gold  A weaker dollar makes gold prices attractive to consumers in emerging markets like India and China  which are the world s top gold consumers 
Gold purchases by central banks have soared in recent years and this trend is expected to continue  During the first quarter  gold purchases by global central banks  led by Russia and China  were the highest in six year  according to the World Gold Council 
I believe that gold should be a small part of any investment portfolio  mainly due to its low correlation with other asset classes 
Physically backed gold ETFs provide low cost  convenient exposure to the metal  Investors should look at the expense ratio  trading costs and gold per share when selecting a gold ETF for their portfolio   
The SPDR Gold Trust  P GLD     is the largest and most liquid gold ETF  Each share of this ETF represents about 1 10th of an ounce of gold  It has an expense ratio of 0 40

144857,366372,STT,Column  U S  legislation will help retirement security  but bigger steps are needed,news,"By Mark Miller CHICAGO  Reuters    Federal policy on retirement security is one chaotic mess right now   Just consider the contradictory state of affairs when it comes to pensions and retirement income  On the one hand  a bill called the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement  SECURE  Act of 2019 is headed for passage with broad bipartisan support by the U S  Congress  The bill is a grab bag of retirement security initiatives  But notably  it includes a groundbreaking provision that will encourage employers to add annuities to their 401 k  plans that workers could select at the point of retirement  But on the other hand  the Trump administration earlier this year made it easier for pension plan sponsors to get rid of their benefit obligations by offering lump sum buyouts to retirees  This was a reversal by the Internal Revenue Service and U S  Department of the Treasury of an Obama era ban on lump sum buyouts for people who already are retired  The move likely will lead to a restarting of this so called de risking activity by plan sponsors  who have demonstrated eagerness to get pension liabilities off their books over the past decade  That is terrible news  because the lump sums usually are far less valuable to retirees than the lifetime income stream  And messing around with the income of people already in retirement  when there is less flexibility or time to make adjustments  is an especially dangerous idea  Pensions and annuities both help retirees by providing a guaranteed lifetime income stream  reducing the risk that they will run out of money  But here we have federal legislation that will encourage pension style annuity income   while regulators are encouraging exactly the opposite  Got that  The need for action is clear  Fewer workers will have traditional defined benefit pensions in the years ahead  Rising healthcare costs are projected to consume a greater share of Social Security benefits  A severe shortage of age appropriate housing is pushing us toward a crisis in shelter for older Americans  Meanwhile  one third of private sector workers had no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan in 2016  according to the United States Government Accountability Office  The coverage shortfall is greatest among low income workers and people working for small companies  SMALL BUSINESS SAVING PLAN  But the SECURE Act responds with a series of small bore initiatives  mostly focused on encouraging more saving for retirement  None are likely to move the needle in a big way  A key provision makes it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans to workers by banding together in multiple employer plans  or  open MEPS  for short  Plans would be offered by private plan custodians  the idea is to entice employers with low costs and streamlined paperwork  and an increased tax credit to cover their setup costs  But the open MEP concept has been bouncing around in Congress for years  and more competitive low cost options for small employers have surfaced since the open MEP idea was first hatched  Moreover  it is not clear how many plan providers will jump into this market  The SECURE Act also recognizes that more people are working longer  So it would raise the age when required minimum distributions from tax deferred savings accounts must begin to 72 from 70 5  and the maximum age for contributions to IRAs  also 70 5  would be eliminated  The bill also would require sponsors of 401 k  plans to include part time workers who meet certain qualifications  Meanwhile  the annuity provision creates a so called safe harbor that protects 401 k  plan sponsors from the risks associated with the long range nature of an annuity investment  The provision protects employers from liability if an annuity provider gets into trouble down the road and fails to make promised payments  That off loading of risk has drawn criticism from consumer advocates   but there also are questions about how much appeal in plan annuities will have for plan sponsors and participants  Plan sponsors typically take a conservative approach to changing their investment menus  And inertia and plan complexity are powerful obstacles to getting participants to make changes  The in plan annuity plank could get a boost from recent changes in the industry  which has moved to introduce more flexible products and also less expensive offerings  such as deferred annuities   It s not just immediate annuities anymore  where you hand over a lump sum of money all at once   said Melissa Kahn  managing director of retirement policy at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors   There are a lot of different options now that can meet different needs of plan participants and employers   Kahn notes that the SECURE Act also could encourage workers to choose at least partial annuitization via another provision requiring a disclosure of what participants can expect their savings to generate in monthly income   The lifetime income disclosure is critical for improving financial literacy   she said   Today s 401 k  statement just tells you how much is in your account   and for most people it s more than they ve ever seen in their lifetime in one place  so they think they are rich  But when you see what that will generate in income  it s a real wake up call   Fair enough  But the SECURE Act will not lead to a huge wave of annuitization anytime soon   So what policies would have a broader impact on retirement security  Federal policy aimed at preserving the pensions that still exist   rather than encouraging extinction   would be a great start  Legislation that fixes Social Security s looming shortfalls and expands benefits would be an enormous accomplishment  Another urgent  huge task for Congress is to address the solvency crisis facing multiemployer pension plans  which threatens the security of more than 1 million retired union workers  We need to get to the big ideas on retirement  and quick

144858,366373,STT,The Pound Looks Even Worse Than the Euro ,news," Bloomberg     The pound will tumble to levels not seen since 2017 against the euro as Brexit turmoil outweighs a dovish European Central Bank  according to analysts 
Sterling is likely to slide toward 92 pence per euro by year end  about 3  below current levels and a rate not seen in 21 months  according to JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   That pessimism toward the currency is starting to be priced in the options market  where the cost of puts relative to calls is approaching the highest since April 
The pound has slumped against the euro this quarter as the risks to Britain s currency from the contest to replace U K  Prime Minister Theresa May and October s Brexit deadline mount  The slide reflects investors  skepticism about the Bank of England s stance that rates may have to rise if the economy develops in line with its forecasts  With momentum slowing around the world  markets are  in fact  pricing in the chance of a BOE rate cut next year

144860,366375,STT,Yuan in Spotlight as Global Gauge of Stress as G 20 Starts,news," Bloomberg     Sign up for Next China  a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it s going next 
Forecasters penciling in year end projections for the yuan may want to keep their erasers handy this weekend  With the course of the U S  China trade war at stake  Saturday s presidential meeting has the potential for major implications for exchange rates 
Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping aren t likely to seal some new Plaza Accord    Chinese officials are keenly aware of the judgment that Japan s 1985 agreement to revalue the yen proved disastrous for its economy  But any progress in the Osaka sit down toward a broader trade deal  and even a promise to keep high level talks going without further protectionist moves  could relieve pressure on the yuan 
A Xi Trump breakdown could conversely roil the yuan  testing officials  readiness to hold the line at the psychologically important 7 per dollar level  which hasn t been seen since 2008  Such a move could in turn roil not only other Asian currencies that increasingly take their cue from the yuan  but demand for risk assets such as equities as well 
 Anything that infers progress on talks or prospective talks is likely to be as good as it gets    that will give risk another leg up   said Dwyfor Evans  head of Asia Pacific macro strategy at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Markets  But  once Osaka is removed from the equation  there is political space for Beijing to pursue renewed currency flexibility   with the yuan allowed to depreciate on account of the hit from trade and monetary easing  he said 
 Tremendous Pressure 
Both the U S  and China agree that the trade war has affected the yuan s exchange rate  Trump says the depreciation has been an intentional attempt to ease the cost of American tariff hikes  People s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said this month that  tremendous pressure  from the U S  had made the currency  a little bit weaker  
The broad consensus that s emerged among economists and strategists in the run up to the presidential tete a tete is some sort of a repeat of their Buenos Aires meeting last December  which    like the one scheduled for Saturday    was on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit  Trump and Xi agreed to a truce in the trade war and the resumption of talks 
Yet Trump has made clear in recent days he s keeping more tariff hikes on the table  making the weekend tough to predict  Another wild card  at least at one point  the Trump administration was pushing for a currency stability pledge in the bilateral talks  While Chinese officials have if anything lately moved to keep the yuan stable  such an outright pledge would contrast with the stated goal of the market setting the exchange rate 
 Handshake Agreement 
 Most likely we re going to see a handshake agreement that China and the U S are going to resume negotiations  but we may not see a lot of concrete steps coming out of that   said Becky Liu  head of China macro strategy at  Standard Chartered   LON STAN  Plc in Hong Kong  That sort of a consensus forecast outcome would leave the yuan within its current 6 85 to 6 95 range  she said 
The yuan was little changed at 6 8779 per dollar in Shanghai Friday morning  Liu said an escalation in tensions would send the yuan weaker  forcing the PBOC to intervene probably to protect 7 per dollar    even though Yi this month said no level mattered more than another  Upside for the yuan could be capped around 6 6  given China s economic fundamentals don t support sustained appreciation  she said 
China s economy continued to weaken in June    read more here 
The yuan could see a mild positive effect from a deal to resume talks  said Eswar Prasad  an economics professor at Cornell University and former International Monetary Fund economist  But  it is difficult to imagine there being enough progress on deescalation of trade tensions in the coming weeks that the yuan receives a significant positive boost   he said

after a stinging warning from German chemicals giant BASF about the effects of the global trade war and as hopes dwindled of a hefty U S  interest rate cut this month  With global macroeconomic clouds looming and markets waiting for policy signals from U S  Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell on Wednesday  the focus of headlines and sentiment turned to three individual heavyweight stocks   For Europe  it was an almost 7  early slump in German chemicals giant BASF after it had blamed a global slowdown and trade war between the United States and China for what one trader described as a

on Wall Street after a broker downgrade dragged both global tech sectors lower   EU   Both from a bottom up and top down perspective  equity market valuations appear far too ambitious   analysts at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  wrote in a note  It was particularly stark  they said  as the U S  business cycle was in a downturn and both forward looking indicators such as global PMIs and global trade are now in contraction territory    Indeed  companies have begun cutting their 2019 profit forecasts  citing the trade conflict as a reason   MS added   In the currency markets  Britain s pound was threatening to slip to a more than 2 year low against the dollar and a 6 month trough versus the euro amid a worsening UK economic outlook and rising fears about a no deal Brexit   GBP   With the key  1 25 level against the dollar giving way in early Asian trade  traders quickly pushed the British currency down half a percent and it barely budged  even as opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn inched closer to backing a second Brexit referendum  The broader theme though remained the potential reaction to the weaker global outlook from the world s top central banks  especially on what Fed chairman Powell will say during a testimony and grilling from Congress on Wednesday   FED DIARY   Money market futures  0 FF   are still fully pricing in a 25 basis point  bps  cut at the Fed s

also higher at 97 550  while the euro drooped back under  1 12 for the first since mid June    FRX   It would be pretty disruptive at this stage for Powell to rule out a cut in July or dampen expectations of a cut in July   said Michael Metcalfe  head of global macro strategy at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Markets   The last few Fed speakers  albeit non voting speakers  have suggested July is not a done deal     and even now  if you look at economists  forecasts  there is not a consensus that there will be a move  and yet the market is 100  priced    TRADE STRAINS Wall Street

 We re at a point where we re weighing whether the Fed will cut for insurance or if they re entering a period of structural  cyclical downturn in interest rates    I m leaning more towards the latter   said Shyam Devani  senior technical strategist in Singapore   I wouldn t be surprised if we see two year yields dropping to 1  by the end of next year  
Citigroup is forecasting the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by 25 basis points this month and potentially cut another two times by year end   Inflation expectations remain low  we have a global slowdown in growth and commodity prices remain weak   Devani said   The Fed could cut well into next year  
Traders increased bets on how much the Fed will cut rates to bolster U S  growth following Chairman Jerome Powell s dovish testimony to Congress on Wednesday  Markets are now pricing in about 75 basis points of easing by year end after Powell cited slowing global expansion and trade tensions as threats to the U S  economy

S P 500 Futures  Out Of The Way 
During Monday nights Globex session  the S P 500 futures  ESM19 CME  printed a high of 2916 75  a low of 2908 00  and opened Tuesday s regular trading hours at 2915 25 
The first move after the 8 30 CT bell was a quick dip down to 2912 25  followed by a stair stepper rally that would last until 9 30  and boost the ES up to 2924 50  After that  the bulls took over  and they were very serious 
Over the course of the next 2 hours the ES rallied nearly 20 handles without so much as a headfake to tease the bears  If you were short  you paid up  or you doubled up  Either way  it didn t pay to be a seller 
At around 11 00 things began to ease up  The futures pulled back a little  and the markets in general felt calmer  The ES went on to trade sideways in a 3 handle range for the rest of the morning and into the afternoon 
Going into the close  the futures traded 2934 75 when the 2 45 cash imbalance reveal showed  475M to sell  then went on to print 2937 00 on the 3 00 cash close  and 2938 50 on the 3 15 futures close 
In the end  the overall tone of the ES was strong  In terms of the days overall trade  total volume was higher  with 1 2 million futures contracts traded

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

144877,366392,STT,3 Passive Funds To Buy On Strong Inflows   Healthy Assets,opinion,Passive mutual funds in America created history by matching inflows with their active counterparts for the first time in five years  As a matter of fact  investors have more money parked in such funds compared to the actively managed ones This trend gathered steam in the fourth quarter of last year  Per Morningstar  passive mutual funds  exchange traded funds  ETFs  and smart beta funds together held  2 93 trillion in assets as of Dec 31  2018  In comparison  actively managed funds had  2 84 trillion of assets under management as of the last day of 2018 Steady Inflows in Passive FundsAs of Apr 30  2019  passive U S  equity funds had assets worth  4 3 trillion as per Morningstar estimates for U S  mutual fund and exchange traded fund flows for the first half  This is also the first time in the past five years that that passive equity funds have matched the inflows for their active counterparts Passive U S  equity funds received  39 3 billion in inflows for April compared with  22 2 billion in outflows for their active counterparts  Also  taxable bond funds witnessed a rise in demand  which is evident from  42 5 billion of inflows it received last month Moreover  among the 10 largest U S  fund families  iShares received the highest inflows with  8 billion  Inflows for State Street  NYSE STT  came in second at  7 5 billion  Morningstar also reported that among other major categories  only municipal bond funds saw inflows worth  7 1 billion  The other groups such as international equity funds witnessed  8 8 billion in outflows in the period Index Funds is the Way to GoThe primary reason behind investors rotating out of stocks to passive funds is that stocks that have higher prices struggled to beat market expectations lately  Such bearishness in equity markets can be countered by parking money into index tracking funds It is widely expected that inflows in passive funds which track U S  stocks of all sizes will surpass active funds by the end of 2019  For the record  only about 24  of all active funds could surpass passively managed ones over the past 10 years  After analyzing 4 600 mutual funds with around  12 8 trillion in assets  Morningstar concluded that in the long term horizon  foreign stock and bond funds were more successful compared with U S  large cap funds 3 Best ChoicesWe have  thus  selected three passive mutual funds with a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  that are poised to gain from such factors  Moreover  these funds have encouraging three and five year returns  Additionally  the minimum initial investment is within  5000 We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but also on the likely future success of the fund The question here is  why should investors consider mutual funds  Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds  read more    SEI S P 500 Index F  SIMT   fund invests 80  of its assets in securities of companies listed

144878,366393,STT,Nothing Has Changed  A Hard Brexit Is Coming  By Accident Or Design,opinion,"So  what has changed for U K  assets now that Theresa May has succumbed to the inevitable and announced her resignation as Prime Minister 
The pound s reaction   a pale  knee jerk bounce after a loss of nearly 4  in the last three weeks against the euro and dollar   gives the answer  not much 
The foreign exchange market s received wisdom since before the referendum has been that Brexit will do long term damage to the U K  economy and it has followed from there that sterling reacts negatively every time a Hard Brexit becomes more likely and rallies strongly any time the U K  looks like having second thoughts about the whole thing 
Right now  a Hard Brexit is looking more likely  As much as anything in politics is certain  May is certain to be replaced by a more ardent Brexiteer 
A YouGov poll last week showed ex Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was the preferred candidate of 39  of Conservative Party members  26 points ahead of former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab  But Johnson first has to convince Conservative lawmakers he can lead them  something they refused to do back in 2016 when his decision to back Brexit undercut then Prime Minister David Cameron 
 The modest support sterling and U K  rates have enjoyed since her announcement is somewhat remarkable   said Tim Graf  head of macro strategy EMEA at State Street  NYSE STT   State Street   We suspect that support will prove temporary  
Graf noted that parliament  has almost no options at its disposal to check any future Prime Minister who wants to leave the European Union without a deal    For an exhaustive analysis of why not  read this blog post from earlier this week by Maddy Thimont Jack  a senior researcher at the Institute for Government in London  
But if the new PM won t be constrained by procedure  he or she will be constrained by politics and economics  The opposition to No Deal from business  from sitting lawmakers and from the broader electorate is real  The Conservatives will have lost votes to pro Remain parties as well as Nigel Farage s Brexit party in this week s European elections  and the actual disruption from a Hard Brexit is something no Prime Minister will want to own 
Faced with that reality  the new leader will face the same choices  a  deliver Brexit with much economic pain  losing the next election b  abandon it at a cost of dividing the Conservative Party  losing the next general election or c  somehow kick the can further down the road  an option which by no means escapes the downside of options a  and b  
There are ways out 
The new Prime Minister could call yet another general election in pursuit of a clear mandate for No Deal  as May did in 2017  to disastrous effect   Another would be to call another referendum to  confirm  the popular will for No Deal  although that would inevitably divide both nation and party again  But both options could provide political cover  either pushing Brexit through or retreating from it 
Awkwardly  further dithering is not really an option either  Rem Korteweg  a policy analyst with the Clingendael think tank in the Netherlands  argues that the likelihood of continued paralysis in the U K  puts the country s fate back in the hands of the EU  The remaining 27 may be more inclined to listen to French President Emmanuel Macron the next time the U K  asks for more time to play politics with itself and to refuse any further extension of the deadline for Brexit 
At that point  a project that promised prosperity and freedom would finally have ended   as the currency market never fails to remind us   by leaving the U K  poorer and at the mercy of bigger trading blocs ",2019-05-24,Geoffrey Smith/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nothing-has-changed-a-hard-brexit-is-coming-by-accident-or-design-200424750,200424750

S P 500 Futures  Inverted Yield Curve And Global Rebalance Kill The Rally

During Monday nights Globex session  the S P 500 futures  ESM19 CME  printed a high of 2840 00  a low of 2822 00  and opened Tuesday s regular trading hours at 2830 75 
After a flat overnight trade  the ES saw some early strength after the 8 30 CT bell  and rallied up to a new high at 2841 25 in the first 15 minutes of trading  From there  the buying dried up  and over the next hour the futures slowly drifted down to 2825 25 
The ES went on to do a little back n fill up to 2833 75  then consolidated in a 9 handle range for the next 4 hours  before once again turning lower  this time setting its sights on the Globex lows 
By 2 30  the futures had broken through the Globex lows  and when the 2 45 cash imbalance reveal came out showing close to  2 billion to sell  it had traded all the way down to 2800 50  The ES closed on its lows  printing 2801 50 on the 3 00 cash close  and 2804 75 on the 3 15 futures close  down  27 handles on the day 
The markets were firm early  but as the day wore on  the ES got weaker  Why did the S P 500 futures selloff  Three reasons  1  The Russell 2000 was weak all day  2  The MSCI  96 billion dollar rebalance and   3  inverted bond yields  All three teamed up on the broader market

144880,366395,STT,5 Weekly Charts  Institutional Investor Confidence Plunges In Asia,opinion,"Here s some of the standout economic and markets charts on my radar  I aim to pick a good mix of charts covering key global macro trends  and ones which highlight risks and opportunities across asset classes 
1  Manufacturing PMIs    US Versus World  Well it s June already  and you know what that means    PMI time  The May round of PMI data showed the Global ex US manufacturing PMI drop deeper into contraction and the US swiftly catching down 
So  I guess now we have the answer as to whether the US can go it alone 
With the global growth scare still in full swing  it only adds to the case for a global policy pivot  and as discussed on Friday  it s already underway  

2  US Cyclicals Versus Defensives and the ISM   On the US  one direct implication of a weaker manufacturing PMI is that it puts cyclicals at risk of further downside  if the historical relationship in the chart below is anything to go by  
The problem with this is that cyclicals have been in the driving seat for US equities  so all else equal  it rarely is though  this arguably points to the possible further short term downside for equities 

3  The CMI    Credit Managers more optimistic   I like poking around in obscure and non mainstream datasets  and here s a good example  This chart shows the  Favorable Factors Index  of the NACM CMI  i e  the Credit Managers version of the PMI  
While it is indeed a volatile indicator  it s interesting to note the big jump in this index in May  and the contrast against the PMI above   Seems like credit managers are telling us things ain t as bad as some of the headline figures would make it seem  As usual with this sort of thing  we ll need to wait and see the June reading to know whether it s just a blip or a true nascent sign of resurgence 

4  Institutional Investor Confidence Plunges in Asia  This next one shows the State Street  NYSE STT  Investor Confidence Index for Asia  State Street builds these indexes off their giant global custodian business  and thus it is based on actual activity by asset managers and institutional investors   The key point is Asian investor confidence has plunged 
No doubt the trade war is a key source of concern  along with a softer global growth pulse   Usually  investor sentiment should be read as a contrarian indicator  but from first glance  these guys seem to have had some luck in buying the trough and selling the peaks  We ll soon find out if it s different this time   

5  Fed in Transition   Dollar in Transition  Last but certainly not least  the consensus is quickly shifting to expect Fed rate hikes  possibly as early as Q3 or early Q4  If you look at the PMIs I guess you can have some sympathy with that view 
Regardless  let s assume the Fed does pivot to cuts in the near term  History seems to show that eventually  rate cuts can help trigger off US dollar weakness  So maybe a 2019 Fed rate cut will spell the start of a US dollar bear market    that s not consensus ",2019-06-04,Callum Thomas,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-5-charts-of-the-week-global-pmis-us-cmi-asian-investors-and-the-fed-200428023,200428023
144887,366402,STT,Pound Volatility a Bargain for Investors Eyeing Brexit Breakout,news," Bloomberg     With the pound adrift in a directionless spot market bogged down by Brexit fatigue  strategists see opportunity in cheap volatility 
 State Street   NYSE STT  Bank   Trust is neutral on sterling but finds betting on swings over six months attractive  as that covers the Oct  31 deadline for the U K  to leave the European Union  Longer dated sterling volatility is  undervalued  for Adam Cole  chief currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada  given the persistent Brexit risks and domestic political uncertainty 
The British currency has been stuck mostly in a  1 29  1 31 range this quarter as cross party talks  aimed at finding common ground for an exit deal with the EU  have dragged on without result  U K  labor data could fuel some spot market action in the coming week  but a sustained move is seen as unlikely with the Bank of England expected to stay on hold until Brexit is resolved 
 The Easter break gave people a chance to take a break from Brexit and I think they re finding it hard to re engage  in the market  said Timothy Graf  head of EMEA macro strategy for Europe at State Street Bank   Trust   However  once you do get some meaningful news   the pound  would have that potential to jump 1  in your face and I don t think anyone can predict which direction   he said 
Contracts betting on implied volatility over six months have slid to 7 87   from 12 78  at the end of last year  even as speculation mounts that the U K  could see a second Brexit referendum or even an early election  One year volatility also touched its lowest since January 2018 last month 
RBC s Cole prefers the one year gauge  as  it s not hard to construct scenarios where cable trades back up to  1 50  or down to  1 10 and positioning for this in options is starting to look attractive  ",2019-05-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/pound-volatility-a-bargain-for-investors-eyeing-brexit-breakout-1865173,1865173

Bond yields across major developed markets have plunged this year as weak data  trade tensions and a dovish policy shift from major central banks boost demand for fixed income 
That trend has accelerated in May on signs of increasingly bitter trade tensions  heightened Brexit uncertainty and fears that Italy is set for another budget clash with Europe 
Of around the 7 69 trillion euros   8 57 trillion  of euro area government bonds in the Tradeweb system  the proportion of debt yielding less than zero rose to 3 71 trillion euros or 48  of the total in May  data from the trading platform as of the close of trade on Thursday showed 
It is up from 3 44 trillion euros or roughly 45  in April  It is the largest share since September 2016  a year when deflation risks and global growth worries last drove bond yields in the bloc deeply negative 
 Bond markets are telling you that disinflation is coming   said Tim Graf  chief macro strategist at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors in London 
 It speaks to a situation where markets are discounting more of a global slowdown than maybe we had previously thought   he said  referring to the deepening pool of negative yielding government debt

Friday s sharp drop in euro zone debt yields following U S  President Donald Trump s sudden threat to impose tariffs on Mexican goods    suggests the pool of government bonds carrying sub zero yields has only deepened 
Worldwide  analysts reckon more than  10 5 trillion in bonds now carry negative yields  That essentially means that in secondary bond markets  investors are willing to pay governments for holding their debt 
In Germany  the euro zone s biggest economy and its benchmark bond issuer  yields on 10 year government bonds fell to record lows at minus 0 21  
The yield on the triple A rated Dutch 10 year bond yield  teetering close to 0  for days now  turned negative for the first time since 2016  It was last trading down 3 basis points at minus 0 014  
Tradeweb data also showed almost 29  of euro zone government bonds    some 2 2 trillion euros worth    now yield less than the European Central Bank s deposit rate of minus 0 40 percent  the highest since December 2016  The proportion was 25  at the end of April 
 It is not a surprise that the pool of negative yielding bonds has risen   said Jan von Gerich  chief market strategist at Nordea   There is no sign of a bottoming out in yields yet  ",2019-05-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/almost-half-euro-government-bonds-now-yield-less-than-zero-percent-as-growth-gloom-deepens-1884130,1884130

seeking shelter from a Sino U S  trade war  Yet  money managers in Asia are pouring funds into Chinese stocks as the long term promise of a growing middle class trumps more immediate fears about tariffs   It is also a vote of confidence in Beijing s aggressive policy response to a festering Sino U S  trade standoff which has hurt its economy  unsettled world financial markets and triggered fears of a global recession  The anxiety has forced investors into defensive holdings such as the safe haven yen  gold and U S  Treasuries  Paradoxically  for China  the rising U S  import barriers have an upside as they inject impetus to the shift in its economy from an investment driven growth model towards one led by consumption and services  And  the nation s 400 million plus growing middle class provides a major attraction for fund managers   Owning domestic focused names in China has been successful in 2019  even with all the noise around trade tension  weakening macro and the magic  7

trade issues have not impacted them and their strong branding and high margins have attracted investors looking for less cyclical and global trade exposure   Duhra said  Domestic consumption already drives just over 75  of China s annual economic output   In an effort to revive its  14 trillion economy  China has pumped cash into banks  fast tracked infrastructure spending and rolled out tax cuts worth trillions of yuan to support consumers and businesses  And  it has said it could do more   Local governments have chipped in  Guangdong Province last month rolled out 29 measures to boost consumption  including relaxing restrictions on auto purchases   SAFE  BORING  DEFENSIVE Consumer shares have been relatively unscathed  even as escalating trade tensions wiped out 11  of the main

144916,366431,STT,5 Charts Highlight Global Economic Risks  Investor Pessimism,opinion,"Here s some of the standout economic and markets charts on my radar  originally posted on LinkedIn  I aim to pick a good mix of charts covering key global macro trends  and ones which highlight risks and opportunities across asset classes 
1  China vs USA Economic Pulse  This chart combines the official and Markit manufacturing PMIs for China and the US  With the latest results the standout is the slight rebound in China and drop in America 
But the bigger picture observations are 
China is below the critical 50 point mark  growth has clearly been softening there   and
The US has started to catch down to this softer growth impulse in China  and
It may well be that China has to recover first before the US will likewise regain momentum 
In other words  say what you will  but the economies of China and the USA remain intimately linked 

2  EM vs DM The Crossover  This one follows a similar vein  but bringing in the rest of DM where the slowdown has been much more accentuated  and the rest of EM where the slowdown has not been as distinct as in China 
If you can t see it  the February results have seen the composite emerging markets PMI break ever so slightly above the composite developed markets PMI 
This is a rare phenomenon which frankly usually only happens during a weak patch  at least in the post GFC world   But with EM central banks holding much more rate cut ammunition  and USD strength on the backburner  it could be a sign of things to come for EM  Certainly one to think about 

3  Futures Positioning A Compound Bet Unwinds  This chart got a lot of interest last year when a sort of  compound bet  emerged  Speculators were heavily long equities and heavily short bonds  if you think about the macro signal i e  equities tend to benefit from higher growth and inflation and bonds typically suffer in an environment of higher growth and inflation  it effectively amounted to an extreme in reflation optimism 
This compound bet has now unwound  which begs the question    if they were wrong on the optimistic side  will they be wrong in capitulating 

4  Global Investor Confidence Lagging Behind  The State Street investor confidence index  which is based on the buying selling activity of clients of the State Street  NYSE STT  global custodian business  remains in the doldrums  Judging by this and a few other surveys and anecdotes  institutional investors continue to run reduced risk asset exposure after notably de risking into the correction 
Basically what you might say is the dovish pivot by the Fed and slightly better sounding political noise  e g  trade deal promise  are clearly not enough to move the dial as concerns about US recession risk  and the slowdown in China Europe linger  and perhaps even a bit of GFC PTSD  

5  Twitter Survey  The last chart this week comes from the weekly survey I run on Twitter  In the survey I ask respondents to denote their equities view positioning  bullish or bearish  and the main reason  fundamentals vs technicals  
The chart shows the bulls vs bears spread for fundamentals and technicals    the basic takeaway is that investors are bearish on the fundamentals and  reluctantly  bullish on the technicals  But the other interesting thing in the results is there has been a persistent bearishness  with overall net bulls only being positive in 2 of the past 22 weeks since the correction began 
While this bearishness could turn out to be well justified  it makes it plain to see that the pain trade is for stocks to go higher ",2019-03-05,Callum Thomas,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-5-charts-of-the-week-global-economic-pulse-and-investor-sentiment-200394568,200394568

144918,366433,STT,Analysts Estimate State Street  STT  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects State Street  STT  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This holding company for State Street Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 23 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 91 billion  down 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 19  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street 
For State Street  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 34  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that State Street would post earnings of  1 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 68  delivering a surprise of  0 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
State Street doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-state-street-stt-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200407218,200407218

144930,366445,STT,Brexit stalls investments by sovereign wealth funds in Britain,news,By Tom Arnold LONDON  Reuters    Britain has long been a favored playground for sovereign wealth funds from around the world to snap up glitzy skyscrapers  banking stakes and posh department stores  However  uncertainty over Britain s tortuous exit from the European Union has put many new investments on ice  say sources close to the funds  Last year  there was a sharp drop in investments by wealth funds via private equity  with deals falling more than two thirds from 2017 to  3 82 billion  according to PitchBook  a data and research firm   A lot of funds are simply not pursuing deals  due to Brexit   while they wait for certainty   said Tihir Sarkar  London based partner at Cleary Gottlieb  which counts several prominent sovereign funds as clients   Brexit has now been postponed until Oct 31 so parliament can agree terms  While that prevents Britain from crashing out without a transition period in place  it also prolongs political and economic uncertainty  At least Britain managed to draw a vote of confidence in February when Norway s  1 trillion sovereign wealth fund  the world s biggest  said it planned to keep increasing UK investments  Most large sovereign funds contacted by Reuters did not respond or declined to provide comment  but several said their commitment to Britain remained unchanged while a couple acknowledged a pause in investments  Abu Dhabi s Mubadala Investment  which has its largest exposure to UK real estate and financial services and whose unit Masdar owns 20 percent of the London Array offshore wind farm  has not made any changes to its investment strategy or portfolio in anticipation of Brexit  spokesman Brian Lott said   Our long term strategy is opportunistic  so we will weigh the investment climate either way   he said  A spokesperson for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  which has investment portfolio assets estimated at  509 4 billion  said it was watching the Brexit situation and  keeps under constant review the need to adjust the Exchange Fund s investment strategies accordingly   But sources close to two other funds  who requested anonymity  said they were freezing investments until there was greater clarity on Brexit  British authorities may be getting concerned  two sources close to the sovereign fund industry said several funds had been asked by British officials  including ministers  for assurances they would remain committed to existing investments   LONG FAVORED  There are some bright spots   PitchBook data shows venture capital deal flow with sovereign fund participation in Britain rose 70 percent last year to  1 28 billion  And the pound s drop in value against the dollar since June 2016 appeared to have boosted allocations to external fund managers based in London  Sarkar said    We ve been really busy   he added   That s not small amounts  so  500 million   651 million  at a time  and those allocations have increased  since Brexit    Britain still ranks joint third along with India  for investments by sovereign wealth funds in 2017 and 2018  behind the United States and China  according to a report by Spain s IE University and ICEX  But it dropped out of the top five country destinations as a percentage of total deal volume in 2018  the report noted  Examples abound of the kind of uncertainties Brexit has created for sovereign funds  British holdings   China Investment Corp s 2017 acquisition of European warehouse firm Logicor was one such case  said Javier Capap   director of sovereign wealth research at IE University   Most of the warehouses are not in the UK but in the EU  bringing potential issues in the case of a hard Brexit   he said  noting also risks to businesses such as airports and financial services  where sovereign investors are heavily involved  London s Heathrow Airport is partly owned by Qatar Investment Authority  QIA  and China Investment Corp  while QIA and Singapore s Temasek Holdings own stakes in  Barclays   LON BARC  and  Standard Chartered   LON STAN   respectively  Brexit has contributed to hastening a shift away from real estate  traditionally a favored choice for investment in Britain  to technology   I see a structural shift as with real estate you re a little bit more exposed if you have a low growth UK which is the expectation with Brexit scenarios   said Elliot Hentov  head of policy and research at the official institutions group of  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors    But that won t affect your high value add technology and export sectors which will thrive regardless of Brexit  so you see a focus on sectors kind of independent of the uncertainty   QIA  one of the funds most active in Britain  particularly in real estate  is also diversifying its focus after amassing several London trophy assets  such as The Shard  Savoy and Connaught hotels and the high end Harrods store  It agreed to buy another hotel  the Grosvenor House  Reuters reported in November   We ve seen a decline  in British investment  in the past year or two  Real estate investment is definitely declining   said a source familiar with QIA s thinking  adding that it was looking more towards the Americas

144932,366447,STT,Forex   Dollar Holds Gains After Fed Signals Further Patience,news,"Investing com    The dollar was holding on to gains early Thursday in Europe after the Federal Reserve poured cold water on the idea of cutting interest rates any time soon 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at his regular press conference that Fed officials  don t see a strong case for moving in either direction   indicating that it believes the weakness of inflation and private demand in the first quarter will be temporary 
His comments  which pushed back against public lobbying for lower rates from President Donald Trump  triggered a sell off in U S  Treasuries and stocks and reversed more than one third of the dollar s slide over the previous three days 
At 03 00 AM ET  0700 GMT   the dollar index  which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies  was at 97 428  up nearly 0 5  from before Powell s comments 
The dollar s rebound was capped by more data suggesting patches of weakness in the economy  The Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index for April fell more than expected on Wednesday  while the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index had slumped on Tuesday  Balancing that  the Conference Board s consumer confidence index had risen more than expected 
 There remains a risk that a cut over the medium term may be necessary to support the economy  given a faster than anticipated dissipation in tax cut stimulus tailwinds   said Sophia Ferguson  senior portfolio manager at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors  adding that the market is  fair  to expect a 25 basis point cut some time this year  Even so  she acknowledged that  a significant downward revision to the economic forecasts is necessary to justify this course of travel  
The Fed is followed today by the Bank of England s Monetary Policy Committee meeting  While the the BoE is overwhelmingly expected to keep interest rates unchanged  analysts argue that its statement could be tilted to preparing markets for an interest rate hike later in the year  especially if the uncertainty over Brexit recedes 
In the short term  though  that uncertainty is still high  The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May is set for heavy defeats at local elections later today that will raise the pressure on her to abandon her strategy of seeking a cross party consensus on Brexit  most likely in the form of a customs union with the EU 
The pound hit its highest in nearly a month against the euro in early trade on the back of weaker than expected German retail sales data for March  A string of manufacturing and construction PMI reports in the course of the morning may change that

144940,366455,STT,Is SPDR S P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF  EDIV  A Strong ETF Right Now ,opinion,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Broad Emerging Market ETFs category of the market  the SPDR S P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF  NYSE EDIV  is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 02 23 2011 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market 
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency  market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns 
If you re the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection  then smart beta funds are your best choice  this fund class is known for tracking non cap weighted strategies 
Non cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  which is based on specific fundamental characteristics  or a mix of other such characteristics 
Methodologies like equal weighting  one of the simplest options out there  fundamental weighting  and volatility momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space  but not all of them can deliver superior returns 
Fund Sponsor   Index
EDIV is managed by State Street  NYSE STT  Global Advisors  and this fund has amassed over  535 83 M  which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Broad Emerging Market ETFs  Before fees and expenses  EDIV seeks to match the performance of the S P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index 
This Index generally includes 100 tradable  exchange listed common stocks from emerging market countries that offer high dividend yields  Additionally  stocks must have positive 3 year earnings growth and profitability  Stocks are weighted by annual dividend yield  To ensure diverse exposure  no single country or sector has more than a 25  weight and no single stock has more than a 3  weight 
Cost   Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF  and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 49   making it on par with most peer products in the space 
The fund has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 3 18  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk  investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund  Luckily  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
Looking at individual holdings  China Mobile Limited  941 HK  accounts for about 2 72  of total assets  followed by Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom  MCX GAZP  Sponsored Adr  OGZPY  and Ultrapar Participacoes S a   UGPA3 BR  
The top 10 holdings account for about 20 93  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
Year to date  the SPDR S P Emerging Markets  NYSE SPEM  Dividend ETF has added roughly 7 17  so far  and is down about  7 60  over the last 12 months  as of 01 30 2019   EDIV has traded between  27 94 and  36 54 in this past 52 week period 
The ETF has a beta of 0 83 and standard deviation of 18 24  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 139 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
SPDR S P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Emerging Market ETFs segment of the market  However  there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider 
IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  IEMG  tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF  VWO  tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China An Inclusion Index  IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has  55 91 B in assets  Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has  58 78 B  IEMG has an expense ratio of 0 14  and VWO charges 0 14  
Investors looking for cheaper and lower risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Emerging Market ETFs

Gold prices had surged in the fourth quarter of 2018  as investors sought safe assets amid rising stock market volatility  More recently  the decline in interest rates and softness of the US dollar  thanks to the Fed s change in tone on rates  have helped the precious metal 
According to the World Gold Council  growth in gold demand last year was also driven by highest central bank buying in 50 years 
Gold and other safe haven assets gain in an uncertain environment  And  there is no shortage of uncertainties this year   Will explains why he remains positive on gold 
We then discuss why gold deserves a place in investment portfolios and how much gold investors should investors own 
With an expense ratio of 17 49 basis points  the GraniteShares Gold Trust   TO BAR   is one of the cheapest gold ETFs on the market  Due to its low fee  BAR was able to pull in assets from other popular gold ETFs and reach over  450 million since its launch in August 2017 
 The largest gold ETF the SPDR Gold Shares   V GLD   charges 40 basis points  State Street  NYSE STT  recently launched a cheaper gold ETF the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust   V GLD   with an expense ratio of 18 basis points  The iShares Gold Trust   AX IAU   has an expense ratio of 25 basis points 
We discuss how fee wars in the gold ETF market have benefited investors 
Platinum  one of the rarest precious metals  is used mainly in automotive catalytic converters and jewelry  Historically  the metal generally traded at a premium to gold but it has been struggling for the past few years  Will explains why and whether this trend could be reversed 
GraniteShares Platinum Trust   BS PLTM   is the lowest cost  physically backed Platinum ETF on the market

S P 500 Futures   ES More Ups Than Downs
Remember when the Dow was dropping 600 to 800 points a day back in the last quarter of the 2018  Tech had soured  Europe was weak  the fed was pushing rates higher  and Trump was placing billions of dollar in tariffs on China  From its high the S P 500 futures dropped 20   Huge funds like State Street  NYSE STT  liquidated their holdings in FAANG  After several solid years of returns  investors were turning away from the market leaders in tech 
A few months after making its low  the S P 500 futures  ESH19 CME  have bounced all the way back to the 2780 s  Out of all the market moving news events  I believe the one thing that has had the biggest impact on the S P is the fed backing off on its rate hikes  Sure  a deal with China would be a big positive  but the feds move could signal a lot more upside   
During Thursday nights Globex session  the S P 500 futures  ESH19 CME  printed a high of 2757 00  a low of 2729 00  and rallied to open Friday s regular trading hours at 2765 00  The morning low print was 2763 00  and the morning high came in at 2773 00  The S P s traded 2768 00 on the 10 30 European close  and 2767 75 going into the noon hour 
The early afternoon saw a low of 2764 25  a high of 2772 00 and a print of 2771 25 going into the final hour of the day  The futures rallied into the close  and traded 2772 50 on the 2 45 cash imbalance reveal  then printed 2775 75 on the 3 00 cash close  and settled the day at 2777 00 on the 3 15 futures close  up  33 50 handles  or  1 22  
In the end  the overall tone of the ES was firm  In terms of the days overall trade  total volume was a little lower than Thursday  with 1 5 million futures contracts traded

144945,366460,STT,2 Best Index Funds To Invest In On Wall Street Optimism,opinion,"Trade tensions have finally begun to dissipate as the world s two largest economies edge closer to a trade deal  President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping s meet scheduled in March is also boosting investor optimism 
In such a scenario where markets are highly anticipated to witness a big rally and stocks could move higher on the prospect of a trade agreement  index funds could be your final stop for an ideal investment 
What is an Index Fund 
An index fund is a type of mutual fund that is designed to replicate a specific market index  The portfolio is constructed in a manner that the fund may track or match the components of the index  The fund aims to imitate the performance of the index through its investment strategy  
Since an index fund typically owns all the securities in a given index  maintaining the fund requires lesser effort  This makes these funds have lower fees than those that are actively managed  
Investing in an index fund can be deemed as a type of passive investment  which ensures the fund outperforms the majority of actively managed mutual funds  The fund s investment strategy can be termed passive because the fund owns a fixed portion of all the equities that comprise a given index in a bid to imitate its performance 
Why Invest in Index Funds Now 
It is imperative to invest in index funds now on the basis of a few developments on the geopolitical front that could boost the U S  stock market in the days to come  
The ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China has been one of the major market movers since it commenced in July  The trade talks appear to bear fruits lately as the United States postponed the implementation of an array of additional Chinese tariffs that were set to begin on March 1 and did not hint at a new deadline 
In addition  Trump s tweet earlier this week confirmed that trade talks were going significantly well  given he is scheduled to meet Chinese President Jinping next month to  conclude an agreement   Although disagreements still persist on the issue of intellectual property rights  China has already committed to purchase up to  1 2 trillion of American goods as part of the negotiations to end the dispute  a CNBC report cited 
Given that index funds typically replicate market indexes  investing in a few such funds that imitate the broader S P 500 could be ideal at present  Although the index has inched up 0 4  since the commencement of U S  China trade war on Jul 6  it has gained 11 5  on a year to date basis  reflecting the period the two nations declared a truce to begin negotiations  The S P 500 Index stands to gain significantly on the back of a trade deal in the near future  deeming index fund investments extremely lucrative 
2 Index Funds to Buy

The question here is  why should investors consider mutual funds  Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds  read more

144956,366471,STT,Beneath Fed s positive spin  an embrace of a tepid future,news,"By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider SAN FRANCISCO WASHINGTON  Reuters    Federal Reserve policymakers see a U S  economy that is rapidly losing momentum  They predict inflation will miss their 2 percent target for yet another year  despite rising wages  and they expect unemployment to increase  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell s view of it all  He calls these fundamentals  very strong   says the economy is in a  good place and sees the outlook as  favorable   Welcome to the new normal  Powell s upbeat assessment of a deteriorating economy shows how completely the Fed has embraced a world of stubbornly weak inflation  permanently slower growth and chronically low interest rates that give the central bank precious little room for conventional policy easing when the next downturn arrives  It is a situation that poses risks to the Fed s credibility  given the long running failure to lift inflation to a target first specified in 2012 in hopes of guiding the economy upward  It also raises the stakes over an evolving debate about the need for fiscal  social and other policies that may be targeted to pick up the slack   It feels like the Fed has come to Jesus on this topic   said University of Oregon economics professor Tim Duy  who believes the abrupt revisions to Fed forecasts show the Fed may have already raised interest rates too far   The secular stagnation story  some part of it  must in fact be a reality   Powell delivered his message on Wednesday as the Fed signaled it is likely finished with the interest rate increases it started back in 2015  and hinted that should the outlook worsen  a rate cut may be next    We are very mindful    of what the risks are   Powell said after the Fed held its target range for short term rates steady at 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent   We don t see data coming in that suggests we should move in either direction    We should remain patient and let the situation clarify over time  when the time comes  we will act appropriately   DOWN IN THE DUMPS  At least nine and perhaps as many as 15 of the Fed s 17 policymakers slashed their interest rate forecasts  with most seeing no rate hikes this year  As a group they now believe the economy has lost perhaps a third of its momentum compared with last year  and will grow around 2 1 percent in 2019   What about the idea they would need to boost rates high enough to brake growth and actually curb inflation  a feature of their outlook in 2018  A thing of the past  If anything  the Fed s concern has shifted in the other direction  toward inflation remaining so low it undermines business and household expectations about the future  another potential drag on growth if either sector becomes more cautious in spending  To some analysts  the abrupt revisions sound like a warning    What does the Fed know that it s not saying   asked Marvin Loh  global macro strategist at  State Street   NYSE STT    I think we are bracing for another shoe to drop   said Scott Anderson  chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco  That was also the view of financial markets  with short term interest rate futures quickly pricing in a rate cut next year   Powell noted risks to his positive outlook include a slowdown in Europe and ongoing trade tensions with China  RISK OF THE LESS LIKELY OUTCOME To others  however  it seemed like confirmation of an inconvenient truth  that global growth may have peaked  leaving countries stuck in slow growth mode and reliant on fiscal policy to keep from grinding to a halt  In addition  they will have to carry the load of recovery should a recession occur    Even once this episode is past  what do things look like  In the Fed s view it is a world of sub 2 percent growth  over the long run  said Nathan Sheets  chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former U S  Treasury official   By U S  historical standards  it is not great   Central banks in Japan and Europe are in a similar fix  fueling a global debate about whether  given chronically low interest rates  it makes sense for larger and economically more dynamic nations to borrow more for investments in infrastructure  education  climate adaptation and other endeavors that would have a clear public return    It is a different world   former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard said in a meeting with reporters recently at the Peterson Institute for International Economics   We are going to be in a world where monetary policy is highly constrained and fiscal  policy  will become central   Originally skeptical of the secular stagnation argument that low growth in developed nations is hardwired into the long term outlook by aging populations that over save  he said he now views that as the  more likely  state of affairs   The issue now is whether the current slow growth expansion will continue indefinitely in the hoped for  soft landing  that the Fed foresees in its current projections  There are arguments to the contrary  The recently released Economic Report of the President projected growth will remain near 3 percent this year and could edge up in coming years if  for example  the now temporary household tax cuts approved in 2017 are made permanent  Resolution of current global trade frictions could also raise the global outlook   But 2018  a year that began with U S  and world officials heralding an era of synchronized global growth  may also prove the outlier

144957,366472,STT,Dollar holds gains  sterling up on Brexit deadline extension,news,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO  Reuters    The dollar largely held onto the previous session s gains in early Asian trade on Friday  while sterling edged up on news that Britain could leave the European Union without a Brexit deal at a slightly later date 
Against a basket of key rival currencies  the dollar was about 0 1 percent lower at 96 394 
The index had recovered three quarters of a percent overnight after falling to a more than six week low on Wednesday on news the Federal Reserve had abandoned plans to raise rates this year 
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday welcomed the European Union s decision to delay Brexit  saying that lawmakers in the British parliament now had clear choices about what to do next 
Britain could leave the European Union without a Brexit deal on April 12 if lawmakers next week reject May s agreement with Brussels  EU leaders said on Thursday 
They also gave the British leader an extra two months  until May 22  to leave if she wins next week s vote in parliament 
Sterling rose one sixth of a percent to  1 3126  It had retraced sharp losses overnight  when it touched as low as  1 3004 
 Whenever we get news of the can being kicked down the road  the market reacts positively   said Bart Wakabayashi  Tokyo branch manager at  State Street   NYSE STT  Bank 
 Investors are probably shying away from exposure to the UK right now in terms of positioning   probably going back to benchmark exposures and wait and see mode   he said 
The Bank of England kept interest rates steady on Thursday and said most businesses felt as ready as they could be for a no deal Brexit 
Figures on Friday showed Japan s core consumer prices rose 0 7 percent in February from a year earlier  slowing from the previous month s pace 
The data underlines the fragile nature of Japan s economic recovery  as escalating U S  China trade frictions and slowing Chinese growth weigh on exports and business sentiment 
Against the Japanese yen  the dollar was a shade lower at 110 71 yen  staying well away from the 111 level last breached before the Fed s rate announcement 
Three in four Japanese companies expect U S  China trade frictions to last until at least late 2019  a sharp contrast to market hopes that presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping might soon strike a deal  a Reuters poll found 
The euro was a tad lower at  1 1370  extending losses into a second session after dipping one third of a percent overnight 

Data showing the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week had helped lift the dollar overnight ",2019-03-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/dollar-holds-gains-sterling-up-on-brexit-deadline-extension-1814934,1814934

144959,366474,STT,Compliance officers wary of switch to  Wild West  crypto sector,news,"By Anna Irrera and Tom Wilson NEW YORK LONDON  Reuters    After almost three decades in senior compliance roles at large financial firms including Bank of New York Mellon s Pershing and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   Jeff Horowitz made an unconventional career move  In July he became chief compliance officer at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase  taking a leap into the more lightly regulated world of digital assets   It s not for the faint of heart   Horowitz said of the move from compliance on Wall Street to a cryptocurrency startup   You need to have a flexible risk needle  The old school attitude of compliance being Doctor No really doesn t translate well to this industry   Horowitz is one of several senior compliance officers hired by cryptocurrency firms over the past year in a recruitment spree aimed at helping them cope with increased regulatory scrutiny and becoming more palatable to mainstream investors   The companies are especially keen to poach executives like Horowitz who have spent years in the legal and compliance divisions of large banks and law firms  But convincing them is not easy  say headhunters and recent hires  They tend to be risk averse and could be put off by the industry s libertarian founding ethos which can mean hostility toward government regulators   Digital currency trading has also faced a year long slump in volumes  making it harder for firms to attract candidates with promises of crypto riches  Annual salaries for senior positions in London are around 120 000 pounds   158 000  or more and in the United States around  300 000 or higher for larger companies  recruiters said   As these salaries are in line with the mainstream financial industry  recruiters pitch the chance to work in a fast moving and emerging industry    The best chief compliance officers have successfully mitigated risk for a living  and they tend to be relatively risk averse when thinking about their careers   said Scott Fletcher  a founder at fintech C suite recruitment firm Intersection Growth Partners   To find a person who has the skill set and is also willing to take the risk to join a cryptocurrency firm  it s tough   Carrying out checks on new clients  fielding requests for information from law enforcement  and figuring out what laws may apply to new financial assets   often across jurisdictions   are among the jobs that can be more challenging in a crypto firm   On boarding a new client you need to undertake careful due diligence   said Charles Beach of Lendingblock  a London based securities lending platform for cryptocurrencies   But you might not obtain the same level of assurance from a firm in the still very new crypto industry as you would from a mainstream financial firm   He previously worked in senior risk positions at trading firm IG Group  UBS and PwC   HACKING SCANDALS The crypto industry has been peppered by scandals including hacks  technology failings and alleged use of virtual coins for money laundering and on illegal online marketplaces   In September the New York Attorney General s Office said several cryptocurrency exchanges faced conflicts of interest  were vulnerable to market manipulation and put customer funds at risk   The same month  British lawmakers said the cryptocurrency market resembled  the Wild West  and should take steps to protect consumers and make it less vulnerable to hacking   Some cryptocurrency industry bodies  such as Britain s CryptoUK  have welcomed calls for regulation  urging a balance between rules to shield consumers and nurturing innovation  Others  like Global Digital Finance  have looked to establish industry wide international standards   Still  major lapses continue to happen   In January about  135 million in cryptocurrencies were frozen in the user accounts of Canadian exchange Quadriga after its founder  the only person with the password  died suddenly   In an affidavit filed on Quadriga s behalf  the founder s widow said she did not have the password to a  cold wallet  that held the cryptocurrencies on the founder s computer  A year earlier hackers stole cryptocurrency worth  530 million from Tokyo based exchange Coincheck  prompting an industry wide crackdown by Japan s financial watchdog  Coincheck eventually repaid affected investors some 46 billion yen   413 million  with its own funds  and was bought by online brokerage Monex Group Inc last April   MAJOR LEAGUE TO LITTLE LEAGUE  As regulators consider stricter new rules for exchanges or ramp up enforcement of existing ones  demand for experienced compliance professionals has grown   In the last 12 months we have seen somewhere near a 230 percent increase in volumes of compliance related jobs   said Zeth Couceiro  the founder of Plexus  a London based recruitment firm whose specialties include cryptocurrencies   Exchanges are also looking for employees who can help them adopt standards to appeal to more mainstream investors such as pension funds and asset managers  They have largely stayed clear of crypto  in part because of concerns about security breaches and a perception of lax internal controls    The people that can do that are the ones that have dealt with regulation for highly regulated institutions   said Josh Goodbody  who was hired as general counsel for global sales and institutional business at Singapore based exchange Huobi in June  Goodbody s experience includes roles at  State Street  Corp  NYSE STT  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Some executives who have made the switch say the industry s reputation still gives them pause  A chief compliance officer at a major Japanese exchange said founders of cryptocurrency companies often lack the experience and rigor needed to run a financial company

144974,366489,STT,Is SPDR S P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF  EDIV  A Strong ETF Right Now ,opinion,"The SPDR S P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF  NYSE EDIV  made its debut on 02 23 2011  and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Broad Emerging Market ETFs category of the market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes  which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole  have traditionally dominated the ETF industry 
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency 
If you re the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection  then smart beta funds are your best choice  this fund class is known for tracking non cap weighted strategies 
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  non cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such 
Methodologies like equal weighting  one of the simplest options out there  fundamental weighting  and volatility momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space  but not all of them can deliver superior returns 
Fund Sponsor   Index
Managed by State Street  NYSE STT  Global Advisors  EDIV has amassed assets over  403 25 M  making it one of the larger ETFs in the Broad Emerging Market ETFs  This particular fund  before fees and expenses  seeks to match the performance of the S P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index 
This Index generally includes 100 tradable  exchange listed common stocks from emerging market countries that offer high dividend yields  Additionally  stocks must have positive 3 year earnings growth and profitability  Stocks are weighted by annual dividend yield  To ensure diverse exposure  no single country or sector has more than a 25  weight and no single stock has more than a 3  weight 
Cost   Other Expenses
When considering an ETF s total return  expense ratios are an important factor  And  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal 
Annual operating expenses for EDIV are 0 49   which makes it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 3 51  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  a deep look into a fund s holdings is a valuable exercise  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
When you look at individual holdings  China Mobile Limited  941 HK  accounts for about 2 70  of the fund s total assets  followed by Ptt Global Chemical Plc Nvdr  PTTGC R TH  and Vodacom Group Limited  VOD ZA  
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 23 17  of EDIV s total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about  6 26  so far this year and was up about 0 01  in the last one year  as of 12 12 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  27 94 and  36 54 
EDIV has a beta of 0 94 and standard deviation of 18 77  for the trailing three year period  which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space  With about 134 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
SPDR S P Emerging Markets  NYSE SPEM  Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Emerging Market ETFs segment of the market  However  there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider 
IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  IEMG  tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF  VWO  tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China An Inclusion Index  IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has  49 14 B in assets  Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has  55 10 B  IEMG has an expense ratio of 0 14  and VWO charges 0 14  
Investors looking for cheaper and lower risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Emerging Market ETFs

144976,366491,STT,Earnings Preview  State Street  STT  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects State Street  STT  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This holding company for State Street Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 98 billion  up 4 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7 17  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street 
For State Street  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 88  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that State Street would post earnings of  1 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 87  delivering a surprise of  0 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
State Street doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-state-street-stt-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200374837,200374837

Stocks have rebounded this year after a brutal sell off in December but there are many uncertainties  What are the key themes investors should focus on 
Matthew recommends targeting quality over quantity of growth  among other strategies  Investors could consider the SPDR S P Dividend ETF   TO SDY   and the SPDR MSCI USA Strategic Factors ETF  
Value is another area investors could focus on  given rising concerns over growth stocks  valuations and peak earnings growth  Take a look at the SPDR Portfolio S P 500 Value ETF  
Technology stocks had led the rally for the past few years but they were hammered late last year on valuation  growth and regulatory concerns  Please listen to the podcast to find out why ETFs like the SPDR S P Internet ETF  and the SPDR S P Software   Services  NYSE XSW  ETF  look more attractive in the late cycle environment 
Health Care was one of the top performing sectors last year  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund  still looks attractive in the current market environment  in view of sector s high quality balance sheet and non cyclical growth

144991,366506,STT,Sterling soars after Brexit deal changes  yen dips as sentiment improves,news,"By Daniel Leussink TOKYO  Reuters    Sterling rallied on Tuesday on speculation that British Prime Minister Theresa May might be closer to securing approval for her Brexit deal after the European Commission agreed to some changes to it ahead of a vote in the British parliament  The pound jumped as high as  1 3290 as May won legally binding Brexit assurances from the European Union  in a last ditch attempt to sway rebellious British lawmakers who have threatened to vote down her divorce deal   The market was sensitive to positive news rather than negative news as it had already priced in very bad scenarios   said Masafumi Yamamoto  chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo  Yamamoto said the likelihood remained low that British lawmakers would now agree to May s deal in a vote expected later on Tuesday  just over two weeks before Britain s scheduled March 29 departure from the European Union  After paring some of its earlier gains  sterling was last trading half a percent higher on the day at  1 3214  It was still up 2 1 percent from a low of  1 2945 at one stage on Monday  The euro slipped to its lowest on the pound since May 2017 at 84 71 pence  before recovering the losses somewhat  It was last quoted down one third of a percent at 85 19 pence  Most other currencies stayed within familiar trading ranges before U S  February inflation figures due at 1230 GMT  Market sentiment received a modest boost after data on Monday showed U S  retail sales rose moderately in January  lifted by an increase in purchases of building materials and discretionary spending   The dollar index  which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals  was down 0 2 percent at 97 056 as some investors bought riskier assets  However  the dollar tacked on 0 2 percent against the Japanese yen to 111 41 yen on the back of the improved appetite for risk  If May loses the vote on her Brexit deal on Tuesday  she has said lawmakers will get a vote on Wednesday on whether to leave the EU without a deal and  if they reject that  then a vote on whether to ask for a limited delay to Brexit  At a joint news conference with E U  Commission head Jean Claude Juncker late on Monday  May announced three documents aimed at addressing the most contentious part of the exit deal she agreed in November   the Irish backstop   Seeing them together in the same screen is a positive   that there is some hand holding there and working together to move forward   said Bart Wakabayashi  Tokyo branch manager at  State Street   NYSE STT  Bank  The Irish backstop is an insurance policy aimed at avoiding controls on the sensitive border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland   If they can break  the backstop  down to a level where there can be some negotiation or at least compromise on both sides  there definitely does seem  to be  light at the end of the tunnel   added Wakabayashi  The euro  which has struggled recently in line with a sputtering euro zone economy  found a measure of support on the improved sentiment and the Brexit news

144992,366507,STT,Britain in Brexit chaos  parliament crushes May s EU deal again,news,"By Elizabeth Piper  Kylie MacLellan and William James LONDON  Reuters    British lawmakers crushed Prime Minister Theresa May s European Union divorce deal on Tuesday  thrusting Britain deeper into crisis and forcing parliament to decide within days whether to back a no deal Brexit or seek a last minute delay  Lawmakers voted against May s amended Brexit deal by 391 to 242 as her last minute talks with EU chiefs on Monday to assuage her critics  concerns ultimately proved fruitless  The vote puts the world s fifth largest economy in uncharted territory with no obvious way forward  exiting the EU without a deal  delaying the March 29 divorce date  a snap election or even another referendum are all now possible  May might even try a third time to get parliamentary support in the hope that hardline eurosceptic lawmakers in her Conservative Party  the most vocal critics of her withdrawal treaty  might change their minds if it becomes more likely that Britain might stay in the EU after all  While she lost  the margin of defeat was smaller than the record 230 vote loss her deal suffered in January  Lawmakers will now vote at 1900 GMT on Wednesday on whether Britain should quit the world s biggest trading bloc without a deal  a scenario that business leaders warn would bring chaos to markets and supply chains  and other critics say could cause shortages of food and medicines  May said the government would not instruct her own party s lawmakers how to vote  as would normally be the case  An opposition Labour Party spokesman said this meant she had  given up any pretence of leading the country   May s political spokesman said she had not discussed resigning  The prime minister  hoarse after Monday s late night talks  told lawmakers   Let me be clear  Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face   IMPASSE She said parliament was now at an impasse   Does it wish to revoke Article 50  announcing intention to leave the EU   Does it want to hold a second referendum  Or does it want to leave with a deal  but not this deal   Graham Brady  an influential Conservative lawmaker  said the two most likely scenarios were leaving the EU without a deal  or some kind of endless delay   Andrea Leadsom  who manages government business in parliament  insisted however that  it is still our intention  if at all possible  to leave the EU on March 29 with a good deal   The European Union said the risk of a damaging no deal Brexit has  increased significantly  but there would be no more negotiations with London on the divorce terms  Sterling  which had earlier in the day fallen by 2 percent to  1 3005  was trading at around  1 3086 shortly after the vote   GBP    One door has closed but other possibilities have opened up and markets are hopeful that Wednesday s vote on a no deal Brexit will suffer a big defeat   said Timothy Graf  head of macro strategy at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors in London  Opposition to May s deal among members of the Conservative Party derives from a belief that it does not offer the clean break from the European Union that many voted for  Supporters of Brexit argue that  while a  no deal  divorce might bring some short term instability  in the longer term it would allow the United Kingdom to thrive and forge beneficial trade deals across the world  However  parliament is expected firmly to reject a  no deal  Brexit as well  so lawmakers would then vote again on Thursday   on whether government should request a delay to the leaving date to allow further talks  Both May and the EU have already ruled out any other changes to the deal  struck after two and a half years of tortuous negotiations   NO THIRD CHANCE   There will be no third chance   European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said on Monday   There will be no further interpretations of the interpretations  no further assurances of the reassurances if the  meaningful vote  tomorrow fails   The government had been expected to offer parliament the chance to press for a short extension  but announced on Tuesday night that it would be for parliament to decide on the length of the delay that the government would request  This raised the possibility that it might ask to push the exit date past late May  when Britain would have to participate in European Parliament elections   a prospect that both sides have been keen to avoid  A spokesman for European Council President Donald Tusk  representing EU governments  said Britain would have to provide a  credible justification  for any request to delay Brexit   Britons voted by 52 48 percent in 2016 to leave the EU but the decision has not only divided the main parties but also exposed deep rifts in British society  bringing concerns about immigration and globalization to the fore  Many fear that Brexit will divide the West as it grapples with both the unconventional U S  presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China  leaving Britain economically weaker and with its security capabilities depleted   
Supporters say it allows Britain to control immigration and take advantage of global opportunities  striking new trade deals with the United States and others while still keeping close links to the EU  which  even without Britain  would be a single market of 440 million people ",2019-03-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/brexit-hangs-in-balance-as-lawmakers-to-vote-on-mays-tweaked-deal-1804505,1804505

Let s delve a little deeper and see which ETF areas raked in the maximum in the month and which ones lost the most    
S P 500 Rules
Despite crashes  the S P 500 based ETFs drew copious assets  iShares Core S P 500 ETF    topped the list with about  4 23 billion of monthly inflows  Another S P 500 based ETF Vanguard S P 500 ETF  garnered assets worth of  2 07 billion  However  SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY     AX SPY    lost about  4 97 billionprobably due to the fact it charges higher fees  0 09   than the other two  0 04   
Communication at a Sweet Spot

145002,366517,STT,State Street  STT  Down 10 1  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for State Street  STT   Shares have lost about 10 1  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is State Street due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  State Street Q3 Earnings   Revenues Miss  Expenses UpState Street s third quarter 2018 earnings of  1 87 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Nonetheless  the figure was 13  above the prior year quarter level Results reflected higher net interest income  reflecting rise in interest rates  and fee income  indicating higher trading services income and management fees   which supported revenue growth  Also  improvement in assets under custody and administration  and AUM acted as a tailwind  However  increase in non interest expenses was an undermining factor Net income available to common shareholders was  709 million  up 12 7  from the year ago quarter s figure Revenues Improve  Expenses RiseTotal revenues were  2 95 billion  increasing 3 7  from the year earlier quarter s count  However  the top line marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 billion Net interest revenues increased 11 4  from the year ago quarter to  672 million  This upside was mainly driven by higher interest rates and an increased client engagement across cash products and a disciplined liability pricing  Also  net interest margin expanded 13 basis points year over year to 1 48  Fee revenues inched up 1 7  from the prior year quarter to  2 28 billion  This uptick was aided by higher management fees and trading services revenues  partially offset by a decline in servicing fees  securities finance revenues and processing fees plus other revenues Non interest expenses were  2 08 billion  up 2 9  on a year over year basis  The rise was due to increase in all expense components except occupancy costs As of Sep 30  2018  total assets under custody and administration were  34 trillion  up 5 9  year over year  Moreover  AUM was  2 8 trillion  up 5 1  Strong Capital and Profitability RatiosUnder Basel III  Advanced approach   estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 14 0  as of Sep 30  2018  up from 12 4  as of Jun 30  2018 Return on common equity came in at 14 0  compared with 13 0  in the year ago quarter State Street BeaconGiven the continued challenging environment  State Street is accelerating its multi year plan to further digitize its operating environment and create cost efficiencies  The company announced a multi year plan to accelerate the next phase of its transformation program aimed at generating roughly  550 million in annualized pre tax savings and improve operating basis pre tax profit margin to 33   Notably  the company is on track to complete the initiative by early 2019  significantly ahead of scheduled target of 2020 end State Street generated  180 million   150 million and  175 million in pre tax expense savings in first nine months of 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively  The company now targets to achieve  200 million in annual pre tax net run rate expense savings in 2018  up from prior target of  150 million  Also  the company reached its operating basis pre tax profit margin target of 31  in 2017  ahead of scheduled 2018 end   In order to implement State Street Beacon  the company anticipates incurring aggregate pre tax restructuring costs of approximately  300  400 million Outlook  excludes any contribution from acquisition of Charles River Development 2018State Street will be providing financials primarily on GAAP basis this year  while presenting certain non GAAP measures such as pre tax margin as well as additional notable items including acquisition restructuring costs in line with industry practice Starting 2018  on a perspective basis  the new FASI revenue recognition standard takes effect  under which certain costs previously presented on a net basis will now be represented on a gross basis  Hence  management expects revenues and expenses to increase nearly  225 million NII is anticipated to grow within a range of 10  to 13   reflecting higher expected interest rates  Further  balance sheet growth will mainly depend on new business and related client deposit activity Management expects fee revenues to rise in the range of 7 8   attributable to decent equity market growth and continued low volatility trading divisions The company anticipates swap cost to moderate following the changes in the currency mix of balance sheet  Hence  processing fees and other revenues will be in the range of  35  45 million on a quarterly basis Further  the company projects positive fee operating leverage in the 75 to 150 basis points range and reflects focus on both investments and expense management  Management expects to see variability across quarters  with continued focus on expense management In addition  on a GAAP basis effective tax rate is estimated to be in the 15 17  range Fourth Quarter 2018 OutlookWe expect fourth quarter 2018 servicing fee revenues to be flat sequentially on the assumptions of continuing industry conditions and stable market levels  Further  sequential NII growth is projected  though it always depends on market rates and betas Total expenses are anticipated to be marginally above third quarter levels  Notably  this is consistent with the company s expectations to keep second half 2018 expenses flat compared to the first half

145003,366518,STT,Is SPDR S P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF  EDIV  A Hot ETF Right Now ,opinion,"Making its debut on 02 23 2011  smart beta exchange traded fund SPDR S P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF  NYSE EDIV  provides investors broad exposure to the Broad Emerging Market ETFs category of the market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes  which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole  have traditionally dominated the ETF industry 
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency 
There are some investors  though  who think it s possible to beat the market with great stock selection  this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta  which track non cap weighted strategies 
Based on specific fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such  these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance 
Methodologies like equal weighting  one of the simplest options out there  fundamental weighting  and volatility momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space  but not all of them can deliver superior returns 
Fund Sponsor   Index
The fund is managed by State Street  NYSE STT  Global Advisors  and has been able to amass over  390 25 M  which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Broad Emerging Market ETFs  EDIV  before fees and expenses  seeks to match the performance of the S P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index 
This Index generally includes 100 tradable  exchange listed common stocks from emerging market countries that offer high dividend yields  Additionally  stocks must have positive 3 year earnings growth and profitability  Stocks are weighted by annual dividend yield  To ensure diverse exposure  no single country or sector has more than a 25  weight and no single stock has more than a 3  weight

145020,366535,STT,Investors Hedge a Stock Doomsday With Record Fixed Income Inflows,news," Bloomberg     Investors are amassing an expensive insurance policy against market doomsday 
Confident that fragile economies will keep monetary policy makers in dovish straight jackets  they poured another  490 million into the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  ETF last week    bringing its year to date inflow to a record  2 3 billion 
That stocks will suffer as a result of this brittle growth outlook has also helped push three month trailing inflows into fixed income ETFs to the highest on record through end January  according to  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors 
 Fears of worsening economic momentum coupled with geopolitical uncertainties and corporate earnings revisions that appear to have limited upside has triggered a rush for safety   said Antoine Lesne  head of SPDR ETF Strategy   Research for Europe at State Street Global Advisors   Fixed income is thus a good place to be relative to higher potential drawdowns in equity portfolio  
After climbing up along with stocks  Treasury yields reversed course mid January  signalling the bond market is prepping for slower growth and inflation 
A rally in German bonds pushed benchmark 10 year yields below 0 1 percent Monday morning to a two year low on the heels of dimming economic projections 
Investors have added  18 4 billion into U S  listed fixed income funds this year  nearly as much as they ve pulled from equity funds     18 9 billion    according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Though some of those outflows may be down to tax loss harvesting  it s the most lopsided relationship between the two asset classes since 2016 
Bonds aren t rejecting risk altogether  of course  Strong inflows into U S  high yield credit persist  even though high corporate debt loads look vulnerable in an economic slowdown ",2019-02-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investors-hedge-a-stock-doomsday-with-record-fixedincome-inflows-1776197,1776197

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is STT due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers State Street Beats on Q1 Earnings as Revenues ImproveState Street s first quarter 2018 earnings of  1 62 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 58  Also  it was 40 9  above the prior year quarter Higher net interest income  reflecting rise in interest rates  and fee income  indicating higher trading services income  supported top line growth  Also  improvement in assets under custody and administration and assets under management  AUM  acted as a tailwind  However  increase in non interest expenses was an undermining factor Net income available to common shareholders came in at  605 million  up 35 7  from the year ago quarter Revenues Improve  Expenses RiseTotal revenues were  3 02 billion  increasing 13 2  from the prior year quarter  Further  the top line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate Net interest revenues jumped 29  from the year ago quarter to  658 million  The rise was mainly driven by higher interest rates  loan growth and increase in client balances  Also  net interest margin increased 26 basis points year over year to 1 43  Fee revenues grew 7 5  from the prior year quarter to  2 37 billion  All components of fee income showed improvement except processing fees and other revenues During the reported quarter  new asset servicing mandates totaled  1 3 trillion Non interest expenses were  2 26 billion  up 8 1  on a year over year basis  The rise was due to increase in other expense components As of Mar 31  2018  total assets under custody and administration were  33 3 trillion  up 11 6  year over year  Moreover  AUM was  2 7 trillion  up 6 6  Strong Capital and Profitability RatiosUnder Basel III  Advanced approach   estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 12 1  as of Mar 31  2018  up from 12 0  as of Dec 31  2017 Return on common equity came in at 12 8  compared with 9 9  in the year ago quarter Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter  State Street repurchased shares worth  350 million  This was part of the company s 2017 capital plan State Street BeaconGiven the continued challenging environment  State Street is accelerating its multi year plan to further digitize its operating environment and create cost efficiencies  The company announced a multi year plan to accelerate the next phase of its transformation program aimed at generating roughly  550 million in annualized pre tax savings  from the prior target date of 2020 end  and improve operating basis pre tax profit margin to 33  by 2020 Moreover  State Street generated  58 million   150 million and  175 million in pre tax expense savings in first quarter 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively  The company now targets to achieve  150 million in annual pre tax net run rate expense savings in 2018  Also  the company reached its operating basis pre tax profit margin target of 31  in 2017  ahead of scheduled 2018 end  In order to implement State Street Beacon  the company anticipates incurring aggregate pre tax restructuring costs of approximately  300  400 million Outlook2018 State Street will be providing financials primarily on GAAP basis this year  while presenting certain non GAAP measures such as pre tax margin as well as additional notable items including acquisition restructuring costs in line with industry practice Starting 2018 on a perspective basis  the new FASI revenue recognition standard takes effect  under which certain costs previously presented on a net basis will now be represented on a gross basis  Hence  management expects revenues and expenses to increase nearly  225 million Considering the gains on sale  management expects fee revenues to rise in the range of 7 8   attributable to decent equity market growth and continued low volatility trading divisions The company anticipates swap cost to moderate as following the changes in the currency mix of balance sheet  Therefore  processing fees and other revenue will be in the range of  35 45 million on a quarterly basis Further  the company projects positive fee operating leverage in the 75 to 150 basis points range and reflects focus on both investments and expense management  Management expects to see variability across quarters  with continued focus on expense management NII is anticipated to grow within a range of 10  to 13   reflecting higher expected interest rates  Further  balance sheet growth will mainly depend on new business and related client deposit activity In addition  on a GAAP basis effective tax rate is estimated to be in the 15 17  range Second Quarter 2018The company expects momentum in NII growth to continue  driven by higher rates Management expects securities finance  which includes the agency and enhanced custody businesses  to witness seasonal uptick sequentially  albeit at muted levels compared with the year ago quarter

In other political news  the partial U S  government shutdown   the longest in history   has extended into its 27th day  as a standoff between Democrats and the Trump administration over the president s border wall money shows no signs of being resolved any time soon 
Despite the political turmoil  global stocks have largely weathered the storm  as traders took solace in dovish comments made by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  who made the case for patience and caution on interest rate hikes in a speech earlier this month 
While the Fed s forecasts indicate two more rate hikes in 2019  traders of contracts tied to the central bank s policy are betting that the U S  central bank will not deliver a single rate hike this year 
 There s a lot of speculation that we ve seen the end to the rate hike cycle and many people are even talking about rate cuts this year   said Bart Wakabayashi  Tokyo branch manager at  State Street   NYSE STT  Bank

Gilead s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biotech industry in the last six months  increasing  6 1  vs  a decline of  4 6   Gilead topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter  
The HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens in the United States and EU  The TAF based regimens now represent 62  of total HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy in 2016  
The Zacks analyst thinks that the approval of Gilead s latest triple HIV therapy is likely to provide an impetus to the stock as Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR T therapy  However  the HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition  
Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid 2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further  The company s guidance for 2018 also lacks luster

Shares of BNY Mellon have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last six months   11 3  vs   21 6    The company s earnings surpassed expectations in only two of the trailing four quarters  Concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee based income remains a matter of concern for the company  
If there are any changes in individual investment preferences  regulatory amendments or a slowdown in capital market activities  it could hurt the company s financials  However  The Zacks analyst thinks easing margin pressure  driven by gradual higher interest rates  and rising loan demand will drive revenue growth  Also  potential lesser regulations  lower tax rates and cost saving initiatives are likely to drive profitability

State Street s shares have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last six months   16 5  vs   21 6    The company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  
The Zacks analyst likes its new business wins  synergies from GE Asset Management deal and rising interest rates  all of which are likely to continue supporting profitability  Further  the company s cost saving efforts through multi year restructuring plan is expected to a success  
However  continuous decline in trading services revenues is a concern  Also  mounting expenses remain a major near term concern for the company

145051,366566,STT,How To Avoid the Worst Style ETFs 1Q18,opinion,"Question  Why are there so many ETFs 

Answer  ETF providers tend to make lots of money on each ETF so they create more products to sell 

The large number of ETFs has little to do with serving your best interests  Below are three red flags you can use to avoid the worst ETFs 

 Inadequate Liquidity

This issue is the easiest issue to avoid  and our advice is simple  Avoid all ETFs with less than  100 million in assets  Low levels of liquidity can lead to a discrepancy between the price of the ETF and the underlying value of the securities it holds  Plus  low asset levels tend to mean lower volume in the ETF and larger bid ask spreads 

 High Fees

ETFs should be cheap  but not all of them are  The first step here is to know what is cheap and expensive 

To ensure you are paying at or below average fees  invest only in ETFs with  below 0 46   which is the average total annual cost of the 446 U S  equity Style ETFs we cover  The weighted average is lower at 0 15   which highlights how investors tend to put their  

Figure 1 shows Forensic Accounting  NYSE FLAG  is the most expensive style ETF and Schwab US Large Cap  NYSE SCHX  is the least expensive  Direxion Daily Aerospace   Defense Bull 3X Shares  NYSE DFEN  provide two of the most expensive ETFs while Schwab US Large Cap  NYSE SCHX  and State Street Corporation  NYSE STT  ETFs are among the cheapest 

Figure 1  5 Most and Least Expensive Style ETFs



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

Investors need not pay high fees for quality holdings  Schwab U S  Large Cap ETF  SCHX  is the best ranked style ETF in Figure 1  SCHX s Neutral  and 0 03  total annual cost earns it a Very Attractive rating  ValueShares US Quantitative Value  NYSE QVAL  is the best ranked style ETF overall  QVAL s Attractive Portfolio Management rating and 0 88  total annual cost also earns it a Very Attractive rating 

On the other hand  State Street SPDR Portfolio S P 500 Value ETF holds poor stocks and earns our Neutral rating  yet has low total annual costs of 0 04   No matter how cheap an ETF  if it holds bad stocks  its performance will be bad  The quality of an ETFs holdings matters more than its price 

 Poor Holdings

Avoiding poor holdings is by far the hardest part of avoid bad ETFs  but it is also the most important because an ETFs performance is determined more by its holdings than its costs  Figure 2 shows the ETFs within each style with the worst holdings or

ProShares Ultra Oil   Gas  DIG  is the worst rated ETF in Figure 2 and earns a Very Unattractive rating  Guggenheim Raymond James SB 1 Equity ETF  RYJ   Vanguard Mid Cap Growth Index  VOT   iShares Morningstar Small Cap Growth  JKK   PowerShares Russell 2000 Equal Weight Portfolio  EQWS   and Guggenheim Invest S P MidCap 400 Pure Value  NYSE RFV  earn an Unattractive   which means not only do they hold poor stocks  they charge high total annual costs

The Danger Within

Buying an ETF without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances  Put another way  research on ETF holdings is necessary due diligence because an ETF s performance is only as good as its holdings  performance  Don t just take our word for it   on this matter

145055,366570,STT,China Dollar Bonds Face Higher Bar in U S  ,news," Bloomberg     China s offshore bond issuers have increasingly veered away from selling in the U S  in recent years  thanks to a deepening pool of dollar liquidity back home in Asia  The trade war is now making Chinese borrowers all the rarer in America 
When Industrial   Commercial Bank of China Ltd   China s biggest bank  canceled an offering of dollar bonds in the U S  market last week  it showcased how much more difficult conditions now are for the country s issuers 
 The trade war overhang is clearly becoming a further challenge for Chinese issuers in building up the trust and confidence of the U S  investor base   said Jim Veneau  the Hong Kong based Asia head of fixed income at AXA Investment Managers Asia Ltd 
So far this year  Chinese borrowers have sold about  10 billion of securities targeted for U S  based investors  which require greater regulatory compliance than those issued outside the country  That s down from  33 billion during the same period four years ago  Chinese issuers in total sold  148 billion of dollar bonds so far this year  up from  86 billion in 2014 
ICBC s surprise cancellation came weeks after a sovereign offering of Chinese bonds saw diminished American demand as trade tensions escalated 
Here are some further perspectives on the prospects for Chinese dollar bond sales in the U S 
 Huge  Uncertainty
Mark Konyn  chief investment officer at AIA Group 

 It tells you a lot about current liquidity conditions and where investors are in terms of risk perceptions of China in the current environment   he said 
 There s a huge amount of uncertainty around the full effects of the trade standoff and who it affects  

Tilt to Asia
Alan Roch  head of Asia bond syndicate at  Standard Chartered   LON STAN  Plc 

 The core investor base of China dollar deals is more so than ever in Asia  
 With the investor base continuing to grow in our region we expect that trend to continue  and therefore the share of deals marketed in 144 format to reduce   he said  referring to so called 144A sales that are targeted to the U S 
 One size never fits all though  and for some issuers and industries  onshore U S  demand will remain important  

 Rare  Issuers
Veneau at AXA 

 The general U S  investor premise on China  in particular the offshore dollar market  is that there is a lack of transparency  lower corporate governance standards and a structural weakness to offshore issues  
 That s a tough hurdle for individual issuers to overcome  no matter how strong they may be  
 It s the rare Chinese issuer that has achieved a level of comfort and trust from U S  investors    an issuer like ICBC would ordinarily be in that group of issuers  

 Little Incentive 
Raymond Chia  head of credit research for Asia excluding Japan at Schroder Investment Management Ltd 

 Basically they have little incentive to add China risks   he said of U S  investors 
 Overall market sentiment towards China  has been  weak despite a series of easing measures by Beijing  
 Supply from Chinese financials is always there and China property names keep coming as well    so there s supply risk against a challenging market backdrop  

Higher Costs
Ng Kheng Siang  Asia Pacific head of fixed income at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors 

 Growing Sino U S  trade tension  uncertainty of such impact on economic activities  a lower Chinese growth outlook and other factors may affect investors  appetite and spreads for Chinese issuers  
 Issuers are faced with a difficult choice of higher funding cost both offshore and onshore  
 Some may just have to bite the bullet to raise funds at higher costs if they need this as new working capital and roll over existing liabilities due to mature

The Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed could tighten monetary policy at a slower pace than expected 
The news came after Fed chairman Jerome Powell delivered a bullish assessment of the U S  economy on Thursday 
 Our economy is currently performing very well overall  with strong job creation and gradually rising wages    said Powell in his final scheduled public remarks before the central bank goes into a blackout period before its Dec  18 19 policy meeting   In fact  by many national level measures  our labour market is very strong   
The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its Dec  18 19 meeting  which would be its fourth hike this year  However  traders have reportedly reduced their bets on 2019 rate increases amid stock market losses and worries over an escalating trade war between the U S  and China 
 We ve already heard from  Fed Chairman Jerome  Powell that he thinks the neutral rate has moved quite far in quite a short period of time   said Bart Wakabayashi  Tokyo branch manager at  State Street   NYSE STT  Bank

145064,366579,STT,After dire 2018  chastened funds tout emerging FX again,news,By Tommy Wilkes and Karin Strohecker LONDON  Reuters    Emerging market currencies have had one of their worst years in a decade  but bruised investors tempted by what they see as cheap valuations are hoping the U S  dollar s eight month resurgence will end and the world won t tip into recession  Emerging markets were touted by some of the biggest asset managers as one of the investment plays of 2018  But despite a rebound in November  emerging equities  bonds and currencies are in fact down sharply this year  Defying predictions for a mid year recovery  MSCI s emerging market currency index is down 4 5 percent in 2018  and 7 5 percent from the March peak  MIEM00000CUS   And that assumes you spread the risk  avoiding the howling year to date losses of 30 percent in Turkey s lira   50 percent in Argentina s peso  or even 13 15 percent in Russia s rouble  RUB    Brazil s real  and South Africa s rand   MSCI s emerging equity index  MSCIEF  is down nearly 16 percent  So what has changed to encourage another bout of optimism  Last month  emerging currencies and stocks staged their best performance since January while investors pumped in  34 billion  the most in 10 months  Institute of International Finance data showed  December is proving less rosy  but the main catalyst for the tentative bounce is a repricing of Federal Reserve policy  Fed watchers mostly see the central bank raising interest rates once in 2019  instead of previous expectations of three times  The resulting dollar decline has eased pressure on countries with hard currency debt   Investors also say the panic in August and September might have been overdone  Since then  central bank action in the hardest hit markets has restored some confidence   A lot of these emerging market currencies have discounted a lot of bad news quite significantly   said Tony Finding  portfolio manager at M G Investments   EM currencies against the dollar    One big difference from previous selloffs such as the 1997 financial crisis is that developing countries have smaller proportions of their debt in dollars  Foreign currency denominated debt stands at 14 percent of GDP versus 17 percent in 1999  This leaves them slightly less vulnerable when U S  interest rates and the dollar rise  Also  unlike in 1997  most emerging market countries freely float their currencies  Flexible exchange rates can absorb pain from slower economic growth and external shocks faster and support recoveries  although this feeds higher inflation  Repeated interest rate hikes in the likes of Turkey  Indonesia and Mexico have helped reassure markets that central banks retain some policy independence after concerns about increasing political control over their coffers   These rate rises have translated into hefty inflation adjusted  or  real   bond yields   Bob Michele  CIO for fixed income at JP Morgan Asset Management  said emerging 10 year real yields averaged around 4 5 percent versus zero in developed markets   So the real yield differential is very  very high   he said   Finding of M G has been buying Turkish bonds  reckoning the economy s worst travails are over  Data on Tuesday appeared to support him  Ankara s current account was in surplus for a third month after years of deficit  UNDERVALUED  From 16 month lows in September  emerging currencies have rebounded close to 2 percent  According to a commonly used measure of a currency s value   the real effective exchange rate  REER    currencies outside Asia are undervalued  REER measures the inflation adjusted value of a currency against its trading partners  Investors compare current values with long term averages  typically over 10 years  The expectation is prices eventually return to those equilibriums  although many are skeptical about REER s predictive ability   REER indicates Turkey s lira is 22 percent undervalued versus 10 year averages and Brazil s real nearly 19 percent so  while Mexico s peso and Russia s rouble are both around 15 percent undervalued  Emerging markets real effective exchange rates    Undervaluation could help lift emerging currencies 5 8 percent over 12 months  said Ben Jones  strategist at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors   PROVE IT  Emerging assets have proved more

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is STT due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers State Street Q4 Earnings Improves as Revenues Rise  Costs UpState Street s fourth quarter 2017 operating earnings of  1 83 per share increased 23 6  year over year  The figure excluded one time net costs of  270 million or 72 cents per share related to the tax reform and other significant non recurring items Moreover  GAAP earnings excluding one time tax charges were  1 61 per share  up 23 8  from the prior year quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was  1 71 Higher net interest income  reflecting rise in interest rates   fee income and a decline in operating expenses supported the results  Also  improvement in assets under custody and administration and assets under management  AUM  acted as a tailwind  However  lower trading servicing fees was an undermining factor After considering several notable items  net income available to common shareholders came in at  334 million or 89

year quarter  However  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 98 billion Net interest revenues  on an operating basis  jumped 20 3  from the year ago quarter to  658 million  The rise was mainly driven by higher interest rates  loan growth and disciplined liability pricing  Also  net interest margin increased 31 basis points year over year to 1 38  Fee revenues grew 5 7  from the prior year quarter to  2 33 billion  All components of fee income showed improvement except total trading services revenues On an operating basis  non interest expenses were  2 billion  down 6 8  on a year over year basis  The fall was due to lower other costs and compensation and employee benefits expenses As of Dec 31  2017  total assets under custody and administration were  33 1 trillion  up 15 1  year over year  Moreover  AUM was  2 8 trillion  up 12 7  year over year Strong Capital and Profitability RatiosUnder Basel III  Advanced approach   estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 12 3  as of

challenging environment  State Street is accelerating its multi year plan to further digitize its operating environment and create cost efficiencies  The company announced a multi year plan to accelerate the next phase of its transformation program aimed at generating roughly  550 million in annualized pre tax savings  from the prior target date of 2020 end  and improve operating basis pre tax profit margin to 33  by 2020 Moreover  State Street generated  175 million and  150 million in annual pre tax expense savings in 2016 and 2017  respectively  The company now targets to achieve  150 million in annual pre tax net run rate expense savings in 2018  Also  the company reached its operating basis pre tax profit margin target of 31  in 2017  ahead of scheduled 2018 end  In order to implement State Street Beacon  the company anticipates incurring aggregate pre tax restructuring costs of approximately  300  400 million Outlook2018 State Street will be providing financials primarily on GAAP basis this year  while presenting certain non GAAP measures such as pre tax margin as well as additional notable items including acquisition restructuring costs in line with industry practice Starting 2018 on a perspective basis  the new FASI revenue recognition standard takes effect  under which certain costs previously presented on a net basis will now be represented on a gross basis  Hence  management expects revenues and expenses to increase nearly  225 million Considering the gains on sale  management expects fee revenues to rise in the range of 7 8   attributable to decent equity market growth and continued low volatility trading divisions Further  the company projects positive fee operating leverage in the 75 to 150 basis points range and reflects focus on both investments and expense management  Management expects to see variability across quarters  with continued focus on expense management NII is anticipated to grow within a range of 10  to 13   reflecting higher expected interest rates  Further  balance sheet growth will mainly depend on new business and related client deposit activity In addition  on a GAAP basis effective tax rate is estimated to be in the 15 17  range First Quarter 2018Management expects first quarter 2018 guidance to be relatively in line with full year outlook Notably  compensation benefit expense will be seasonally higher in the quarter due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement eligible employees as well as payroll taxes

While U S  stocks could be in for a choppy ride during the rest of 2018 as liquidity is unlikely to improve  most of the price damage is done for now  according to  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  strategist Michael Wilson 
 We see the need for some healing and the Rolling Bear turning into a Chopping Bear as investors try to figure out what will lead during a time of year when short term performance pressure may exert more influence than normal   Wilson wrote in a note Monday 
Wilson has deployed  rolling bear  for months to capture the idea that markets would be hit by a series of blows affecting different sectors at different times  as the Federal Reserve s tightening and a less synchronized global economic expansion weighed on equities

Shrinking liquidity from the Fed s quantitative tightening  and now the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan tapering quantitative easing purchases  has been a focus all year  Wilson wrote  It reached a  tipping point  early last month and was likely the primary catalyst for stocks  worst month since the 2011 12 equity bear market  he added 
 The good news is that global asset prices now reflect this risk   Wilson wrote   The bad news is that the growth in global central bank balance sheets is set to decelerate and go negative by January  We think this will accentuate the choppiness and make it difficult to trade  
Wilson also highlighted the changing fortunes of value and growth stocks

 We have had a preference for value over growth since late July  October s relative outperformance in a down market is encouraging and we think signals a more important  longer lasting leadership change   Wilson wrote   Whether we are right or wrong  we think getting this right will be more important than calling the index level for the rest of the year  ",2018-11-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-turns-a-bit-less-bearish-on-stocks-1674116,1674116

145133,366648,STT,Circle in Talks With U S  to Become Licensed Bank  Trading Venue,news," Bloomberg     Circle Internet Financial Ltd   one of the world s most valuable cryptocurrency platforms  is looking to make a big leap into the highly regulated realm of U S  banks and brokerages 
The venture  partly backed by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS    plans to seek a federal banking license to provide more services to customers  It also intends to pursue registration as a brokerage and trading venue with the Securities and Exchange Commission  so it can help investors buy and sell tokens deemed to be securities 
Circle leaders including Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Allaire laid out those aspirations in an interview with Bloomberg  It s uncharted territory  No venture that began in the largely unchecked world of digital currencies has obtained such status with U S  regulators  While getting a banking license would subject it to tough scrutiny  the move would winnow the field of regulators Circle must appease because federal laws would pre empt a patchwork of state rules covering crypto 
 You re able to have a single conversation   said Robert Bench  Circle s chief compliance officer   It s hard to have 50 conversations  
Circle officials say they ve had preliminary conversations with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to explore banking functions  as well as with staff at the SEC and officials from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  which oversees brokerages  The firm is likely to pursue SEC regulation before the banking license  The OCC and Finra declined to comment  SEC spokesmen didn t respond to requests for comment 
Accessing Fed
A bank charter would make Circle less dependent on traditional lenders  potentially letting it hold customer assets in the form of digital coins or government issued currencies such as U S  dollars  It could also plug into other components of the financial system 
 To hold reserves with the Federal Reserve  to natively access the central banking system without intermediaries  to directly settle with other banks in other markets around the world through those networks    that can improve the efficiency of what we deliver  it can reduce the costs   Allaire said 
After thriving for years outside government oversight  crypto firms are building relationships with U S  regulators  potentially exerting more influence over the drafting of rules for the young industry 
Coinbase  one of the nation s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms  has also broached the topic of a potential banking license with regulators  according to two people with knowledge of the matter  In January  company officials met with the OCC s chief innovation officer  Beth Knickerbocker  according to calendar entries obtained by Bloomberg under the Freedom of Information Act  A charter was among topics raised  a person with knowledge of the gathering said  Elliott Suthers  a spokesman for Coinbase  declined to comment 
Other banking overseers  including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  and Fed  also have heard from crypto firms  Ivy Koin  a business payment system  met with regulators this year after reaching out to the FDIC for guidance on complying with rules  according to Gary Fan  the firm s president  The company doesn t expect to apply for a bank charter in the near term  he said in an interview 
A key part of Circle s pitch to OCC staff is that it would use its expertise to help develop standards for one of the biggest challenges facing traditional financial firms interested in handling cryptocurrencies  how to act as a custodian of those assets 
On Wall Street  firms like  State Street  Corp  NYSE STT   provide custody services such as holding securities for investment advisers  Banks and brokerages in that realm must be so called qualified custodians under SEC rules  But the industry has so far struggled to adopt an acceptable way to hold cryptocurrencies  The technology is relatively new  presenting challenges for verifying and guarding holdings    especially in a world where hackers have proven adept at cracking security and siphoning off large hoards 
 Guinea Pig 
Virtual coin enthusiasts argue that solving the issue around custody will pave the way for more widespread investment in the asset class  With State Street and others so far on the sidelines  crypto focused firms have tried to fill the gap with custody offerings of their own  but have realized they probably need federal licenses to get big investors on board 
 The regulators need to figure this out because eventually other banks that they regulate are going to want to hold crypto   Circle CEO Allaire said   They re going to need to have rules for this  We can be a great guinea pig  
U S  bank regulators have long maintained an arm s length relationship with cryptocurrencies  watching developments as the markets surged in just a few years from concept into assets with values in the hundreds of billions of dollars  Meanwhile  officials at market regulators like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission frequently quip in public appearances about the amount of time they dedicate to policy questions about virtual coins 
SEC Concerns
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said most coins sold by ventures in initial offerings are really unregistered securities  That means venues handling those tokens need to register as exchanges  become alternative trading systems or broker dealers  While it s not a public bourse like the New York Stock Exchange  an ATS can provide many of the same functions of matching buyers with sellers 
 The SEC staff has concerns that many online trading platforms appear to investors as SEC registered and regulated marketplaces when they are not   the agency said in March  inviting companies behind trading venues to contact authorities  If the regulator believes a firm is in violation it can bring an enforcement action seeking penalties 
Circle officials said the company is interested in becoming an ATS  either by applying or by purchasing a platform that s already got that status  Earlier this year  Circle bought Poloniex Inc   one of the larger digital token platforms  which offers dozens of coins and margin trading  Allaire says Poloniex already delisted numerous tokens to conform with SEC guidance issued last year  With Circle at the helm  it may cut more soon amid an analysis 
 We re making our own legal determinations because you can t call up the SEC and say   Is this a security or not    he said   You can expect to see us delist further things and that s the prudent thing to do  ",2018-06-06,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/circle-in-talks-with-us-to-become-licensed-bank-trading-venue-1482305,1482305

145140,366655,STT,From Goldman to Deutsche Bank  What to Watch for in Stress Tests,news," Bloomberg     Can large U S  banks hand  170 billion to their shareholders in the next 12 months  Will a top European investment bank botch the first public stress test of its entire U S  business 
The Federal Reserve will answer those questions and more when it posts results from the second and final stage of its 2018 stress test Thursday at 4 30 p m  While investors got hints during the first stage last week  the central bank has repeatedly found ways to surprise in past reviews of banks  risk management and proposed cash payouts 
The results    good or bad    will land at a tense moment for bank stocks  The S P 500 Financials Index fell a 13th straight day on Wednesday  the longest losing streak on record  Investors are concerned that recent interest rate trends could crimp revenue from lending or that a trade war might derail global growth 
Here are the firms that analysts and investors are watching 
Goldman   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS 
In the first stage of the test  leverage ratios at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   and Morgan Stanley were projected to drop close to the minimum allowed in a stressed scenario  sounding alarm bells about their ability to increase payouts to shareholders  That test examined hypothetical losses with dividends continuing as before  The second phase looks at requests for future stock buybacks and higher dividends  Both firms quickly issued statements after last week s result to warn against reading too much into it  arguing their capacity to distribute capital may be greater than what the numbers suggested 
Still  analysts have grown more skeptical the firms can increase their payouts    or in Goldman s case  that it can even maintain last year s level 
 We don t get to see all the details of how the Fed gets to its numbers  but it s still hard to fathom how they can meet pre test expectations   said Brian Kleinhanzl at Keefe  Bruyette   Woods   The math just doesn t work  
The pair may have to lower their proposed payouts to pass  Kleinhanzl said  Goldman already took that so called mulligan twice since 2013  when the option was introduced  Morgan Stanley has used it once  Others saw the statements as lobbying the Fed for leniency  which could work in the bank friendly regulatory environment under President Donald Trump 
 In the past that basically fell on deaf ears   said Gerard Cassidy  analyst at RBC Capital Markets   The new guys might look at it a little differently  
 Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn 
Analysts aren t confident that Deutsche Bank AG s U S  operations can pass a key part of the test  the qualitative review of risk controls  internal oversight and other aspects of management  The bank s U S  unit already was placed on a Fed list of troubled lenders because its systems were deemed insufficient 
Like other big foreign banks operating in the U S   the German firm was required to consolidate U S  units under an umbrella holding company subject to the tests    with results to be made public for the first time this year  But the company s U S  custodian unit took part in past tests  failing twice  The reasons then were similar to what landed the whole U S  subsidiary on the Fed s watch list 
 It s pretty hard to expect a positive surprise for the state of Deutsche Bank s controls   said Markus Riesselmann  an analyst at Independent Research in Frankfurt   Sadly  we re all pretty much used to bad news around Deutsche Bank  so a negative result won t necessarily hurt their share price  
Banks can fail the qualitative exam even with strong capital  Deutsche Bank s custodian unit had about 29 percent capital under stress both years it failed  The full U S  subsidiary s capital fell to 12 percent in last week s projections  significantly higher than the minimum 4 5 percent  The business didn t send any dividends home last year despite exceeding capital requirements  Failing this week would prevent it from doing so once again 
Other Foreign Banks
Other newbies this year include the U S  units of  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Group AG  Royal Bank of Canada and UBS Group AG  Even though they all handily passed the quantitative portion last week  they could be tripped up in the qualitative section as they adjust to the Fed s expectations 
 The qualitative assessment will be the tricky test   KBW s European analysts wrote in a note June 22   New entrants statistically find passing a challenge  
Even the largest U S  banks failed in the early years of the tests for qualitative reasons as they struggled to adapt  Such incidents petered out as the banks got the hang of the exercise  Last year  most were exempted from that portion as the threshold was raised 
The Rest
 State Street  Corp  NYSE STT   also came close last week to the minimum for its leverage ratio and might have to curtail plans for payouts  according to KBW s Kleinhanzl  But the rest of the field    20 U S  lenders and seven foreign banks with U S  operations    are all expected to get the green light  That means U S  based firms could boost payouts by  30 billion while arms of foreign banks send cash home 
Here s a snapshot of the payouts analysts were estimating for some of the largest banks before last week s results were announced ",2018-06-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/from-goldman-to-deutsche-bank-what-to-watch-for-in-stress-tests-1510109,1510109
145151,366666,STT,Do Banks Really Have Anything To Fear From Brexit ,opinion,"by Jason Martin
As the fourth round of Brexit negotiations  scheduled for September 25  nears  the volume of complaints coming from the financial services sector regarding the lack of progress is growing  That makes sense  Until Britain and the European Union ink their trade agreements  banks operating in the region are unable to forge ahead with strategies for their own multinational businesses 
Bank stock prices and public opinion about the value of London as a financial center clearly show that in all likelihood  much of this is political  noise   As we ll discuss  the impact of politicians  decisions about the future relationship between the UK and the EU will have little if any serious impact on the banking sector and our findings suggest that investors may do better to focus on other considerations 
Brexit  Negotiators Continue to Bicker
EU negotiators have insisted that before talks on trade can begin  key topics such as citizens  rights  the UK s payment upon departure and discussion over the Irish border must be dealt with 
However  even after the third round of talks concluded at the end of August  Brexit negotiators seemed unable to even agree on whether any progress has been made 
 We did not get any decisive progress on any of the principle subjects   European Chief Negotiator for Brexit Michel Barnier said at the end of the last negotiations  although he conceded that discussions over the Irish border had been  fruitful  
Conversely  his British counterpart David Davis  UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union  asserted that both parties had made  some concrete progress  
The obvious difference of opinion naturally makes one wonder whether Barnier and Davis had in fact even been in the same meetings as they negotiated the terms for the UK s departure from the EU  leaving banks in a constant state of uncertainty ahead of key decisions on how to progress with their Brexit strategies 
Banks in Strategic Limbo 
 Faced with no clarity of the future relationship between the EU and the UK  market participants are having to take important decisions amid considerable uncertainty   the Association for Financial Markets in Europe  AFME   that styles itself as the  voice of Europe s wholesale financial markets   warned in a recent report 
In conjunction with UK Finance  which represents nearly 300 of the leading firms providing finance  banking  markets and payments related services in or from the UK  AFME published a joint paper with suggestions for British and European authorities on how to deal with the issues arising from Brexit 
 Contractual uncertainty of cross border contracts post Brexit needs to be addressed promptly by all parties to avoid damaging impacts for customers on both sides of the Channel   UK Finance CEO Steven Jones said 
 This issue is wide ranging and not just limited to banking  affecting cross border products and services across payments  insurance and investment management services also   he added 
 It is estimated that  1 3 trillion   1 56 trillion  of UK based bank assets are related to the cross border provision of financial products and services   many of which support EU exporting businesses that are key drivers of growth   AFME chief executive Simon Lewis specified 
Both experts suggested that clarifying these issues was  critical  
At the crux of the problem is exactly that  contractual uncertainty  with global banks lacking details on what will be required for them to continue business as usual  and even if that will be at all possible 
While headlines are awash with information about banks setting up contingency plans that include moving some employees to Frankfurt or Dublin  according to a report earlier this month  fewer than 10 of the approximately 40 banks that conduct EU business out of London have actually filed formal applications so far for a license to continue banking in the bloc after Britain leaves 
Among those 40 financial institutions that do business in the EU and are based in London  there are British lenders and US investment banks  along with some smaller groups from both Asia and the Middle East  according to Sabine Lautenshlaeger  vice chair at the European Central Bank s division for the supervision of banks 
In some cases such as Barclays  NYSE BCS   Citigroup  NYSE C   HSBC  NYSE HSBC   JP Morgan  NYSE JPM  and State Street  NYSE STT   their subsidiaries in London are already big enough to be supervised by the ECB directly  although the question remains regarding exactly what permission  if any  they would need if they opt to expand their operations to the Continent 
Among British banks  Barclays itself has announced plans to secure an expanded license for its subsidiary in Ireland  while Royal Bank of Scotland  NYSE RBS  is reportedly negotiating with Dutch regulators over the switch of some staff and business to its already existing subsidiary in the Netherlands  Lloyds  NYSE LYG  and Standard Chartered  LON STAN  have given indications that they could pursue formal submissions before the end of the year 
Even though the Brexit cutoff date is not until March 2019  the application for a banking license  to an EU member state s national regulator and to the ECB  can take six to 12 months  or even longer in the event of a rush of requests 
The fourth round of UK EU negotiations was delayed by a week and will now take place on September 25 because of an upcoming speech from British Prime Minister Theresa May 
According to May s spokesman  the Prime Minister will speak on September 22 in Florence  Italy to outline the kind of ties Britain wants to have with the EU after it leaves the bloc  setting the stage for the discussions to follow 
The fifth round of negotiations was tentatively scheduled for October 9  coming just 10 days ahead of a two day EU summit 
Breaking with the hardline from EU negotiators  reports near the end of August suggested that French diplomats were pushing to begin trade talks with Britain as early as October 
In that light  the upcoming EU summit may serve as a pivot point for the region s politicians to reconsider their positions on the issue  although more skeptical observers point to the current lack of progress and suggest that the following summit in mid December would be a more likely scenario for serious talks to begin 
London Remains Top Financial Center  Bank Stocks Unpunished
All that aside  little impact has been seen on either London s status as the world s number one ranked financial center or bank stock prices in general 
In Z Yen s 22nd edition of rankings of global financial centers  known as GFCI 22  London continued to hold the premier spot against 107 competitors 

 Interestingly  despite the ongoing Brexit negotiations  London only fell two points  the smallest decline in the top ten centers   the surveyor noted 
That compared to a 24 point fall for New York  which Z Yen explained was  presumably due to fears over US trade  
Financial centers on the Continent remained volatile 

 Overall assessments for the European centers continued to fluctuate as people speculate about which centers might benefit from London leaving the EU  

 However  the majority of centers in the region rose with Stockholm  Copenhagen  and Vienna all showing strong rises   the surveyor concluded 
British and European bank stocks have remained unscathed since the UK s EU referendum  held on June 23  2016 
As can be seen in the comparative chart below  the biggest banks by total assets in the UK  France  Germany and Spain have all seen considerable upside despite any supposed concerns over future regulation 

Specifically  UK s HSBC  LON HSBA  has seen shares rise by nearly 43  since the EU referendum  while France s BNP Paribas  PA BNPP  is 38  higher and Spain s Banco Santander  MC SAN  boasts gains of 35  to name a few examples  Even Germany s Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   whose stock has been pummeled by concerns about its turnaround plan  has still managed to return gains of 3  during the period in question 
The GFCI 22 and the above examples of stock prices from the largest banks show that opinion has been unaffected by worries over how eventual agreements between the UK and the EU will pan out 
Undoubtedly  financial institutions face certain  contractual uncertainties  as they wait for negotiators to iron out their differences and lay down what future regulations will be  It s not surprising that JP Morgan  NYSE JPM   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Citigroup  NYSE C  and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  sought to maintain the status quo prior to the UK vote and all donated to the campaign for Britain to remain a part of the EU 
For investors  the underlying question is exactly how the overall effect will hit banks  books  Admittedly  reorganization costs could definitely hit the bottom line  but there is no way to calculate this unknown 
In fact  London is not exactly the cheapest place in the world to do business and banks might actually benefit from relocating services to cheaper locations   Longer term  US banks could benefit given high costs in London   a CLSA analyst told the Financial Times back in July 2016  not long after the vote for the UK to leave the EU became a reality 
There have been far too many  self interested  comments on what could happen depending on the outcome of negotiations in order to make a feasible estimate of how one outcome or the other will eventually affect the bottom line  In general  banks are fighting to maintain the status quo as much as possible 
What needs to be kept in mind is that the uncertainty of the Brexit isn t the only factor to be considered  Citigroup chief financial officer John Gerspach recently warned that third quarter total markets revenue was running about 15  less than a year earlier when volatility was boosted by reactions to the Brexit vote and US elections 
In other words  external factors are already hampering trading revenues via the year on year comparison  And that has nothing to do with the Brexit negotiations 
Banks  business models will  without a doubt  need adjustments whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiation may be  However  until the endgame is decided by Brexit negotiators  trying to predict what the impact will be on the bottom line is merely sport for pundits 
Add to that the fact that financial institutions have an uncanny way of pushing through paperwork in order to secure regulatory loopholes allowing them to carry through with their strategies 
As it stands  the ECB has already highlighted its very concerns with regard to the issue  Banks can currently avoid the monetary authority s supervision by applying for a broker dealer license to the national supervisor of European countries  rather than a banking license 
While that would bar them from taking deposits or writing loans  they would still be able to deal in securities 
In short  the clock may be ticking for Brexit negotiators  but financial institutions will likely take the results whatever they may be in stride  To judge from the prices of bank stocks since the EU referendum  concerns so far are negligible 
Investors would do better to worry about the impact of central banks  considerations for the removal of accommodative policy on the balance sheets of financial institutions rather than the  as of yet  incalculable effect of the  possible  reallocation of resources in the face of undetermined political decisions ",2017-09-18,Jason Martin/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/do-banks-really-have-anything-to-fear-from-brexit-200213672,200213672

potential investors in digital currency hedge funds who have otherwise warmed up to the volatile asset class  Traditional custodian banks such as Bank of New York Mellon Corp  N BK  and  State Street  Corp  N STT  do not yet handle crypto assets like bitcoin  That means hedge funds have been forced far from Wall Street to places like Springfield  Pennsylvania  or Murray  Kentucky  to find auditors  custodians and record keepers  according to fund disclosures and executives  Dealing with this collection of small and relatively unknown firms has sparked concern among potential investors and their advisers  who worry about a lack of scale  history and brand name  That  in turn  is keeping a lid on some new investment in digital currencies   See graphic    The usual safeguards  are either non

called infrastructure for crypto hedge funds  pretty green   Both LGT and Cliffwater have so far steered institutional clients clear of cryptocurrency funds  partly because of concerns about underdeveloped infrastructure  SMALL CUSTODIANS  Pension funds  endowments and other large investors generally expect the hedge funds they entrust their money with to use major banks and accounting firms as custodians  administrators and auditors to ensure their fund investments are safe   Hedge funds are required by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission to use a qualified custodian  which includes federally insured banks and registered broker dealers  once their assets exceed  150 million   The example of Bernard Madoff  whose massive Ponzi scheme was enabled in part by an obscure accountant  has only increased investors  wariness   After bitcoin hit almost  20 000 in December  more than 10 times what it was worth five months before  the SEC highlighted  significant investor protection issues that need to be examined   including valuation  liquidity and custody for cryptocurrency funds   A few large service providers are considering getting into the digital currency

But how can you invest in this growth 
After all  many companies in the ETF world such as Vanguard  the  2 asset manager are not publicly traded  And others that dominate the space  such as Blackrock s  BLK  iShares or State Street s  STT  SPDRs  are not the entire business for their massive parents  So  what s an investor to do 
Well  if you are looking to invest in the world of ETFs  Mike Venuto  the CIO of Toroso Investments  has some insights  Mike is behind the Toroso ETF Industry Index  the benchmark behind the first fund to offer direct and focused exposure to the ETF industry  the ETF Industry Exposure   Financial Services ETF  TETF  
We discuss this benchmark  and investing in the ETF industry in general  in this week s edition of the Dutram Report 
Industry in Focus
In the podcast  Mike and I address talk of an  ETF bubble  and why we have seen such incredible growth in ETFs over the past few years  We also talk about hurdles to future growth in the market  and the possibility of moving past mutual funds in terms of assets at some point down the line too 
We also discuss some of the key players in the ETF world  and what to do with companies that have exposure to ETFs  but aren t pure plays  I admit that I was a bit skeptical about this aspect  but Mike makes a case for why some of the giants are more tied to ETFs than you might think  and how you can access some of the private companies with service providers too 
What s in the Index 
While it shouldn t be a surprise that a company like WisdomTree  WETF  is in the benchmark  considering it is the only pure play ETF sponsor that is a public company  there are others that might be more of a surprise to some investors out there  This includes SEI Investments and CBOE Holdings  CBOE  just to name a few 
Mike also discusses the role that index providers play in the world of ETFs  and how important this business is to companies like MSCI Inc   MSCI  and S P Global  SPGI  as well  Clearly  the ETF world is a bit more diverse than you  and I  initially thought  and it is also more than just a higher growth replacement for XLF  In fact  Mike notes that the benchmark has just a 20  overlap with the index underlying the SPDR financial sector ETF  meaning that this is definitely giving exposure to a unique subset of companies 
So  if you re an ETF  nerd  like both Mike and I are definitely check out this week s podcast for more information on the industry and how to invest in its surging growth prospects too

Shares of Regions Financial have gained nearly 1  year to date versus the  s decline of 6 5  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings have remained stable at  1 00 over the last 30 days  Thus  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

Regions Financial s expense control initiatives are encouraging  Though costs increased slightly in the last completed quarter due to investments in enhanced online banking platform and other technology initiatives  the company remains on track to achieve  300 million expense reduction by 2018 through branch consolidations  Regions Financial s efforts to reduce expenses along with generating new sources of revenues are commendable 
Also  Regions Financial s efforts are supported by its strong capital position  As part of its 2017 capital plan  it raised the common stock dividend by 28 6  and plans to repurchase up to  1 47 billion common stock  Further  the company s consistently improving financial performance is indicative of the sustainability of these activities 
However  the company s fee income has witnessed a declining trend over the last few years mainly due to lower securities gains and insurance proceeds  Though Regions Financial s is undertaking initiatives to increase revenues  volatile trend in non interest income has been weighing on its top line 
Also  Regions Financial is yet to solve some pending lawsuits from the investors and regulators for violation of rules and forgery  This is likely to impact its financials in the near term   
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the finance space are JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM    State Street Corporation   NYSE STT   and Carolina Financial Corporation   NASDAQ CARO    All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

President Xi Jinping didn t specify a longer term growth target at the twice a decade Party Congress in October  and policy emphasis has shifted toward quality of growth over quantity  That s led some to say China should ditch its long standing practice of setting a numerical growth target in favor of a forecast  But Yang Weimin  an official from the Communist Party committee overseeing economic policy  says targets won t be abandoned before 2020 
The annual target remains a crucial barometer of official thinking because it shows how policy makers seek to balance competing aims of growth  reform and financial deleveraging  says Shane Oliver  the head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd  in Sydney 
While markets anticipate a target of about 6 5 percent again this year  a wider goal of 6 percent to 7 percent would signal seriousness in reducing financial risk  cutting pollution  and reining in local government finance and excess capacity  says David Loevinger  a former China specialist at the U S  Treasury 
Market Jitters
There s a chance markets  which are now sanguine about the growth outlook  may be roiled if the target looks  softer  than usual with greater tolerance for slower growth  Oliver says

145172,366687,STT,Investor State Street uses financial clout to get more women to the top,news,"LONDON  Reuters    Asset manager  State Street  Global Advisors  N STT   said it will pressure companies to provide more data about the number of women employed at all levels of management and will push for greater diversity at board level 
The investor  one of the world s largest with  2 8 trillion in assets under management  said it plans to begin screening European firms in the STOXX 600  STOXX  and FTSE 350  FTLC  that it invests in and engaging with them over diversity 
The move by State Street GA  which said it planned to expand the effort in the future  comes as International Women s Day ratchets up pressure on companies across the world to do more to ensure fair treatment of women on issues including pay 
 Often when we engage with companies on the issue of board diversity we hear that the biggest challenge is a lack of suitable female candidates   said Rakhi Kumar  head of ESG Investments and Asset Stewardship for State Street GA 
 Our efforts can t stop at the board level if we truly want companies to adopt policies and practices that will help strengthen gender diversity throughout their organizations  and ultimately contribute to a greater pool of female directors qualified to serve on a board

145178,366693,STT,U S  Banks Poised To Thrive Even Without Deregulation,opinion,"Undeniably  U S  banks will get a shot in the arm if the Trump administration s proposed reforms to lower corporate taxes and ease banking regulations come into effect  An expected continuation of increasing interest rates has the potential to lift banks  profitability to levels not achieved since the last recession  whether or not the reforms materialize 
Moreover  the industry has gained enough footing on its underlying structure to enhance business returns after handling its challenges related to the past several years 
A rising rate environment holds the key to banks  success because higher rates would allow them to charge more interest on mortgages  credit cards  auto leases and all other forms of loans  helping to expand net interest margins  This would help counter any unknown threats to non interest revenues and expenses 
Also  while a full scale regulatory reform is unlikely without significant political opposition  smaller adjustments that the Trump administration could make through alternate routes would help banks lower their fixed costs 
Only time will tell whether banks will get any support from the reforms  In any case  there are underlying factors to help banks thrive in the future 
Banks  Self Sufficiency Raises Hope
Business reorganization post financial crisis  effective expense management  enhanced focus on non interest revenue sources  technical affluence  enhanced cross selling opportunities with economic growth and many more positive factors could support banks in augmenting profits steadily 
In fact  these were the factors that helped banks progress on the earnings front over the last couple of years despite their vulnerability to a flattening yield curve  regulatory hindrances and global growth instability 
With increasing capability of consumers and businesses to borrow money  prospects of loan growth are rising  So  in case the industry doesn t get significant support from the rate environment  high loan volume would back revenue growth 
Moreover  sound capital levels that banks generated by meeting strict regulatory requirements should help easily absorb likely credit costs related to their exposure to the troubled sectors  High credit risk in banks  loan portfolios led to high loan loss provisions in the past  but provisions are currently at very low levels  While the likely ease of capital restriction with Trump s success in deregulating the industry could weaken banks  credit profile  any possible disorder should be manageable for a decent period with capital power 
Though the earnings performance over the last few years has failed to more than offset the negatives arising from a challenging backdrop  the results depict banks  efforts to pair aggressive actions  like creating new revenue sources  with defensive measures  like expense control  to stay afloat 
Moreover  banks have learned how to adapt to a changing landscape and deal with crises  They can now dodge pressure from the operating environment more easily 
Banks are trying to reorganize risk management practices to address potential solvency issues from rising interest rates  Asset quality troubles are also being addressed by divesting segments containing nonperforming assets

Loans and Deposits Should Keep GrowingUncertainty related to politics and apprehension over regulatory and tax reforms have resulted in sluggish loan growth for most U S  banks in the last few quarters  and this trend may continue for some time  But overall demand for loans has been rising with recovering domestic economic conditions and easier lending standards 
Consumer  business and real estate loans have increased significantly in recent years on the back of an improved housing market  lower unemployment  higher wage growth and enhanced consumer confidence 
Further  the speculation of a continuous rise in interest rates will drive borrowers to quickly apply for loans and avoid higher cost of borrowing later  This should lead to increased demand 
On the deposit side  less levered consumers and businesses will continue to support strong deposit levels  Also  high levels of corporate cash holdings remain favorable for deposit growth  However  higher rates will increase the cost of maintaining deposits

145182,366697,STT,The Safest Banks To Buy,opinion,"Investing in the safest banks has historically been very lucrative 
They have high returns on equity  and can dig economic moats around their businesses in the form of high switching costs  Changing banks is a hassle  and most consumers don t bother to take out assets even if they find a competitor that offers slightly better rates 
Except for large conglomerates and investment banks  banking is a simple business  They borrow money at a very low rate through deposits  and lend money at a higher rate to people who need mortgage loans  personal loans  auto loans  student loans  and lines of credit  For a well managed bank  it s not too hard to keep their deposit balance going up each year  which allows for consistent annual growth 
In fact  Warren Buffett made most of his fortune by investing in banks and insurance companies 
But all investors today should remember the financial crisis for the rest of their investing careers  The recession threw institutions that were once thought to be nearly invincible into sudden insolvency  And residential real estate  the asset class that as once thought to be extraordinarily safe  crashed  Even the most well run banks cut their dividends and hunkered down for survival 
But those most well run banks survived  and eventually flourished during the recovery  giving shareholders great returns over the past decade despite the financial crisis occurring during the period 
The U S  Federal Reserve now stress tests all of the largest banks to ensure that they are well capitalized  And see if they are able to survive a recession even more severe than the one that we went through in 2008  They force banks to use less leverage than they did before  and most banks take it upon themselves to have stricter underwriting standards for their loans and take risk more seriously 
June 2017 Stress Test Results
In June  the Federal Reserve released this year s stress test report  and for the first time  all 34 banks on their list passed  Only one bank  Capital One  NYSE COF   was given  conditional  approval  and the rest were given a full green light 
The report breaks down the results of each bank  so if you re bank investor  it s a must read  They simulate an extremely severe recession  and model the impact on each bank to see if they would remain solvent and able to continue to lend even through the darkest times 
Specifically  these are the economic conditions they use 
The unemployment rate goes up to 10 
GDP falls by 6 5  from its pre recession peak
Equity prices fall 50 
Residential real estate prices fall 25 
Commercial real estate prices fall 35 
International developed markets face severe economic recessions as well
Probably the most useful chart in the report is this one 

Source  Dodd Frank Act Stress Test  June 2017
This chart shows the percentage of their total loans that each bank is expected to lose under such a severe scenario 
Discover  NYSE DFS   Capital One  NYSE COF  and American Express  NYSE AXP  have the highest expected loss rates  You might assume it s due to poor underwriting standards  but that s actually not the case  In particular  American Express and Discover are among the most conservative underwriters compared to their peers 
Instead  the divergence among banks is mostly due to the type of lending they do 
American Express and Discover are the most heavily focused on credit card lending  Credit cards have the highest loss rates during recessions  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   on the other hand  is heavily in the mortgage space  which is less volatile and less prone to losses 
The most pure play custodian banks such as State Street  NYSE STT  and Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK   commonly called BNY Mellon  have the lowest expected loan loss rates and hardly any expected absolute loan losses at all  This is because they don t participate in normal consumer banking like most other ones on the list do 
The Safest Banks Come At A Price Premium
There s no free lunch  and the banks with the lowest expected loan losses tend to command the highest valuations on their stocks  as measured by the price to earnings  P E  ratio 
State Street and BNY Mellon have P E ratios of about 17 and 16  respectively 
U S  Bancorp  NYSE USB  and Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  have P E ratios of 16 and 14 
Capital One and Discover have P E ratios of under 13 and 11 
The pure play custodial banks and the most diversified large banks  especially U S  Bancorp  have the highest credit ratings as well 
Since all 34 banks passed the stress test  they all have enough equity to withstand the expected loan losses  at least according to the Federal Reserve 
For example  American Express has the third highest percentage of expected loan losses  It s estimated to lose almost  11 billion worth of loans in this severe scenario  But they have almost  21 billion in equity to absorb that potential hit 
The banks with the higher expected loan losses tend to have less leverage  because they need that extra capital to cushion their more volatile lending activities  This is how  for example  Discover managed to remain solvent during the financial collapse despite being an almost pure play credit card lender 
All 34 banks on the list are considered well capitalized against foreseeable risks  but for some of them a recession would give them a bumpier ride as big chunks of their equity get cut away by loan losses  American Express and Discover have had rather bearish performance over the last few years  both of them currently have a stock price lower than they had in 2014  Investing in some of the more volatile picks takes a bit of a contrarian mindset  but both of them are rather attractively priced at the moment 
When you re looking for a bank to invest in  the key question to ask yourself is what degree of volatility and uncertainty you re willing to handle  An aggressive lender like Capital One is fairly diverse  but still has substantial credit card exposure and uses some of the loosest lending standards with high net loan charge offs  American Express and Discover are the most focused on credit cards  but maintain strict underwriting standards 
Some banks  like the custodial pure plays and the banks that are both diversified and conservative  like U S  Bancorp  are expected to be the safest and least volatile  but may offer lower total returns in exchange for that safety

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts State Street Beats Q4 Earnings as Trading Fees RiseImproved trading revenues drove State Street s fourth quarter 2016 operating earnings of  1 48 per share  which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 34  Also  the figure was up 22 3  year over year  The reported quarter s operating earnings included certain notable items Better than expected results were supported by a rise in net interest income and fee income  Further  asset growth aided the results  However  a significant rise in expenses hurt the quarterly numbers After considering certain non recurring items  net income available to common shareholders came in at  557 million or  1 43 per share  down from  547 million or  1 34 per share in the year ago quarter For 2016  operating earnings of  5 27 per share significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 11 and were above the 2015 figure of  4 89

Moreover  it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 71 billion Net interest revenue  on an operating basis  increased 7  from the year ago quarter to  547 million  The rise was mainly driven by higher market interest rates in the U S   disciplined liability pricing and several discrete security prepayments in the investment portfolio Also  net interest margin increased 7 basis points year over year to 1 08  Fee revenues came in at  2 20 billion  up 6  from the prior year quarter  All components of fee income showed improvement except processing fees and other revenue On an operating basis  non interest expenses were  2 14 billion  up 17 7  on a year over year basis  Increase in compensation and employee benefits costs  and information systems and communications expenses were partly offset by lower occupancy costs and other expenses As of Dec 31  2016  total assets under custody and administration were  28 8 trillion  up 5  year over year  Moreover  assets under management

The stock price has had a less interesting news cycle over the last year though  It rose with the banks from July into a consolidation that began in September  That ran through the election when it jumped higher  But since that 2 day move up after the election it has churned sideways for nearly 6 months  That may have changed late last week  That is when the stock price broke above the channel 
This took it out of the Bollinger Bands  and it pulled back toward them Friday  The Bollinger  Bands have widened to allow a move  and the RSI is bullish  In fact it touched into overbought territory and is stalling  The MACD is rising  This is a bullish set up  The broader move into the long channel suggests a Measured Move to the upside to 90 at first and then to 110  Often a break out retests the break area before moving up and this may be happening with State Street

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad market macro picture reviewed Friday  which heading into May  sees the equity markets making and testing highs again  but in a mixed fashion with strength shifting to the SPY  NYSE SPY  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  and away from the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue the pullback in its uptrend while crude oil consolidates deciding if it is a bottom or just a pause  The US Dollar Index continues to move lower while US Treasuries are biased lower in consolidation  The Shanghai Composite seems to have found support and Emerging Markets are biased to continue higher 
Volatility is back at abnormally low levels and looks to remain very low going forward  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts show strength in the SPY and QQQ in the short term but the IWM rolling over  On the longer timeframe it is similar with the QQQ leading and the SPY turning up  but the IWM stalling at resistance  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well ",2017-05-01,Gregory W.

145216,366731,STT,Fewer than 10 UK based banks have asked for EU license as Brexit looms  sources,news,"By Francesco Canepa FRANKFURT  Reuters    Fewer than ten of the approximately 40 banks that conduct EU business out of London have applied so far for a license to continue banking in the bloc after Britain leaves  regulatory sources told Reuters  The slow pace of applications is raising concern at the European Central Bank  the EU s top banking supervisor  that some lenders are not doing enough to prepare for Brexit  or may even avoid its watch through a gap in the rules  The past two months have seen a pick up in the number of banks saying they plan to set up new EU subsidiaries after Brexit  with most major U S   British and Japanese banks saying they will establish units in Frankfurt or Dublin  But supervisory sources say they have still seen few formal applications for licenses   We re having lots of meetings but not enough concrete action   one supervisor said  While Britain does not leave the EU until March 2019  bank executives have said time is already running out  it could take 18 months or more to set up a new subsidiary  given the need to relocate staff  get the requisite technology and change contractual arrangements with EU clients  The location of investment banks  European headquarters is a major issue during Britain s negotiations to leave the EU  Companies across the bloc depend for financing on global banks whose European arms are now mainly based in London  The Bank of England estimates that half of all the debt and equity issued in the EU involves financial institutions in Britain  Big banks have warned a  hard Brexit  could trigger financial instability if they were to suddenly lose access to EU markets  On Friday  Europe s banking industry group said central banks would need to be ready to inject cash into financial markets to help keep them stable  The application for a banking license  to an EU member state s national regulator and to the ECB  can take 6 12 months  and possibly longer if many banks apply at the same time  Three sources at different EU banking watchdogs told Reuters the total number of banks that had submitted applications so far across Europe was still in single digits  The ECB declined to comment on the number of applications made  but has previously expressed concern that banks are behind in their preparations   A number of the larger banks have made progress in their planning   Sabine Lautenschlaeger  who represents the ECB s supervisory arm on the board  said last month   But we have not seen many final decisions yet   A spokesman at German regulator Bafin said it had received some applications and expected this to swell into double digits eventually  The Central Bank of Ireland did not receive any applications in the first half of the year  its mid year report shows  SUBSIDIARIES According to Lautenschlaeger  there are around 40 banks that now conduct business in other EU countries from UK bases  These include UK lenders  the big Wall Street investment banks and smaller groups from Asia and the Middle East  To receive permission to operate new or expanded subsidiaries in the EU  they would have to subject their business plans  safety and the fitness of managers and investors to national and ECB banking supervisors  Most major international and UK banks already operate small licensed subsidiaries in at least one other EU country  but would still need expanded regulatory approval to transfer big chunks of their London business to them  In at least five cases     Barclays   L BARC   Citi  N C   HSBC  L HSBA   JPMorgan  N JPM  and  State Street   N STT     European subsidiaries are already big enough to be directly supervised by the ECB  although they may need further permission to expand their operations  Barclays has said it plans to secure an expanded license for its subsidiary in Ireland  Among other big banks  Royal Bank of Scotland  L RBS  is negotiating with Dutch supervisors about moving some of its staff and business to its subsidiary in the Netherlands  while Lloyds  L LLOY  and  Standard Chartered   L STAN  plan to make formal submissions this year  ESCAPING SCRUTINY The ECB has complained that some firms could avoid its supervision by setting up market divisions  known as broker dealers  rather than full blown banks  A gap in EU financial rules means brokers do not need to be approved by the ECB  only by the national market supervisor of the country they base themselves in  Bank subsidiaries that obtain only a broker dealer license  rather than an EU banking license  would not be able to take deposits or write loans for EU clients  but they could still deal in securities  The ECB worries that if banks avoid their supervision it could bring additional risks  Global investment bank  Morgan Stanley   N MS  may be among those taking this route  A source has told Reuters the U S  firm  which already has a licensed bank in Germany  has applied for a brokerage license from German market and banking supervisor Bafin  The ECB has asked EU lawmakers to close the loophole that allows banks to obtain brokerage licenses without ECB supervision  but this has yet to happen  Another factor keeping some banks from moving too fast in their Brexit plans is the challenge of negotiating with staff about moving out of London  
 The delay in applications could also be due to considerations not to lose top level employees   a German supervisor said ",2017-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fewer-than-10-ukbased-banks-have-asked-for-eu-license-as-brexit-looms-sources-525953,525953

145248,366763,STT,Will Big Banks  Revised  Living Wills  Satisfy Regulators ,opinion,Big banks are trying again to satisfy the banking regulators  the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp    FDIC    This is being done to ensure that the banks can easily be navigated through bankruptcy proceedings  without destabilizing the country s financial stability at the time of crisis  Banks submitted their updated  Living Wills  last week before the Oct 1 deadline Revised  Living Wills  in BriefThis time  stakes are high for JPMorgan Chase  Co    NYSE JPM    Bank of America Corp    NYSE C    The Bank of New York Mellon Corp    NYSE BK    Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   and State Street Corp    NYSE STT    This is because the regulators in April had deemed their resolution plans  not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U S  Bankruptcy Code  Hence  in the documents  released on Tuesday  these five banks provided details regarding their plans designed to rectify problems identified by the regulators For instance  JPMorgan altered its business organization  creating a new  intermediate holding company  and has already started moving assets to it  The company says that the new entity will be  ready to make capital and liquidity contributions  to other divisions in case of failure  Also  the entity has contractual obligation to make sure that resources are directed at the right places  in case the company collapses Further  JPMorgan has identified 16  objects of sale   that can easily be sold off during a financial crisis  Moreover  the bank has  meaningfully simplified  the way it funds entities within the company Likewise  BofA said that it has already transferred its assets to a pre existing intermediate company for same purpose as JPMorgan s  Also  the company expanded its liquidity stress testing methods to include the capability to project  forecasted liquidity needs  on a daily basis for each unit  Further  it has formed a new monitoring and reporting team as well as enterprise resolution execution office Similarly  Wells Fargo raised the number of employees dedicated to resolution planning  Also  the bank has appointed a senior executive to this office  who will be directly reporting to the chief financial officer  Further  similar to JPMorgan  the bank created a detailed report for potential  strategic sale transactions  Wells Fargo has also been  increasing both the liquid assets available to meet its needs in a time of stress and the amount of capital available to absorb potential losses   Moreover  the company continues to eliminate  redundant  dormant or inactive  subsidiaries  Wells Fargo stated   Eliminating redundant  dormant  or inactive subsidiaries helps reduce complexity and thereby improves both the ongoing operation and the resolvability of the company  On the other hand  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS   and Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   were able to satisfy the Fed and the FDIC  to some extent  with their resolution plans in April  Citigroup had received a passing grade by both regulators  despite requiring improvement in its  Living Will   However  Goldman and Morgan Stanley received passing grades from only one of the two agencies Notably  these three companies have also submitted their updated resolution plans  These plans highlight the moves designed by the banks to rectify their shortcomings  before the next annual submission on Jul 1  2017 Requirement of  Living Wills Under provisions of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  the banks  with total consolidated assets of  50 billion or more  are required to put forward a framework  This framework will be indicating the ways to liquidate  by breaking up and selling off assets  in case they are on the verge of collapse The main goal behind the submission of  Living Wills  is to avoid re run of the 2008 financial crisis  the period when Lehman Brothers Inc  went down  The  Living Wills  will reduce the risks of further bailouts  if these banks sink in the event of another financial crisis A systemic resolution  maximizing the sale value of a failed bank and minimizing creditor losses  would help in efficient handling of bank failures  Moreover  the FDIC will have the power to liquidate a bank if its collapse knocks down the country s financial stability  Also   Living Wills  are required to be submitted on an annual basis Can  Living Wills  Serve Their Purpose The Fed and the FDIC will be reviewing  Living Wills  of banks in the coming months  though there is no time frame provided for result declaration  Only time will tell whether banks have been able to satisfy the regulators this time around  by proving  Living Wills  adequate for implementation In case  the regulatory authorities do not consider the above mentioned rectifications adequate  the banks will have to face tougher capital requirements and restrictions on operations or activities  If  within two years  after the requirements are imposed  banks fail to remediate the problems  then the Fed and the FDIC can jointly require it to shed assets Though banks have revised their resolution plans to overcome the shortcomings pointed out by the Fed and the FDIC  it is a big question if  Living Wills  will serve its purpose or not  Hypothetically  it is easy to say that resolution plans should be made in a way such that they would not adversely affect the overall financial system  However  in practice  it is difficult to mitigate the harm  as banks depend considerably on mutual businesses Nevertheless  we believe  Living Wills  will help the regulators to wind up banks  in case of failures  to some extent  Most importantly  the advance precautions will surely entail into lesser involvement of taxpayers  money for bailing out troubled financial institutions Of the eight stocks mentioned in the article  only

145250,366765,STT,3 Bank Stocks Poised To Deliver Earnings Beat In Q3,opinion,"The U S  banks  constituting a major part of the Finance sector  have always drawn substantial attention from investors during the earnings season  While the industry backdrop has not been favorable since the beginning of the year  banks managed to deliver a decent performance in the first two quarters  The upcoming results are not expected to be disappointing either 

A low interest rate environment  the biggest concern for banks  continued to prevail in the quarter  The market was speculating a hike in September  but the Federal Reserve maintained a dovish stance  Therefore  net interest margin is expected to remain under pressure 

Nonetheless  on the non interest income front  trading revenues are anticipated to rise  driven by the strength in fixed income and currencies  Equity trading is likely to remain lackluster 

Further  mortgage banking fees are anticipated to improve slightly as the low mortgage rates during the quarter might have pushed people to refinance home loans  Moderate growth in fresh mortgage originations is also expected 

Per preliminary Thomson Reuters data  M A activity remains robust  but the total deal value of announced M As across the world declined during the quarter  Also  global economic concerns led to lower IPOs  Therefore  banks are not likely to see growth in advisory and investment banking fees 

On expense front  banks are continuously looking for cost saving opportunities to improve the bottom line performances  Among other steps to curb costs  banks are increasingly spending on technological advancements in order to substitute labor and manage higher volumes  and increase operational efficiency 

Additionally  a substantial decrease in legal expenses will be another major positive for the third quarter results  This is also expected to reduce the provisions for legal expenses 

Additionally  as the oil prices continue to rebound  provisions for energy sector loans are expected to decline  Moreover  as the economy continues to recover  delinquencies are expected to decline and overall asset quality is likely witness improvement 

The broader finance sector is expected to witness 3 9  year over year earnings growth in the third quarter  This compares favorably with 5 2  decline witnessed in the prior quarter

145260,366775,STT,Ex State Street executive to plead guilty in U S  to fraud scheme,news,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON  Reuters    A former  State Street  Corp  NYSE STT  executive has agreed to plead guilty in connection with a scheme to defraud six clients through secret commissions on billions of dollars of trades  according to court papers filed on Tuesday 
Edward Pennings  a former senior managing director in State Street s London office  has agreed to plead guilty to one court of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud  according to a plea agreement filed in federal court in Boston 
In addition  Richard Boomgaardt  who was head of State Street s transition management desk for Europe  the Middle East and Africa  was charged with one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud 
Boomgaardt  who lives in the United Kingdom  was charged by  information   a type of document that prosecutors usually use in connection with defendants who intend to plead guilty  It was unclear if he had reached a plea deal 
No plea hearing has been scheduled yet for Pennings  who lives in the United Kingdom  Lawyers for Pennings and Boomgaardt did not respond to requests for comment 
The former State Street executives are among three who have been charged by U S  prosecutors since April 2016 in connection with the probe  The bank agreed in January to pay  64 6 million to resolve related U S  criminal and civil investigations 
The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston based bank paid a fine of  22 9 million  or  38 million at the time  for charging the six clients mark ups on certain transactions 
Prosecutors said that from 2010 to 2011  Pennings  Boomgaardt and Ross McLellan  a former executive vice president  conspired to add secret commissions to fixed income and equity trades performed for certain clients 
Prosecutors said the clients were using a State Street unit that helps institutional customers move investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios 
The commissions  which the former executives took steps to hide  came on top of fees the clients agreed to pay despite written instructions to the bank s traders that they should not have to do so  prosecutors have said 
The clients included a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund  a public pension fund in Dublin  Ireland  and a pension fund for British government employees  according to court papers 
McLellan has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and wire fraud charges  His trial is scheduled for October 
The cases in U S  District Court  District of Massachusetts  are U S  v  McLellan  et al  No  16 cr 10094  and U S  v  Boomgaardt  No  17 cr 10167 ",2017-06-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ex-state-street-executive-to-plead-guilty-in-u.s.-to-fraud-scheme-492543,492543

145285,366800,STT,High stakes vote on Wells Fargo board also tests proxy adviser ISS,news,"By Ross Kerber and Dan Freed BOSTON  Reuters    A high stakes shareholder vote at  Wells Fargo    Co  N WFC  next week will determine whether the bank has done enough to retain investor confidence after its phony account scandal  and whether a leading proxy adviser wields enough clout to help oust most of its board  In one of its toughest shareholder notes  Institutional Shareholder Services  ISS  recommended earlier this month that investors vote against 12 of the 15 directors on Wells Fargo s ballot at the company s annual meeting on April 25  including independent chairman Stephen Sanger  ISS argued they had all failed in their oversight duties  The recommendation was another blow to the country s third largest bank  which has been struggling for months to move past revelations that thousands of employees created as many as 2 million accounts in customers  names without permission to hit lofty sales targets  ISS s recommendation followed one by Glass Lewis  its closest competitor  which recommended votes against six directors for similar reasons  The ball is now in the shareholders  court  A sampling of investors who spoke to Reuters were split on how to vote  It would be extremely unusual for most directors at a company the size of Wells Fargo to turn over suddenly  without pressure from an activist investor  but ISS s scathing review was also rare  According to Proxy Insight  among the 2 780 meetings held by S P 500 companies since 2012  ISS has recommended votes against 80 percent or more of directors in just seven cases besides Wells Fargo  Each involved a special circumstance  like only a few directors being up for re election  ISS s Wells Fargo recommendation was  among the harshest that I can recall   said Bruce Goldfarb  president of proxy solicitation firm Okapi Partners   An ISS spokesman declined to comment  Wells Fargo representatives cited an April 7 statement calling the ISS recommendation  extreme and unprecedented   ISS is the largest proxy adviser  with about 1 700 clients versus Glass Lewis s 1 200  and has faced concerns it wields undue influence over corporate elections  On average  directors who ISS recommends  against  receive 17 percent to 18 percent less support  according to consulting firm Semler Brossy  Activists have criticized big fund managers for blindly following ISS  Institutional investors have built up large corporate governance departments in recent years and say they make their own judgments  But breaking with ISS and supporting the whole Wells Fargo board could be difficult for fund firms  said Michael Goldstein  a Babson College finance professor   This may be one of those cases where you don t want to have to answer a lot of questions about why did you support these people   Goldstein said   DONE ENOUGH   If shareholders do vote against some of Wells Fargo s directors  it does not mean they will immediately leave  The bank s guidelines require directors offer to resign if they fail to receive a majority of votes cast  but leaves the board wiggle room in deciding whether to accept a resignation  In other cases with fewer directors at risk  shareholder sentiment mattered  Some of JPMorgan Chase   Co s  N JPM  directors resigned in 2013 when they won only narrow majorities after the  London Whale  trading scandal   Directors who fail to win majorities are in an even weaker position buy may not leave right away  For instance  two Chesapeake Energy Corp  N CHK  directors received less than 30 percent support at its annual meeting in mid 2012 and offered to resign  The board accepted the resignation of one director two weeks later and did not accept the resignation of the other until the following March  Wells Fargo s board and management have said the steps taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for sales abuses show there is now strong oversight  and that directors nominated deserve to be elected  In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday  Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said ousting most of the board would be  crazy   The San Francisco based bank paid  190 million in a September regulatory settlement for the unauthorized accounts  igniting a public firestorm that hammered its shares and led to the resignation of then Chairman and CEO John Stumpf  Since then  Sloan replaced Stumpf  and Sanger became the independent chairman  The board took steps like eliminating sales goals  revamping its compensation structure and withholding or clawing back tens of millions of dollars of bonuses  Shareholders interviewed in recent days voiced a range of views about whether Wells Fargo s board needs an overhaul  Top investor  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa  has already voted in favor of the board  Other big shareholders  including  State Street  Corp  N STT  and Vanguard Group declined to comment or did not respond to questions  Rhode Island Treasurer Seth Magaziner  who oversees funds that own Wells Fargo shares  said they will vote against directors flagged by ISS   Directors are meant to be agents for the shareholders  and watchdogs for the investors   he said   Clearly that level of oversight was lacking at Wells Fargo   Others were supportive  Gideon Bernstein  partner at wealth management firm Leisure Capital  said he plans to back the board  He was impressed with the bank s April 10 report describing what went wrong  and actions taken in response   The board has done a really good job drilling down   he said  Thomas Russo  managing member at Gardner  Russo   Gardner  said he has not yet decided how to vote  He wants to see a smaller board with more banking experience   There s an elevated sense of urgency in a smaller board and a board that has more specific knowledge   he said  Executives at American Century Investments also have not yet decided  Senior investment analyst Adam Krenn said the bank s oversight and initial response was lacking  But portfolio manager Michael Liss praised the eventual response

WELLS FARGO NEW Price     
A class of investors sees the current stock price movement as a long term investment opportunity  However  it is worth analyzing a bit more to understand the real downside Fallout from the ScamBusiness Impact   Cross selling   which has been Wells Fargo s key strength in the recent years and contributed to its profits  was at the heart of the regulators  claim of  widespread illegal practice  of the bank  It was alleged that employees of the bank unlawfully enrolled consumers in products and services without their knowledge or consent in order to receive incentives for meeting sales targets In order to address the issue  the bank  apart from terminating the concerned employees and taking necessary steps  also will remove all product sales goals in retail banking  effective Jan 1  2017  Further  the bank instructed several of its call center employees to temporarily suspend cross selling of products Such measures are likely to slow account openings  which consequently would result in reduced revenues  Eliminating sales targets while adjusting incentives may soften the growth in deposit service charges and credit card fees Litigations   Heightened Regulatory Oversight  The settlement sparked intense public and political outrage as Wells Fargo lost its customers  confidence and faith  Recently  the company s board has been hit with a lawsuit alleging breach of duty to investors  according to a Bloomberg report  Last Friday   for fraud  breach of contract and invasion of privacy  The lawsuit is seeking class action status on behalf of thousands of customers The company is under tightened regulatory scrutiny as well  Notably  The U S  Department of Justice has launched an investigation that may result in civil or criminal charges  Also  the U S  House Financial Services Committee announced last week that it has commenced an investigation into the bank  As part of the probe  the committee intends to call John Stumpf   Chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo   to testify at a hearing later this month  Stumpf  who has been facing huge criticisms  was grilled by the congress when he testified before the U S  Senate Banking Committee  earlier this week Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently said that Wells Fargo will remain under regulators  supervision  She stated   We have been distressed to see banking organizations responding when a particular problem arises  and what we d really want to see is robust procedures that ensure that employees are always acting in a legal and ethical manner  and that the incentives that are put in place in these organizations are appropriate and don t serve to foster behavior that could harm the public  And this has been  and will be  a focus of our supervision  Wells Fargo is already encountering many investigations and lawsuits from the investors and regulators  The scam will further add to its woes with potential legal actions and more probes  apart from stricter regulations Buffett Move  Another key area to watch remains the next move of the legendary investor Warren Buffett  whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa  petitioned the Federal Reserve in July to increase ownership stake at Wells Fargo above 10  However  Buffett is largely silent on the recent crisis at Wells Fargo  He told FOXBusiness   If I start commenting on that or anything else  it will lead down too many paths so I will wait until November to speak about it  the election or any other subject  While there is speculation in the market that Buffett may reduce or sell ownership stake  materialization of any such action by the largest shareholder of Wells Fargo may further affect the stock price Existing TroublesWells Fargo s revenues are already under pressure amid a stricter regulatory landscape and a persistent low interest rate scenario  Notably  Wells Fargo lowered its return on equity and return on assets targets at its annual Investor Day held in May this year The Dec 2015 rate hike was not enough to result in a significant boost  During the first six months of 2016  increased net interest income and non interest income boosted revenues  but net interest margin contracted 8 basis points on a year over year basis to 2 88  As the U S  Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday  Wells Fargo should continue to face margin pressure in the near term Downward Estimate Revisions  Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 fell 2 4  to  4 04 per share while it declined 5 6  to  4 18 for 2017 As a result  Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank   4  Sell   Along with a Sell rating  it has a  of D  which is not desirable for investing in a stock Where to Invest InsteadWith the help of the   we have zeroed in on three major bank stocks  All these stocks have witnessed at least 15  upward price movement over the past six months and sport highly desirable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see

145317,366832,STT,Ex State Street executive waives extradition to face U S  charges,news,"By Nate Raymond
 Reuters    A former  State Street  Corp  NYSE STT  executive has waived his right to UK extradition proceedings and has pleaded not guilty to U S  charges that he engaged in a scheme to defraud six clients through secret commissions on billions of dollars of trades 
Edward Pennings  a former State Street senior managing director who worked in the bank s London office  entered the plea in federal court in Boston on Monday to charges including securities fraud and wire fraud  prosecutors said 
Pennings  a Dutch citizen who resides in the United Kingdom  was released on a  2 million bond  according to a spokeswoman for the U S  Attorney s Office in Boston 
Roger Burlingame  a lawyer for Pennings  said on Tuesday that his client voluntarily came to the United States to contest the charges and to clear his name 
 He did not commit a crime and had absolutely no intent to do so   Burlingame said in an email 
The arraignment followed Pennings  indictment in April with Ross McLellan  an ex State Street executive vice president 
State Street has faced several regulatory actions involving allegations of overcharging clients  most recently resulting in its July 26 announcement that it would pay  530 million to resolve several U S  regulatory matters and lawsuits 
State Street in 2014 reached a related settlement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority  It paid a fine of 22 9 million pounds  or  38 million at the time  for charging  substantial mark ups  to six clients  including Irish and British government pension funds  on certain transactions 
Prosecutors said that from 2010 to 2011  McLellan  Pennings and others conspired to add secret commissions to fixed income and equity trades performed for the six clients 
Prosecutors said the clients were using a State Street unit that helps institutional customers move their investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios 
The commissions  which McLellan and Pennings took steps to hide  came on top of fees the clients agreed to pay despite written instructions to the bank s traders that they should not have to do so  prosecutors said 
McLellan  a Massachusetts resident  pleaded not guilty in April  Both men are scheduled to face trial in October 2017 
The case is U S  v  McLellan et al  U S  District Court  District of Massachusetts  No  16 cr 10094

145336,366851,STT,S P 500 Trendless Market  Top  May Be Ending,opinion,"   Volatility made a new Cycle low on Monday  May 4 then proceeded to run through all the resistance levels before closing near the low of its reversal pattern  A close above the May 6 high may confirm a sell signal for SPX 
S P 500 trendless market  top  may be ending 

SPX closed the week on a high note  but did not exceed its April 27 high  The May 6 low qualifies as a Master Cycle low A failure to make a new high here may have made the Cycle extremely left translated and bearish  A loss of support on Monday may signal a panic decline through the end of June  
 ZeroHedge  We don t talk too often  because we don t use them  about traditional technical analysis indicators  We have nothing against them  it s just that we have our own methodologies and processes that work for us One indicator we do like to keep an eye on is the ADX  or Average Directional Index  It is essentially an indicator of the strength  or lack of strength  of the prevailing trend over a specified period  regardless of the trend s direction  A high number indicates a strongly trending market and a low number reflects a lack of trend  The traditional default look back period is 14 days so we tend to stick with that  Interestingly  recent readings of the 14 day ADX applied to the S P 500 have been among the lowest of the last 65 years  indicating an extremely  trendless  market 
Nasdaq 100 makes a reversal pattern 

NDX made its final high on April 27  ending a five wave rally  Since then it has made an impulse down and a significant  but not a complete retracement  This is important  since the declining impulse was a Master Cycle low on May 6  Its Ending Diagonal trendline is at 4425 00  Breaking the trendline implies a complete retracement to its October 15 low at 3700 23 
 MarketWatch  U S  stocks ended the day s choppy session marginally higher Friday with the main indexes eking out weekly gains 
Investors grappled with weaker than expected economic reports which left the timing of the Federal Reserve s next rate hike still uncertain for investors 
A pair of manufacturing data released ahead of the market open  came in below expectations  underlying the recent trend of weakness poking through in the U S  economy  The preliminary May reading on consumer sentiment fell to the lowest level in seven month  also well below forecasts 
High Yield Bonds could not make a new high 

Try as it might  the High Yield Index has not been able to better its November 28 high at 147 53 The best fit Elliott Wave formation is an A B C  with Wave C falling short of the top of Wave A  That consolidation in the middle turns out to be a Triangle Wave B  which calls for a final probe to a new high  but no luck so far It now appears that the final high was a truncation  meaning it did not achieve its normal target  It also made a low on May 6 A failure at this point may cause difficulties in new high yield financing that has supported stock prices during a declining macroeconomic environment  This may not end well

145362,366877,STT,Unveiling The Gold Market s Working Parts,opinion,On the 12th and 15th April gold fell victim to a price smash  Why this happened is something which is open to much analysis and theorising  For the mainstream media it was down to an improving global economy and the need to hold gold no longer existed  for those in the world of gold investment this was perhaps down to more of the politics behind the gold market than the economics On April 12th 3 4 million ounces  100 tonnes  of gold was sold in the US futures markets  This was just for starters  the main  side and dessert appeared over the following hours and the next session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  COMEX  Reacting to the gold price smashAs those in the West holding paper gold stood frozen watching the price tick further downwards  those in the East and others looking to buy physical gold  went on a shopping spree  Premiums on physical gold in China  India  Vietnam and across Asia hit highs associated with economic and geopolitical crises  Dealers struggled to keep up with demand In the four weeks to April 24th reported inventories of ETFs  funds  and futures market depositories collapsed by over 5 5 million ounces   7 billion  The largest physical removals were reported by the COMEX of 1 4 million ounces and the SPDR Gold Trust  GLD   which reported total inventory removal of nearly 4 million ounces In their Q1 report  the World Gold Council referred to the  dichotomous nature  of the gold market   this is clear as the paper gold market continues to tell a different story to the physical market Today we continue to see ETF outflows and COMEX gold futures have fallen once again this week  Meanwhile  premiums on physical gold in Hong Kong have climbed to  5 per ounce  having been  3 last week  whilst traders in Japan are pushing premiums up in response to Chinese gold demand As the President and Executive Chairman of CME Group  Terrence Duffy  told Bloomberg following the April s gold price fall   What s interesting about gold  when we had that big break two weeks ago we saw all the gold stocks trade down significantly  we saw all the gold products trade down significantly  but one thing that did not trade down  was gold coins  tangible real gold  That s going to show you  people don t want certificates  they don t want anything else  They want the real product  Discussion is focusing on the difference between the paper gold and physical gold markets Paper gold versus physical  and where the gold price is setSince the last gold bull run in the 1970s  the moving parts of the gold market  and what drives the price  have changed dramatically But  what do people really mean when they talk about the  paper gold  and  physical  gold markets Gold futures  gold exchange traded products  ETPs  and physical gold are each different ways of gaining exposure to gold  Each form of gold exposure has its relevant gold market segment catering for investors  yet all are priced according to an international gold price We thought it was time for a comprehensive look at these different parts of the gold markets  how they interact with each other and establish the gold price itself  After this  we ask what this means for future gold price discovery and meeting gold demand The futures marketFutures contracts allow investors to efficiently trade gold  for delivery at a future date   they are one of the most efficient ways to buy gold The global gold futures market is worth around  75 billion  with liquidity  in the form of open interest spread  around the world s major financial exchanges The 100 ounce gold futures contract on the COMEX dominates this activity and accounts for 85  of gold futures trading  COMEX has mild competition from 1kg gold futures contracts traded on the SHFE  Shanghai  and TOCOM  Tokyo  which account for 7  each of the futures market There is little doubt over which gold futures market enjoys the liquidity monopoly of these exchanges and thus has the biggest impact on setting the gold price This was no better seen than back in April when several large sell orders of the June futures COMEX futures contract appeared on the market  over 120  of annual gold production was traded in one day and the gold price plummeted to levels 30  below the all time high of  1 920 The gold futures markets have been operating for decades and are now mature financial markets with deep liquidity  currently jealously guarded by COMEX and the Americans Exchange Traded ProductsExchange traded products  or exchange traded funds  allow investors to easily invest in a given asset class by buying shares in a security that tracks the price of the underlying asset  The gold ETP market has grown over the last 12 years to rival other gold market sectors Made up predominantly of gold backed exchange traded funds  the gold ETP market is worth  81 2 billion  State Street s SPDR Gold Trust  known by the ticker GLD  accounts for nearly 60  of this market  representing the main liquidity hub within the gold ETP space Together  the top physically gold backed ETF products are worth over  59 billion  of which  48 billion is held by GLD In the first quarter of 2013  ETF holdings fell by 176 9 tonnes  The WGC argue that ETFs account for only a small proportion of total gold held by investors   i e  it is not ETF outflows which are driving the price On first impressions  one might assume the futures market is larger than the ETFs market  However  if you compare notional value of open interest in the future market with the market cap of gold ETPs   taken on 15th May 2013  the newer ETP market just outsizes the futures market with a value of  81 billion  compared to the futures market s  74 billion Refineries and supply to physical gold marketAfter the two gold market parts above  we arrive at the physical gold market which is supplied by a range of refineries around the world The top refineries in the world have a collective refining capacity of 8000 tonnes  the equivalent to  354 billion  This is assuming that they are able to operate at full capacity and are constantly processing given mine and scrap gold supply However  supply of gold bullion to the market is on average 4 400 tonnes per year  This physical gold supply is made up of approximately one third recycled gold  with the rest coming from active gold mines  Supply of gold has remained relatively flat since the start of the gold bull market  twelve years ago  meaning that the world s growing gold demand has to be serviced by this steady supplySee our infographic of the world s major gold refineries by capacity below It s interesting to note Switzerland dominating the gold refining scene  For a country which only officially left the gold standard in 2000 and was the epitome of sound money until quite recently  this is perhaps unsurprising Within the constituency of physical gold suppliers  Switzerland s Valcambi dominates the gold refining market  followed by Metalor and Rand which are both about half the size  Metalor is also Swiss based  with South Africa s famous Rand Refinery continuing to hold a position amongst the most noteworthy refineries The top three refineries in the world account for over 30  of total annual capacity  of those refineries studied Together these three refineries account for 2 650 tonnes or 32  of global gold refining capacity  Valcambi alone represents over 16  of global gold refining capacity and 28  of the capacity of the top nine refineries It is important to note the lack of mining and refining information in areas such as South America and China   hence why we don t mention refineries from these areas At first glance the gold production capacity from refineries appears to more than match the value of assets traded in the futures and ETPs markets  The nature of trading in these markets is more difficult to compare though  and the paper markets are where the greatest daily volumes occur After looking at the size of the relative gold market constituent parts  we need to look deeper to establish where the gold price really gets set and how this happens The physical market  although larger  with its lower turnover and churn is less relevant at this time  with gold prices being set in the paper markets of COMEX  GLD et al We are thus focused upon COMEX and GLD  the largest liquidity hubs in their respective markets  How do their trading volumes compare In the last week  the value of the  gold  traded on the COMEX  far exceeded that on the GLD   by over 20 times in fact To put this paper trading into perspective  the annual capacity of refineries is  374 billion  Therefore the last week s gold trading volumes on COMEX were equivalent to 50  of total annual refinery capacity  Half the physical gold that could possibly be refined in a year was traded in paper form this week So  whilst the notional value of open interest on the world s major futures markets is comparable to the market cap of the gold ETP industry  the volumes traded at the major two liquidity hubs within these different market segments is noticeably different The dollar value of trading volume at COMEX is far greater than its largest ETF competitor  GLD  meaning that COMEX continues to hold its place as the largest and most sophisticated meeting place for buyers and sellers to express their gold price opinions  in the form of bids and offers  on what the price should be COMEX remains the beating heart of gold price discovery Questions being raised about COMEXGold futures contracts are referred to as  paper gold  because the size of this market is said to be over 100 times larger than physical gold available  As we said previously  open interest on the COMEX  at the time of writing  accounted for over 85  of demand on the gold futures market  so COMEX receives the most examination here In theory investors are able to take delivery of the futures contract on expiry  although few do  instead choosing to roll the contract This may not be a bad thing as there is currently only 6 million troy ounces of eligible gold in the COMEX depositories  Whilst these gold inventories would allow delivery against all the May contracts currently traded on COMEX it is only enough to allow delivery against 33  of the June contracts  Contracts spanning May through until August represent 31 million troy ounces of gold  of which less than 5  of these could be delivered upon at current COMEX depository holdings Much of the paragraph above assumes futures holders taking delivery of contracts on a larger scale than they currently do  Even so  the fact remains that all the long positions on COMEX cannot be settled in gold This may be something that is bothering investors  despite there being few as deeply liquid and efficient market alternatives for large institutional investors There has been some attention paid to the scale and pace of draw downs of COMEX inventories  JP Morgan and Scotia Mocatta have seen the largest outflows of bullion in their repositories  Compared to withdrawals at JP Morgan s storage facilities of 1 2 million in the first 3 months of 2013  Scotia Mocatta s drainage of 650 000 ounces seems less remarkable in comparison  Until these recent drawdowns eligible gold stocks at COMEX had been increasing The speed and acuteness of recent drawdowns in COMEX inventories   over 2 million ounces since the beginning of the year   suggests that traders are increasingly standing for delivery of their futures position  It is argued that these investors are not exiting the gold market  but simply converting their efficiently entered paper position into physical form As notable hedge fund manager  Kyle Bass  once explained  if the notional value of open interest at COMEX is too large compared to physical bullion lying in the COMEX warehouses  then  you go get your gold   It s a confidence game  like most financial markets In the next few weeks we will look at how sustainable COMEX s hegemony is  but for now those are the major sections of the global gold market where COMEX remains the Everest for setting the gold price ,2013-05-19,Jan Skoyles,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unveiling-the-gold-market’s-working-parts-167443,167443
145363,366878,STT,If Yield Goes Significantly Higher The Market Will Freak Out,opinion,If yields on U S  Treasury bonds keep rising  things are going to get very messy  As I write this  the yield on 10 year U S  Treasures has risen to 2 51 percent  If that keeps going up  it is going to be like a mile wide lawnmower blade devastating everything in its path  Ben Bernanke s super low interest rate policies have systematically pushed investors into stocks and real estate over the past several years because there were few other places where they could get decent returns  As this trade unwinds  and it will likely not be in an orderly fashion   we are going to see unprecedented carnage  Stocks  ETFs  home prices and municipal bonds will all be devastated  And of course that will only be the beginning  What we are ultimately looking at is a sell off very similar to 2008  only this time we will have to deal with rising interest rates at the same time  The conditions for a  perfect storm  are rapidly developing  and if something is not done we could eventually have a credit crunch unlike anything that we have ever seen before in modern times  At the moment  perhaps the most important number in the financial world is the yield on 10 year U S  Treasuries  A lot of investors are really concerned about how rapidly it has been rising  For example  Patrick Adams  a portfolio manager at PVG Asset Management  was quoted in  as saying the following on Friday     I am watching the 10 year U S  bond   says Adams   It has to stabilize  If the yield goes significantly higher the market is going to freak out   If interest rates keep rising  it is going to have a dramatic effect throughout the economy  In an article that he just posted   explained some of the things that we might soon see    The wheels fall off the entire financialized debtocracy wagon once yields rise  There s nothing mysterious about this  1  As interest rates yields rise  all the existing bonds paying next to nothing plummet in market value 2  As mortgage rates rise  there s nobody left who can afford Housing Bubble 2 0 prices  so home prices fall off a cliff 3  Once you can get 5   yield on cash again  few people are willing to risk capital in the equities markets in the hopes that they can earn more than 5  yield before the next crash wipes out 40  of their equity 4  As asset classes decline  lenders are wary of loaning money against these assets  if the collateral for the loan  real estate  bonds  stocks  etc   are in a waterfall decline  no sane lender will risk capital on a bet that the collateral will be sufficient to cover losses should the borrower default  In addition  rapidly rising interest rates would throw the municipal bond market into absolute chaos  In fact  according to   nearly 2 billion dollars worth of municipal bond sales were postponed on Thursday because of rising rates    The possibility of rising interest rates rocked the U S  municipal bond market on Thursday  with prices plunging in secondary trade  investors selling off the debt  money pouring out of mutual funds and issuers postponing nearly  2 billion in new sales   The market got crushed   said Daniel Berger  an analyst at Municipal Market Data  a unit of Thomson Reuters  about the widespread sell off  We are rapidly moving into unprecedented territory  Nobody is quite sure what comes next  One financial professional says that municipal bond investors  are in for the shock of their lives      Muni bond investors are in for the shock of their lives   said financial advisor Ric Edelman   For the past 30 years there hasn t been interest rate risk   That risk can be extreme  A one point rise in the interest rate could cut 10 percent of the value of a municipal bond with a longer duration  he said  Many retail buyers  though  are not ready for the change and  when it starts  it will be too late for them to react   he said  adding that he was encouraging investors to look at their portfolio allocation and make changes to protect themselves from interest rate risks now  Rising interest rates are playing havoc with other financial instruments as well  For example  it appears that the ETF market may already be broken  Just check out the chaos that     The selling also caused disruptions in the plumbing behind several ETFs  Citigroup stopped accepting orders to redeem underlying assets from ETF issuers  after one trading desk reached its allocated risk limits  One Citi trader emailed other market participants to say   We are unable to take any more redemptions today       a very rare occurrence due to capital requirements we are maxed out on the amount of collateral we have out   State Street said it would stop accepting cash redemption orders for municipal bond products from dealers  Tim Coyne  global head of ETF capital markets at State Street  said his company had contacted participants  to say we were not going to do any cash redemptions today   But he added that redemptions  in kind  were still taking place  These are the kinds of things that you would expect to see at the beginning of a financial panic  And when there is fear in the marketplace  credit can dry up really quickly  So are we headed for a major liquidity crisis  Well  that is what  believes is happening    The early stage of any liquidity crisis is a mad dash for cash  especially by all of the leveraged speculators  Anything that can be sold is sold  As I scan the various markets  all I can find is selling  Stocks  commodities  and equities are all being shed at a rapid pace  and that s the first clue that we are not experiencing sector rotation or other artful portfolio dodging designed to move out of one asset class into another  say  from equities into bonds   The bursting of the  has the potential to plunge our financial system into a crisis that would be even worse than we experienced back in 2008  Unfortunately  as  recently noted  the bond market is dominated by just a few major players    The Fed  the ECB  the Bank of England  the Bank of Japan  et al  own  10 trillion in bonds  China  the petro powers  et al  own another  10 trillion  Between them they have locked up  20 trillion  equal to roughly 25pc of global GDP  They are the market  That is why Fed taper talk has become so neuralgic  and why we all watch Chinese regulators for every clue on policy  This is one of the reasons why I write  so much  China has a tremendous amount of leverage over the global financial system  If China starts selling bonds at about the same time that the Fed stops buying bonds we could see a shift of unprecedented proportions  Sadly  most Americans have absolutely no idea how vulnerable the financial system is  Most Americans have absolutely no idea that our system of finance is a house of cards built on a foundation of risk  debt and leverage  Most Americans have complete and total faith that our leaders know what they are doing and are fully capable of keeping our financial system from collapsing  In the end  most Americans are going to be bitterly  bitterly disappointed ,2013-06-23,Michael T.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO  June 16  Reuters    The euro tumbled to a three week
low on Thursday  with a break through key support pointing to
the risk of further losses  as worries grew that Greece s debt
crisis may be spiralling out of control as a new bailout scheme
to keep the country from defaulting remained elusive  while
protests against austerity turned violent in Athens 
 Comments from European Central Bank policy maker Nout
Wellink  reported in a Dutch newspaper  that the European
bailout fund should be doubled helped to trigger a wave of
stop loss selling orders around  1 4150 in a market already
frayed by a rise in yields on Greek bonds as well as equivalent
Portuguese and Irish spreads 
  Investors are getting worried that policymakers can t
agree on measures for Greece  Even though the Greek economy
accounts for only a small part of the euro zone economy  it
could affect the whole European financial system if it is
considered to be in default   said Kimihiko Tomita  forex
manager at State Street 
 Concerns about possible strains in the banking sector are
raising speculation that European banks could face difficulty
in dollar funding  with tension already palpable in the
currency swap market 
 The one year euro dollar currency basis swap spread  the
cost of swapping euro into dollar for a year  widened to 34
basis points   the widest in three months from
around 23 basis points on Wednesday 
 Though it was still smaller than a peak of around 55 basis
points after the first Greek debt crisis last year  and 120
basis points after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 
traders said market players are increasingly on edge about
potential fallout from the debt crisis  which seemed close to a
solution  even if a temporary one  just a few weeks ago 
  It seems everyone is a bit scared  as no one knows who
would finance it  if the euro aid fund has to be doubled     
Speculators  hedge funds and all other investors are offloading
now   said a trader at a Japanese bank 
 The euro fell to as low as  1 4093   its lowest in
three weeks  having broken several support levels including its
100 day moving average at  1 4152 and the 76 4 percent
retracement of its May 23 June 7 rally  which stood around
 1 4135  making a return to a May 23 low around  1 3967
increasingly realistic 
  Based on our monitoring of institutional investors  they
are still very long in the euro  So there s a chance that more
euro unwinding could be kicking in   Tomita added 
 As the euro sags  the dollar index  rose to a
three week high of 75 886  extending gains on top of a 1 7
percent jump on Wednesday    its biggest one day percentage
gain since August 2010 
 The dollar looked to be benefiting from risk aversion 
making gains even as U S  Treasury yields fell to 2 94 percent
  near a six month low hit earlier this month  on
worries about banks and following disappointing U S 
manufacturing and housing data 
 The dollar also held firm against safe haven currencies
such as the Swiss franc and yen  It kept Wednesday s hefty
gains and traded at 0 8535 francs   putting further
distance from a record trough near 0 8320 marked earlier in the
month 
 For the Swiss franc  the focus is on the Swiss National
Bank  which is expected to keep rates on hold at 0 25 percent
on Thursday  Traders are looking to comments from the bank on
the recent strength of the franc 
 Analysts expect the bank to raise rates by 25 basis points
in September and again in December  but the SNB has been wary
of raising its target for 3 month Swiss franc LIBOR  for fear
of pushing the franc up still further against the euro and the
dollar   ID nL9E7F6040 
 Against the yen  the greenback flirted with a two week high
of 81 06 yen hit on Wednesday  with many players looking to
whether it can stay above 80 89 yen  the base of the Ichimoku
cloud 
 Commodity currencies like the Australian dollar also lost
ground to the U S  dollar  with even hawkish comments from the
Reserve Bank of Australia on Wednesday providing little support
to the Aussie  
 It fell 0 4 percent to a three week low of  1 0517

 LONDON  June 29  Reuters    Equities gained strongly and the
euro rose on Wednesday as investors bet on the ability of
Greece s government to pass new austerity measures designed to
prevent the country from going bankrupt 	
 Wall Street looked set to join in the rally 	
 A positive vote later in the day is essential for Greece to
obtain new funding from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund to help to manage its huge debt burden 	
  A lot of work has been done behind the scenes to ensure
that the proposals get passed  and that optimism is getting
reflected   said Graham Bishop  equity strategist at RBS 	
 European shares were up 1 5 percent heading for
their third day of gains in a row 	
 Globally  the MSCI all country world stock index
 gained 0 9 percent and Japan s Nikkei 
closed up 1 5 percent 	
 In a boost to embattled Prime Minister George Papandreou 
one of three rebel deputies from his ruling Socialist party
backtracked and said he would support the austerity plan 	
 Meanwhile  Greek central bank Governor and European Central
Bank policymaker George Provopoulos warned that a  no  vote
would be  suicide  for Greece 	
 Greece has around 345 billion euros worth of outstanding
government debt  Its 10 year bonds are yielding
more than 16 5 percent  indicating that future borrowing costs
would be prohibitive 	
 The fear among policy makers and investors is that a default
by Greece would rapidly spread to other peripheral euro zone
economies  into banks through losses  and ultimately across the
world in the same way as the 2007 8 credit crisis 	
 There remains little confidence  however  that Wednesday s
vote will do much more than ease the situation temporarily 	
  The Greek plan is largely expected to be passed by its
parliament  But even when this hurdle is cleared the long term
outlook remains unclear   said Kimihiko Tomita  head of foreign
exchange at State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo 	
 
 EURO FIRMS	
 The euro shrugged off earlier weakness to stand 0 4 percent
higher against the dollar at just above  1 44  	
 It was lifted by both the prospect of a Greek  yes  vote and
prospects for further interest rate hikes in the euro zone 
Comments by European Central Bank President Jean Claude Trichet
were interpreted by markets as signalling a July interest rate
rise  	
 Traders said a positive outcome in the vote could push the
euro towards  1 4500  though concerns about whether Greece can
implement the measures would remain 
     If the Greece vote is passed there is some upside potential
for the euro  though this is more based on weakness in the U S 
economy and expectations for a euro zone rate hike next week  
said Mic Ingenuus  currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen 	
 Core euro zone government bond prices fell and demand for
peripheral debt rose 	
  A relief rally will be short lived but relief there will
be   said Nick Stamenkovic  rate strategist at RIA Capital

   Dollar benefits from renewed euro pressure
   Aussie jumps after firm jobs data
   Commodity currencies resilient even after China rate rise

 By Hideyuki Sano and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO SYDNEY  July 7  Reuters    The euro stabilised in Asia
on Thursday but remained vulnerable as worries about Europe s
sovereign debt problems could take centre stage again after a
widely expected interest rate hike by the European Central Bank
later in the day 	
 Concern that Greece s debt crisis would spread to other
highly indebted peripheral euro zone countries flared up this
week after Moody s slashed its rating for Portugal to junk
status   	
  Ireland could get downgraded to junk status too 
which would hurt the euro  Countries like Spain and Italy have
relatively high ratings despite rises in their bond yields and
they could face more downgrades   said Kimihiko Tomita  forex
manager at State Street 	
 Yield spreads on Italian bonds over German bunds
have soared in recent weeks and many traders say the euro s
potential downside will look bigger if the ECB raises rates on
Thursday 	
  Now with euro peripheral contagion back in rage  the ECB
meeting is almost relegated to the status of a sideshow     the
potential for Mr Trichet to do or say anything that will
immediately propel the euro significantly higher is considerably
diminished   BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note   	
In fact  if anything  a softening in ECB President
Jean Claude Trichet s hawkish stance  or even a lack of more
hawkish comments  could further weigh on the euro  traders said 
 	
  If Trichet s comments just underline expectations of
gradual tightening in the future  the market may be disappointed
and sell the euro  said Katsunori Kitakura  chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Trust Bank 	
 The euro was last at  1 4335   having plumbed a trough
around  1 4286 overnight  Support is seen at the session low  a
level representing a 61 8 percent retracement of a June 27 to
July 4 rally  	
A break of that could see the single currency return to
 1 4213  the 76 4 percent level  A breach of its upward sloping
trendline support since late May  now at around  1 4175  could
add to bearish sentiment 	
 Still  analysts don t expect the euro to fall too sharply in
the months ahead  underpinned by higher interest rates  a
Reuters poll showed   	
Analysts in the survey see the euro at  1 3900 in a year s
time  See for the latest Reuters forex poll   	
Against the safe haven Swiss franc   the euro
reached a low around 1 1958 francs on Wednesday before
recovering a bit to last stand at 1 2029  It was  however  not
far off a record low near 1 1800 set recently   	
The dollar benefited from the euro s woes  rising against a
basket of major currencies  The dollar index climbed to
around 75 000  pulling further away from a one month low of
74 133 set earlier in the week   	
Against the yen  it was at 80 97   staying in a
well worn range roughly between 79 80 and 81 30   	
Commodity currencies fared surprisingly well in the face of
renewed pressure on the euro and China s interest rate hike   	
 
 TIGHTENING CYCLE	
 China raised rates for the third time this year  but
analysts suggested it was close to  or even at the end  of its
tightening cycle  There was also some optimism that it would not
be threatened by a hard landing   	
 While the euro is suffering on the back of such negative
news flow  unlike the 2010 episodes of euro zone debt woes  the
risk aversion impact appears to be getting increasingly narrow  
noted Frank Peter  strategist at Societe Generale    	
 Interestingly  even with the announcement of another China
policy rate hike  USD  JPY and CHF gains against the commodity
bloc currencies were marginal or non existent   he added   	
Indeed  the Australian dollar recovered from a dip
to one week lows around  1 0655 to last stand near  1 0730 
while the New Zealand currency at  0 8262  was not far
off a 30 year peak of  0 8332 set earlier this week   	
The Aussie extended its gains further after data showed
Australian employment rose by more than expected in June

145384,366899,STT,3 Successful ETFs That Should Pique Your Interest In 2013,opinion,Why do some ETFs succeed and others fail  The question certainly seems harmless enough  What s more  this was the topic of my presentation at the Global Indexing   ETFs Conference in Phoenix yesterday afternoon As I prepared to speak  I found myself questioning the nature of success  Should I link success to risk adjusted returns  Should I talk about the ETFs that raised the most assets in the shortest time span  Would it make sense to praise the vehicles that had the most  buzz  in the institutional money management arena I brought a yellow pad with pages of  talking points  up to the podium  but I didn t use one tenth of the material  Instead  I began to chat in a casual manner What makes anything or anyone successful  If you re talking about a person  a product  a business  a team or even a country  the key ingredients are the same  One part innovation  one part motivation and one part  right place  right time  Think about the United States of America itself  Success is directly attributable to a radical new idea   individual rights rather than the divine rights of kings  Unfairly taxed settlers must have been exceptionally determined to risk life and limb  battling against the well organized British army  The fact that soon to be Americans were over matched didn t seem to matter  Simply stated  it was the right time and place for highly motivated folks to launch an innovative and brand new system of government If we apply the same criteria to the world of ETFs  we recognize that an excellent idea must be accompanied by great timing and phenomenal fund provider commitment  It s not enough to open up shop and declare your  Small Cap Emerging Markets Materials and Infrastructure ETF  a masterpiece  rather  the offering must be one that will endure Below  I compiled a number of new ETFs that deserve a  most successful  moniker  Each investment possibility came to market within the last 12 15 months  More importantly  you won t find any of them on a  Death Watch  list in 2013 1  SPDR Barclays Capital Short Term High Yield Bond  SJNK   Before March of 2012  if you wanted access to a diversified basket of short term high yield corporates  you had to go with a single year in the Guggenheim BulletShares series  Not that there s anything wrong with that  On the other hand  the folks at State Street designed SJNK with greater trade ability and one stop access to the asset class in mind   Can  520 million inflow in 8 months be wrong  Certainly  Yet SJNK s 338 holdings with an average maturity of just 3 5 years makes a 5 2  SEC yield reasonably compelling   Note  At present  investors are paying a 50 basis point premium over the net asset value    2  WisdomTree Emerging Market Corporate Bond  EMCB   Some people may be thinking  do we really need another bond fund  Couldn t you just use PowerShares Emerging Market Sovereign  PCY  or iShares Emerging Market Bond  EMB    There s certainly a case to be made that country debt is the only bond exposure one needs out of Asia  Latin America and the Middle East  On the flip side  the yields on developed world country debt   America  Britain  Germany  Japan   are rather unappealing  Unless your pursuit is the return of your capital alone  1 2  from iShares 7 10 Year Treasury  IEF  may not cut it   EMCB is the original dollar denominated emerging market corporate bond fund  The fund of 30 holdings offers an average maturity of 7 years with a 4 1  distribution yield  Granted  a 0 6  expense ratio is a disappointment  Nevertheless  those who wish to expand their income asset horizons into corporate bonds tied to emerging economies now have the opportunity to do so   3  Emerging Markets MSCI Minimum Volatility Fund  EEMV   Low volatility funds may lose some of their luster in a raging stock bull  But don t expect investors to abandon  New Normal  thinking anytime soon  In fact  as long as there is a place for ETFs  as long as people want  trade able  alternatives to buy n hold mutual funds  expect money managers to employ the revolutionary concept   The iShares launch of EEMV actually occurred in late 2011  In one year s time  EEMV has amassed  675 million in assets under management  And why not  Here is a fund with a reasonable cost of ownership  net expense 0 25    less beta risk than Vanguard Emerging Markets  VWO   and a greater focus on non cyclicals like consumer staples  Disclosure  Gary Gordon  MS  CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial  Inc   a

690 00  EUR 1 285 27 and GBP 1 043 21 per ounce The precious metals crept higher yesterday and closed with very slight gains for both gold and silver  Gold closed up 0 22  or  3 80 to  1698 00  Silver closed with a marginal gain of 0 12    up 4 cents to  32 21 oz Prices crept gradually higher in Asian trading prior to some retrenchment in early European trading U K  inflation held at the highest since May in November as higher food  electricity and gas costs kept consumer price growth above the Bank of England s target The fastest price rises were seen in the cost of fruit  bread and cereals  as well as in energy bills  the Office for National Statistics  ONS  said  Inflation is now expected by many investors and economists to creep up further next year as further increases in electricity and gas prices take effect Many traders are on the sideline as trading slows down prior to Christmas  The focus remains on U S  lawmakers attempts to cobble together a deal to avert the  fiscal cliff   There is optimism that a deal can be done to avert fiscal disaster While this may be the case in the short term   another short term political panacea which fails to address the very poor deep rooted structural fiscal challenges may lead to an even greater fiscal disaster in the course of President Obama s second term The fundamentals which have led to another annual gain in 2012  8  in dollar terms  remain in place Ultra loose monetary policies from the U S  Federal Reserve  the Bank of England and other central banks will provide support  as currency debasement and rising inflation leads to continuing demand for bullion  These fundamentals are leading to broad based global demand for gold   from retail investors to institutions and pension funds  Japanese pension funds are increasingly looking at gold according to an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning  Chart Diversification into gold is taking place in order to protect against sovereign risk  debasement of currency risk and inflation risk In March 2012  Okayama Metal   Machinery became the first Japanese pension fund to make public purchases of gold  in a sign of dwindling faith in paper currencies  Okayama manages pension funds for about 260 small and mid sized companies in the Okayama area  By diversifying currencies  we aim to reduce risks associated with them   said Yoshi Kiguchi  the fund s chief investment officer   Yields become stable if you put small amounts into as many types of holdings as possible  Of its 40 billion yen   477 million  in assets  the fund has invested around  500 million  600 million in gold  he said Initially  the fund aims to keep about 1 5  of its total assets of Y40bn   500m  in bullion backed exchange traded funds  according to chief investment officer Yoshisuke Kiguchi  who said he was diversifying into gold to  escape sovereign risk  Other pension funds in Japan are following their lead according to the Wall Street Journal Japanese pension funds are diversifying into gold  largely to mitigate the damage from possible market shocks  Japanese pension funds invest mainly in domestic stocks and bonds  Until recently  none have looked to gold or other physical assets For example  Japan s Government Pension Investment Fund  the world s largest public pension  held 64  of its assets in domestic bonds  11  in domestic stocks  9 0  in international bonds  and 12  in international stocks  as of end September  The remainder were in short term assets This strategy has produced meager returns at a time when bonds offer historically low yields and the stock market has stagnated Worse yet  when crises have roiled the markets  big funds such as the GPIF have seen red  The GPIF lost 7 6  in the 2008 fiscal year  when the global financial crisis struck  and a less painful 0 3  in the 2010 fiscal year  when the eurozone debt crisis spooked markets Gold  whose price movement isn t historically correlated with those of stocks or bonds  can protect portfolios from being damaged too badly in times of market stress  investment managers say  Low interest rates also justify holding non yielding gold in place of cash Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation said it has secured more than Y2 billion in investments from two pension funds for a gold fund it started in March Gold is also used as a hedge against inflation  which is becoming a bigger concern as global central banks buy ever more bonds  market watchers say The Bank of Japan has increased its purchases of Japanese government debt from the market and is under political pressure to do more  Shinzo Abe  Japan s next prime minister  has said he wants the central bank to employ  unlimited easing measures  to achieve a 2  inflation target  Responding to inflation is becoming one issue   said Hiroaki Nakaoka  sales manager for SPDR ETF Japan at State Street Global Advisors  Japan  Co Higher inflation could drive up interest rates and erode the value of the Japanese government bonds in which pension funds have invested most of their money In some ways  Japanese pension funds are merely tracking a trend that has already been seen in other developed markets  industry watchers say  Gold s potential to offset inflation linked losses has already prompted some U S  and European pension funds to buy small volumes  The Teacher Retirement System of Texas pension trust fund  for example  held  235 million of SPDR Gold Shares GLD  0 19  out of its total investment net value of  111 1 billion  as of end August The emergence of gold exchange traded funds has enabled pension funds to invest in gold without holding the physical product  Some funds restrict themselves from investing in physical assets  The first ETF backed by actual gold was introduced in Japan in June 2008 ETFs  opened the door  to investment in gold  said Tetsu Emori  chief fund manager at Astmax Investment Management Inc   which manages  70 billion in assets  Roughly 60  of its portfolio is invested in commodities  with gold accounting for the largest portion In March 2011  Mizuho Trust   Banking Co  started incorporating gold in a package product for pension funds that invests in various assets  including gold ETFs  Gold accounts for about 3  of the package  The product has attracted  180 billion in investment from about 200 pension funds The vast majority of pension funds continue to shy away from gold  an investment that offers no yield and  in the case of physical gold  actually costs money to store But the potential for market turmoil and expectations of inflation could change that  industry experts say  The global pension market is of a huge scale   with the Japanese pension market alone worth some  3 4 trillion    Even a small allocation by pension funds internationally to gold would result in a significant new source of demand which could be a new fundamental factor which propels prices higher in the coming years

145386,366901,STT,Managing Risk In Fixed Income Markets ,opinion,At any given time  almost USD 100 trillion is outstanding on the global bond market  This is roughly twice the size of the world s equity markets combined  amounting to almost 150  of global GDP  Bonds and other fixed income instruments are the foundation of how much of the world s economy is funded   From central banks to financial institutions  insurers and more   everyone has their eyes firmly glued to even the most minute of movements in these markets  James Carville  former political advisor to President Clinton  once said   I used to think that if there was reincarnation  I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a  400 baseball hitter  But now I would like to come back as the bond market  You can intimidate everybody    The very word  bond  conjures up an idea of how these instruments were perceived in the market  Bonds were typically seen as being the ultimate safe haven instruments for a portfolio  but following the near existential events of 2007 have showed investors otherwise  Research shows that    Collateralized debt obligations  CDOs   once a money making machine on Wall Street  have been responsible for  542 billion of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions since 2007   By magnitude  this would be similar to losing the entire Deutsche B rse   To learn more about managing risk in fixed income portfolios  I spoke to Dr  Kevin Anderson  Global CIO  Fixed Income and Currency  at SSgA  State Street Global Advisors    a firm with USD 23 4 trillion in assets under custody and administration  and USD 2 1 trillion under management   Kevin is a Senior Managing Director of SSgA and Global CIO of Fixed Income and Currency  He is responsible for all fixed income and currency strategies and products  Kevin holds a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Southampton and he graduated with a BSc Honours degree in Mathematical Physics from the University of Edinburgh in 1994   AllAboutAlpha com  What are the key risks and mitigation strategies in government and other sovereign debt   Dr  Anderson  Before we make an investment and look at risks  we have to look at what our clients want in terms of investment outcomes and their own risk profiles  Linking that to government bonds and the treasury curve for example  we see that pension fund clients will have long dated liabilities and potentially will need to match longer duration  They have a different risk profile to short dated insurance or other participants  It s important to look at the risk of the instrument and investment in context of client s needs and strategies  Before you think about the alpha  you have to think about the client s beta   We hold government debt for principally for those classes of client  defined benefit pension funds  institutions such as central banks  insurance firms and so on  Assessing the interest rate risk is still the key when looking at the full or partial duration of those instruments   If we look at sovereign paper  recent experiences in Europe have illustrated the creation of the  sovereign risk premium   Investors who previously thought that sovereigns were a quasi risk free asset have been challenged in that respect  Domestic local currency sovereign debt is certainly not risk free  It very much depends on the willingness and ability of the sovereign to pay back its debt  Sovereign debt is reasonably unique in that there are no underlying assets one can claim unlike corporate bonds  Assessing that idiosyncratic risk premium is very important  For example  in our more alpha focused mandates  research has been directed at assessing risk between the fundamentals between eurozone states   AllAboutAlpha com  What are the key risks and mitigation strategies in corporate debt   Dr  Anderson  Corporate bonds have additional risk factors  You have the underlying rate profile and the position of that issue from a particular issuer on the yield curve  and how that impacts the interest rate profile  However  there are a number of other factors one should consider   We are certainly taking a view on a sector basis  with utilities  industrials and financials at the top most level  Looking down beneath that  we will see banks  brokerage  insurance  different types of utility companies  autos and so forth  Those sector based calls are important from a macro and cyclical sense  Understanding your relative exposure to those macro factors is important   Another important element is the idiosyncratic risk profile of the issuer  A corporate bond is ultimate a long term loan structured in the form of a bond  Corporate entities are not default remote and are not guaranteed to pay back their debts  You have to look at the balance sheets of the corporates in your portfolio  and understand how that balance sheet looks from a bond holder perspective rather than a shareholder perspective  This can introduce in macro considerations such as concentration  sectoral risk   Liquidity in corporate bond markets has been challenging this year  Many large trading bank models are trading  and flow trading has been transformed  Ongoing regulatory changes aiming to increase transparency will also create changes in this market   AllAboutAlpha com  What are your views on the risks presented by CD instruments   Dr  Anderson  Key is to recognize who the issuer of the deposit is  At SSGA we manage traditional bond portfolios  typically over 1 year to maturity  and also have significant cash business  Here  we manage portfolios that look to provide market value cash or liquidity  It s incredibly important to understand the credit worthiness of the investments  the issuer s own status and so on   AllAboutAlpha com  What are your views on the risks presented by MBS  CDO and other fixed income derivatives   Dr  Anderson  Securities like MBS have a prepayment risk in their profile  There is always the ability for mortgage owners  who are ultimately behind the instrument  to refinance and prepay their mortgages  This gives mortgages a convexity risk feature which is different to most securities in issue  This has to be assessed against interest rate volatility as it can affect not just risk  but also alpha   When one talks about MBS  CDO  ABS  all of those are part of a rich and expansive set of securities  MBS includes the Ginnie Mae issues in the US  agency mortgage backs  which are exclusive guaranteed by the US Government  and Fannie Mae   Freddie Mac which are implicitly guaranteed  In totality  those mortgage backed pools of issuance account for approximately one fifth or so of the whole US investment grade bond market  They are a significant part of many US Dollar investor exposures  especially if they are buying in aggregate   When one looks at ABS  there is more of an issuer profile to take into account as well as an interest rate differentiation profile given the type of cash flow the instrument may generate over its term  You also have to look at the underlying pools of assets and collateral backing the issue  These risks must be compensated for in the price   Transparency is paramount  We have to make sure that we have sufficient transparency in the investments we are making  to be able to manage risk for our clients  CDOs and tranches thereof are certainly not part of mainstream institutional investor portfolios  mainly because of the risk preferences of clients  and our own specialisations  These are specialised and complex instruments We have seen a continued push for drive from our investors  especially since central bank interventions in markets have pushed yields lower  We still have short term memory of the financial crisis and are nowhere near the stage where investors would look for yield  at any cost   Investors have therefore moved away from instruments with a lack of transparency   AllAboutAlpha com  What are your views on the risks presented by high yield and non investment grade instruments   Dr  Anderson  We invest in high yield both in the European and US markets  One of our very large Exchange Traded Funds is a US High Yield product  we re there buying the market   When one buys an ETF in fixed income  one cannot replicate every issue in the market and so one must look carefully at the risks involved  The assessment of risk in terms of high yield has additional dimensions  You have sectoral risk  the nature of the issuer  idiosyncratic risks due to the companies themselves and more   The other risks are due to covenants  For example  there are a fair percentage of these instruments which are callable bonds  These present the risk where an investor could call the bonds back with a value of 100 if they reach a price over par  Given the current rally in high yield  there is a significantly greater call risk in the market  Bonds are behaving with a slightly different convexity  giving a negative convexity rather than others in the market   AllAboutAlpha com  What are your views on the environment for price discovery and rating for fixed income instruments and portfolios   Dr  Anderson  Price discovery is a function of the execution venues that one has  and which determine the price at which the market is willing to buy and sell  In equities this is somewhat straightforward  given that they are traded on exchanges  and those exchanges are an important source of price discovery and liquidity  The fixed income market  with the exception of fixed income futures and derivatives  are primarily traded OTC or between counterparts  the main players being large regional and global banks  The price discovery process in an OTC market is somewhat more challenging than equity markets  There may not be the same availability of pricing at any given time  There have been developments  principally around electronic trading networks  These have significantly improved price visibility  We do a substantial volume of our trading across these networks and find they allow for substantially better discovery of pricing  Our aim being to get best execution for our clients  Looking at ratings  Although we have our own team of research analysts to do fundamental analysis of credits and corporates  they also determine  with our portfolio managers  the relative value between issuers  Rating agencies are a very prevalent part of the landscape  and pay an important role  They provide an additional source of analysis  These agencies should make sure they are operating with transparent business models  and with mechanisms to ensure their research is objective and can be independently assessed  In the mid 80 s there were a greater number of smaller ratings agencies  Significant consolidation followed  and now we have a small number of dominant agencies  Post crisis a number of new agencies have emerged  I think this greater number will help increase transparency   as long as quality is maintained  There are also regulatory changes coming on board in respect of ratings  It s important these changes continue to allow a common platform to be understood  and still allow for a high quality of analysis and research to be conducted   One of the important aspects of rating agencies that we shouldn t ignore is that many indexes and benchmarks have rules determined by ratings  You may have an investment grade benchmark  which may mean you are not allowed to own high yield  This determination of an investment grade benchmark is not made by our own research analysts  but an independent rating agencies or a group of them together  Rating agency output is still very prevalent in many types of financial contracts   What does this mean for investors and risk managers  Investors in equities and other asset classes are frequently kept on their toes with major events ranging from frauds such as Madoff  with an impact potentially over  50 billion  to collapses such as Lehman  who collapsed with assets of USD 691 billion   WaMu  who collapsed with assets of USD 327 billion  and Worldcom  who collapsed with assets of just over USD 100 billion   Even investors in commodities have to face real time geopolitical and climate uncertainty   The bond market has long been the elephant in the room  and events in the financial markets since 2007  including the European sovereign debt crisis  QE and recent LIBOR scandal  have shown that investors and risk managers need to carefully understand the risks these instruments carry ,2012-12-23,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/managing-risk-in-fixed-income-markets-148529,148529
145388,366903,STT,Consumer Confidence Composite Turns Down,opinion,The most recent release of the Conference Board s consumer confidence index showed a steep decline not only in current sentiment but also in future expectations   Econoday summed it up well  The consumer confidence report shows hard evidence that the fiscal cliff is hurting the consumer s assessment of economic conditions  The index fell 6 4 points this month to 65 1 with weakness centered in the post cliff outlook  that is the expectations component which plunged nearly 15 points to 66 5  The assessment of the present situation actually is up  rising nearly 5 1 2 points to 62 8 which is by far the best reading of the recovery And the assessment of the current jobs market is a highlight of the report with only 35 6 percent describing jobs as hard to get which is down sizably  nearly two percentage points from the prior month  More also describe current business conditions as good and fewer describe conditions as bad But what is bad is the outlook six months out where fewer see jobs rising and many more see jobs falling  More also see a decrease in their income ahead  at 18 7 percent vs November s 15 6 percent which is a big jump for this reading that underscores the fiscal cliff effect  However  it is not just the Conference Board s measure of consumer confidence that has turned down as of late   The chart below is a composite index of consumer and investor sentiment including Rasmussen  Bloomberg  State Street  and the University of Michigan polls along with the Conference Board s current and future expectations indexes What is clearly evident is that the impact of the worries over the fiscal cliff is weighing not only on the consumer sentiment but investor sentiment as well  This lack of conviction  despite the continued drumbeat from analysts calling for new market highs in 2013  has led to continued withdrawals from equity based mutual funds in recent weeks totaling in excess of  39 billion since the election  The question that remains is whether a resolution to the  fiscal cliff   in whatever form  will draw individual investors back into equity funds in the months to come   The drive for income  regardless of the inherent risks  has kept money flowing steadily into the fixed income funds  driving prices higher and yields lower  even while the media  and analysts  have continually warned of a debt bubble  These warnings have not deterred investors who continue to opt for yield  and perceived safety  over capital appreciation   The fears of hyperinflation due to QE programs from the Fed  economic collapse from Government debt loads and global concerns from the Eurozone  while all generally misplaced  continue to drive the  fear trade    This has led to a chase for gold  guns and yield   The inherent problem is that we have seen yield chases before which have all ended in disaster as with the  Nifty Fifty  in late 70 s  However  as with all things market related  the insanity can last far longer than most can imagine  Of course  this why investors continue to get swept from one bubble to the next  technology  housing and now   high yield bonds  each time believing that they will be smart enough to get out early  Unfortunately  they never are ,2012-12-28,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consumer-confidence-composite-turns-down-148970,148970

 MILAN  Oct 20  Reuters    The top shareholder in Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA has said the bank s general manager should have
more power  in a sign that hurt feelings continue in Turin over
the 2007 merger that created Italy s biggest retail bank 
 Angelo Benessia  chairman of Turin foundation Compagnia di
San Paolo  which has a 10 percent share in Intesa Sanpaolo  also
called on other non profit foundation shareholders to form
temporary coalitions to deal with issues 
 Turin leaders have been been fuming over the city s loss of
clout since Milan based Banca Intesa s takeover of Turin s
Sanpaolo IMI to form Intesa Sanpaolo  They have said they want
governance to be equally balanced between Milan and Turin
shareholders 
 Turin mayor Turin Mayor Sergio Chiamparino told Reuters 
last week that a more powerful general manager  would mean a
stronger retail unit  which he heads  This would translate more
lending to small and mid sized businesses around Turin and in
the rest of Italy  which is suffering its worst downturn since
World War Two  he said 
 It is the first sign of political manoeuvring ahead of the
expiration of management mandates  including that of Chief
Executive Corrado Passera  next spring 
  These comments by Benessia are part of the pre election
campaign for the supervisory and management boards   said an
analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity   This is more about
politics than business  
 When asked if the bank needed a general manager with strong
powers  Management Board Chairman Enrico Salza told reporters in
Rome   We already have one  
 The management issue has heightened since General Manager
Pietro Modiano  who had headed Sanpaolo IMI  quit in November
2008  He left because of reported tensions with Passera  the
former Intesa CEO  over a restructuring of the 5 400 branch
retail division Modiano headed 
 Intesa Sanpaolo is now headed by General Manager Francesco
Micheli  a Banca Intesa veteran 
 
 INFORMAL COALITIONS
 Turin Mayor Chiamparino said last week that the general
manager should have more authority 
  As far as I m concerned   there should be  at least an
autonomous general manager with definite powers   he said 
 Benessia  in an address to Compagnia di San Paolo over the
weekend that was published on its website  said that foundation
shareholders should form informal coalitions for one off events 
such as the election of bank boards 
 Italian non profits  including Compagnia di San Paolo  hold
about 26 percent of Intesa Sanpaolo shares  
 Benessia s comments come as Intesa Sanpaolo  Europe s
fourth biggest bank by market value  is looking to shore up its
capital ratios by listing  selling or carry out partnerships for
about 11 billion euros   16 billion  in non core assets 
  It s reasonable to expect that institutional investors will
be called on more and more to make use of the tools given them
by statute   Benessia said 
 As part of its capital increase plans  Intesa Sanpaolo has
reopened talks to sell its depositary bank to State Street Corp
  Il Messaggero newspaper reported on Tuesday without citing
sources 
 The Italian bank has put its price for the unit at about 1 8
billion euros  it said 
 Asked about the report  Passera told reporters in Rome   The
talks are going forward   He gave no details 
 Shares in Intesa Sanpaolo ended the day down 0 08 percent at
3 16 euros  almost in line with the DJ Stoxx banks index

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SYDNEY SINGAPORE  April 1  Reuters    The yen slid to a
10 month low against the euro and fell below its 200 day moving
average versus the dollar on Friday  poised for more weakness as
widening yield differences increased the appeal of using the yen
to fund investments in other currencies 	
 The yen came under renewed pressure after comments from a
U S  Federal Reserve official gave traders more reason to think
the Fed will raise interest rates before the Bank of Japan    	
underscoring the diverging outlook for their monetary policies 	
 The BOJ will likely lag behind the Fed and the European
Central Bank in raising interest rates  especially in the wake
of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan s
northeast 	
 Such market expectations have stirred talk of a revival in
the yen carry trade  which involves selling the low yielding yen
to fund investment in higher yielding currencies and assets 
 ID nL3E7EV00H 	
  The global economy is in relatively good shape  equities
are performing solidly and volatility has been low   said Koji
Fukaya  director of global foreign exchange research at Credit
Suisse Securities in Tokyo 	
  In this risk on environment  there is a growing contrast in
monetary policies among the G3  and that situation is likely
leading to some yen carry trades   Fukaya said  adding that the
dollar could rise to around 86 yen by the end of June 	
 The dollar rose above its 200 day moving average against the
yen at 83 63 yen for the first time since June  a sign that the
yen s uptrend may be coming to an end  	
 Since the Lehman crisis  the dollar has never risen more
than 4 yen above the 200 day moving average  said Masato Chin 
president of Chin Associates  adding that the next possible
target for the dollar is 4 yen above its moving average 	
 If the dollar rises above that level it would likely signal
that the yen has hit a historic peak with its rise in March 
Chin added 	
 The dollar was up 0 5 percent to 83 56 yen   It
touched a six week high of 83 748 yen on trading platform EBS
earlier  and the next major peak on daily charts is its
mid February peak of 83 98 yen  	
 The dollar tumbled to a post World War Two record low of
76 25 yen in March  as the yen surged on the back of market
speculation that Japanese investors may repatriate funds from
abroad after the earthquake 	
 There has been little sign that such repatriation has taken
place  and the yen later fell back after the Group of Seven
industrialised nations intervened jointly to sell the yen on
March 18  Japan conducted a total of 692 5 billion yen   8 4
billion  in FX intervention in March  the Ministry of Finance
said on Thursday  	
 	
 YEN S BROAD FALL	
 The yen fell broadly on the crosses  hitting an 11 month low
against the Australian dollar and its lowest in more than 10
months against the euro 	
 The single European currency rose as high as 118 675 yen 
 on trading platform EBS  the euro s highest since
against the yen since mid May 2010  The euro last stood at
118 40 yen  up 0 6 percent on the day 	
  The dollar gained a lift against the yen after the Wall
Street Journal reported that Minneapolis Federal Reserve
President Narayana Kocherlakota signaled the Fed could raise
interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point by the
end of the year   ID nN31167243 	
 A recent series of hawkish comments by Fed officials have
helped drive U S  Treasury yields higher this week and caused
the dollar s yield advantage over the yen to widen 	
 Still  not all market players are convinced that investors
have regained their appetite for carry trades just yet 	
 Kimihiko Tomita  head of foreign exchange at State Street
Global Markets in Tokyo  said there was little sign that global
investors have regained their appetite for carry trades    	
  What is happening now is just a reaction to the fact that
the yen had been bought without much meaning   Tomita said 
referring to the yen s surge in March that was partly driven by 
speculation about possible Japanese repatriation 	
 Later on Friday  focus turns to the closely watched U S 
non farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT  Forecasts centre on a
rise of 190 000 jobs in March  a Reuters poll showed 	
 The Australian dollar rose 0 2 percent to  1 0346  hovering
near a 29 year high of  1 0373 hit on Thursday

145402,366917,STT,ANALYSIS After brief hiatus  emerging markets are back,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  April 5  Reuters    The exodus of investors from
emerging market equities that began late last year is reversing 
in part due to the prospects for higher interest rates in 
developed economies and partly due to them becoming cheaper 
 Moves to date reflect a classic rotation by investors back
into a long term bull play that had become overbought  While
still tentative  they may be a precursor for a larger embrace of
high growth emerging markets later in the quarter 
 Emerging market equities were among the hottest investor
plays for much of 2009 and 2010  with MSCI s benchmark index for
the sector rising nearly 150 percent from March 2009 until
mid January this year 
 Until recently  however  many investors had switched out of
the sector  believing it to be overbought and at a disadvantage
to resurgent developed markets  particularly the United States 
The index was in the red for most of the first quarter 
 This has changed dramatically in the space of a week or so 
The index has gained around 10 percent since hitting a
post Japanese earthquake low on March 17  It is now up more than
3 6 percent for the year to date 
 Developed market stocks have underperformed  rising about 7
percent since March 17  although they remain the better bet for
the year to date  up more than 5 percent 
 It is not just market movements that suggest some kind of
return is underway 
 EPFR Global noted that emerging market equity funds it
tracked ended the first quarter with their highest weekly
inflow  a net  2 6 billion  since the first week of January 
This contrasted with a net 24 5 billion being pulled out in
the quarter for a whole 
 U S  financial services firm State Street  meanwhile  sees
increasing moves towards emerging market equities and currencies
in the multi trillion dollar portfolios it keeps as custodian 
  Flows into certain high beta currencies    namely the IDR
 Indonesia   KRW  Korea   MXN  Mexico  and ZAR  South Africa    
have firmed  while the past month has seen cross border equity
flows into EM once again outpace developed markets   it said

 CHANGING LANDSCAPE
 Expected rate rises from the European Central Bank starting
this week and the likelihood that the U S  Federal Reserve will
not extend ultra loose monetary policy have contributed to this
change 
 Part of this year s earlier rotation was based on
assumptions that monetary policy designed to boost economies in
developed economies would remain advantageous while higher rates
designed to cool growth in emerging markets were to be expected 
 That advantage has now dissipated 
  We saw food price inflation driving emerging monetary
policy  while nobody expected the ECB and Fed to move   said
Maarten Jan Bakkum  emerging equity strategist at ING Asset
Management 
  Now that has changed completely  Emerging market central
banks are probably close to done  
 China raised interest rates for the second time this year on
Tuesday but economists say it is well into its tightening cycle 
 Goldman Sachs  which predicted emerging markets sliding in
popularity in the first half of this year before picking up
again in the second  suggested that it may be time to switch
already  although it prefers developed stocks with emerging
exposure 
  After a few months of underperformance  we believe that
EM exposed stocks should start outperforming again  The
growth inflation outlook is improving in EM while developed
markets  especially in Europe  are likely to see an acceleration
in the pace of tightening   it said in a note 
 
 EARLY DAYS
 Monetary policy is not the only driver for emerging markets 
of course  Their hiatus from the investment landscape over the
first quarter or so has made them cheaper 
 I B E S data shows the 12 month forward price to earnings
ratio for emerging market stocks at 10 8  compared with 11 6
back in November 
 Developed market stocks  meanwhile  have stayed at around
12 1  which means a valuation gap has opened up 
 Some firms have been taking advantage of this as the flow
data shows 
 Many of the moves to date  however appear to be investors
shifting their recent underweight positions into more neutral
exposure 
 Credit Suisse has done just that and is eyeing the future
for emerging market gains to accelerate 
 The underlying appeal of fast growing emerging markets   
primarily a shift from West to East    remains a strategic play
even if there is the occasional short term tactical setback 
 Explaining his company s recent swing away from emerging
market stocks and then return  Lothar Mentel  chief investment
officer of Octopus Investments  said 
  We did not think that the overall massive growth story had
gone away  It was just a little bit over stretched

 PARIS  May 3  Reuters    European stocks sagged on Tuesday 
snapping their eight session winning run in a broad retreat led
by mining and oil shares  but analysts said the pull back was
technical and the market s upward trend remained intact 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0 5
percent lower at 1 150 81 points  ending a two week rally during
which it gained about 4 percent 
 The benchmark  however  managed to end above the session s
low as well as above a key support level  the 23 6 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally  at 1 149 49 points 
 Volume on the index was less than its 90 day average daily
volume  showing that Tuesday s pull back hasn t happened in
strong volumes which would have been a bearish signal 
 Miner Xstrata fell 2 4 percent while oil major Total shed
0 7 percent  as commodity prices retreated on renewed worries
over demand 
  We re talking about a short term pull back here which looks
like a bull trap as a lot of buyers who jumped in late are now
stuck  But on the longer term  the catalysts for growth in
corporate profits are still in place   said Franck Nicolas  head
of global asset allocation at Natixis Asset Management  which
has 302 billion euros   448 billion  in assets under management 
 Around Europe  the UK s FTSE 100 index gained 0 2 percent 
reopening after a long holiday weekend  while France s CAC 40
 lost 0 3 percent 
 Germany s DAX index  which had moved into overbought
territory two sessions ago  lost 0 4 percent 
 Shares of Deutsche Bank fell 2 1 percent after the U S 
government sued the German lender for more than  1 billion 
accusing it of defrauding the government by repeatedly lying to
obtain federal insurance guarantees on mortgage debt 
  The DAX is still in a positive momentum and its performance
since mid March is not surprising   said Frederic Dodard  head
of multi asset class solutions at State Street Global Advisors
France 
  German shares continue to be attractively valued in terms
of financial ratios  
 The DAX trades at 10 5 times expected earnings  below the
index s 10 year average of 13 4  according to Thomson Reuters
Datastream  By comparison  Europe s broad STOXX 600 index
 trades at 10 6 times expected earnings  and the S P 500 trades
at 12 9 times expected earnings 
 Despite the broad positive view on European stocks  the euro
currency s steady rally towards the key psychological level of
 1 50 is reigniting worries for the region s exporters and will
likely break the strong correlation between the euro and euro
zone equities seen in recent weeks 
 The 30 day rolling correlation between the single currency
and the euro zone s blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index  which has a
20 year average of  0 1  peaked at  0 61 last week and looks
poised for a reversal 
  North of  1 50  we re out of the comfort zone   a
Paris based equity trader said   Not that the whole market will
turn bearish  but people will become reluctant to buy exporters 
shares  at least until we see how bad the damage is on their
results

145406,366921,STT,Nothing  Puzzling  About Higher Haircuts In Bilateral Repo Markets,opinion,At times certain research from the Fed seems to be disconnected from reality  The NY Fed s recent analysis for example compares repo haircuts between bilateral and triparty repo  see   transactions for different collateral types during the 2008 financial crisis  They found that bilateral haircuts were materially higher and varied by collateral type  And while the results make sense  the researchers  interpretation does not  They entitled the article  The Odd Behavior of Repo Haircuts during the Financial Crisis     The different behavior of haircuts in the bilateral and tri party repo markets is puzzling  These two markets are similar  with both using the same contractual form and the same types of collateral  The purpose of some transactions in both markets is similar market participants have stated that financial entities use the two markets for funding purposes  These two markets are also tightly linked  the larger securities dealers operate in both markets and often provide intermediation services by rehypothecating into the tri party repo market collateral received via bilateral repos  These linkages suggest that haircut behavior across the two markets should be similar  Clearly they don t seem to be aware of what actually transpired in 2008  When a firm  a hedge fund  a mutual fund  an insurance firm  a broker dealer  etc   lent money to Lehman via repo on a bilateral basis  Lehman placed the collateral for this loan into the lender s securities account   at Lehman Once Lehman filed for bankruptcy  it would not pay back the money borrowed  The securities account where the collateral was sitting however was frozen by the court  By the time the lender was able to access her collateral and sell it  it had sometimes declined in value so much that the proceeds did not cover the loan balance  On the other hand if the collateral was held by a third party such as State Street or BoNY  as soon as Lehman couldn t pay  the lender was able to access and liquidate the collateral  Thus the differences in haircuts are not driven by the repo agreement itself   which is what these researchers seem to be focused on  It s driven by the fact that in a bilateral agreement it may take longer to access the collateral and liquidate it  potentially increasing losses  That risk of a longer liquidation period in the case of a default increased the bilateral haircut levels  As one would expect  the riskier the collateral the higher the risk differential because while an extra few days may not make a difference for treasuries or agency MBS  it could be tremendous for a subprime tranche  And in 2008 no financial institution seemed immune from filing for bankruptcy  potentially resulting in frozen securities accounts  Therefore these risk premiums in the bilateral repo markets were perfectly in line with the expectations  There should be nothing  puzzling  about this difference in haircuts  What is somewhat puzzling however is how central bank researchers who are disconnected from the realities of financial markets are given an opportunity to influence financial regulation and monetary policy ,2012-09-19,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nothing-'puzzling'-about-higher-haircuts-in-bilateral-repo-markets-136845,136845
145407,366922,STT,Good News  For Now,opinion,First  an observation  yesterday s article      received more hits than any other article I have written in recent memory  Apparently  people still are looking for bargains  and still looking for bond bargains as well  This is heartwarming to a bond guy  and of course even more to an inflation guy  But then  true bargains are rare  and true bargains offered by the government are even more rare  A belated hat tip to  Gratian   who asked me what I thought about I bonds and provoked that article  Thanks for the suggestion  There was some mild good news yesterday  Consumer Confidence rose more than expected  to 70 3 and only a couple of points below the post Lehman highs set in early 2010 and 2011  Yes  70 3 is still very low  the series is set so that confidence in 1985 equals 100  and in the recessions of the early 1980s and the early 1990s it was generally in the 55 80 range   but the longest journey begins with a single step  On the bright side  there s lots of room for improvement  see chart  source Bloomberg   The internals of the Confidence number are not as good  Both  current conditions  and the 6 month ahead outlook improved  especially the outlook  when  my guy   whoever your guy happens to be  will be in the White House six months from now  surely things will be better   but the  Jobs Hard to Get  subindex  which is highly correlated with the level of the Unemployment Rate  barely nudged lower  Still  as depressing as it sounds  consumer confidence is a relative bright spot among recent data  Home prices  as we have documented several times  are rising and the S P Case Shiller Home Price Index confirmed that by reaching the highest level it has seen since 2010  The 20 city composite is now rising at 1 2  year year  which doesn t sound much but is the highest rate of change since the dead cat bounce of 2010  Keep in mind that the index methodology involves a fair amount of smoothing  so it lags the actual improvement in the market  By comparison  the RadarLogic 28 day composite index as of the end of July recorded the highest year on year change since 2006  see chart  source Bloomberg    Also relatively good news was the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index  which rose to  4   not as good as it was earlier this year  but 23 points above its July low  The Richmond Fed district includes the  toss up  battleground states of North Carolina and Virginia and the  leans Romney  state of South Carolina  It is encouraging that manufacturing in this region  with its 28 toss up electoral votes  is outperforming activity in the Dallas Fed district  Texas  northern Louisiana  and southern New Mexico  none of which are considered toss ups   the Chicago Fed District  which includes Michigan  most of Illinois and Wisconsin  and 6 electoral vote toss up Iowa  and the Philly Fed district  which is Pennsylvania  NJ  and Delaware  and no toss ups   This is merely an observation  and even if there were clear indications that the Administration was directing money towards projects in battleground states I wouldn t object to it   that s one of the prerogatives of incumbency  If you want that prerogative  work hard so that you can get to be the incumbent  While the data points yesterday were good  stocks gave up the ghost and managed to lose most of the post FOMC rally  That doesn t really shock me so much  Commodities  which should be more sensitive to inflationary monetary policy  are down outright since the Fed declared an unbounded easing policy  and both markets have rallied since June on the growing expectation of QE3  The fact that QE3 was larger than many observers expected caused some short covering on the news  but I suspect most investors who thought QE3 was coming were already long their preferred assets  The actual open ended Fed buying will definitely buoy commodities  which remain undervalued relative to past QEs  and might lift equities  which  however  offer fairly weak prospective real returns given the current market valuations   but we had already priced in some expectations  And in the meantime  while yesterday s numbers were not bad  the overall picture remains pretty weak  I think the threat of sequestration at the end of the year will start to affect growth more seriously in October  because the end of the fiscal year for government expenditures is September 30th  Businesses that have the government as a significant client recognize that they may well be in Limbo on October 1st  This is what happens when government spending is 40  of GDP  The sequestration doesn t happen until January  so spending from October until December in theory will be unaffected  But  in practice  the government enters into contracts  for equipment and construction  for example  that cover many months  and it isn t entirely clear whether for example the Defense Department can enter into a one year contract if it isn t known that the money will be there  I know several people in businesses that are directly affected by this issue  and they re concerned about it now  not just in January  I saw an interesting study by State Street Global Advisors mentioned   According to the study  about   of institutional investor executives consider a  tail risk  event in the next twelve months to be likely  But here is the interesting paragraph in the P I article   Survey respondents   money managers  family offices  consultants and private banks   expect the five most likely causes of a tail risk event in the next year would be a global economic recession  36    a recession in Europe  35    the breakup of the eurozone  33    Greece dropping the euro  29    and a recession in the U S   21     Percentages total more than 100  because respondents could select multiple causes    Apparently   inflation  isn t even on the radar as a tail risk  Of course  as an investor  what is more important than the tail risks you can estimate the probabilities of are the tail risks you aren t even thinking about or can t estimate the probabilities of  Incredibly  not only has the myth that recessions cause disinflation and deflation failed to weaken during the last few years  when weak growth has been accompanied by accelerating core inflation  it seems to have strengthened  While investors  as evidenced by the performance of inflation linked bonds and of breakevens  and inflation swaps  and commodities  believe that inflation might well be a risk  it doesn t seem that many investors are focusing on it as a tail event  That is  they expect that a  bad  inflation outcome might be 2 5  or 3 0  core inflation  An outlier event to them may be 3 5  or 4 0   But what we know about inflationary outcomes is that if anything  they have tails that are quite long  And there s plausible reasoning which can produce very high numbers for that tail  see for example my article from late last month   before QE3   called     I always take care to say that these concerns aren t predictions  but they are plausible possibilities  and the bottom line is that we don t really know how these relationships work at this scale  No central bank has ever dealt with numbers like this  It is a known unknown  and thus a source of a tail risk of indeterminate length  In my opinion  when it s cheap to insure against such risks then it ought to be done  Presently  you can  as an institutional investor  protect against the risk that inflation will compound at greater than 4  for the next ten years for roughly 2 2  of the notional amount  or 22bps per annum  There are multiple ways to do this  some of which may be cheaper and all of which are beyond the scope of this article   but the point is that we have investors enumerating downward  tail risks  on growth while equity margins and valuations are high  and largely ignoring  tail risks  on inflation that could damage a number of different asset classes  I see lots of potentially dangerous scenarios for equities in October  several  but not all  of which are also dangerous for bonds ,2012-09-26,Michael

145408,366923,STT, ETFs Are Getting Cheap,opinion,One of the many benefits of using Exchange Traded Funds  ETFs  is cost  An investor today can build a complete portfolio using all ETFs for less than 25bps  0 25    The low cost leaders in ETFs have been Vanguard  State Street and Blackrock s iShares Recently Charles Schwab entered the ETF business offering Schwab branded ETFs with low pricing  On September 21  2012 the company announced that they are lowering prices even further What does this mean for investors  For Schwab investors  this is great news as they now have access to low cost ETFs that also trade at no commission on the Schwab trading platform  For investors holding accounts with other brokers like TD Ameritrade  E Trade or Fidelity  this drop in pricing does not necessarily matter as they would have to pay a trading commission to purchase the Schwab ETFs  negating the cost benefit unless the ETF is held for a long period of time I believe that Charles Schwab understands that assets invested in ETFs are on the rise versus assets invested with active mutual fund managers who  as a whole  have been underperforming their benchmarks for decades  By lowering the price of their commission free ETFs and launching an all ETF 401k plan  Schwab is embracing the future of investing  Through this process Schwab is looking to remain king of the hill in terms of assets under management  Perhaps their ETF offerings will also convince independent advisors to move their investors to the Schwab Institutional platform TD Ameritrade currently offers 100 transaction fee free ETFs chosen by Morningstar  The list includes ETF offerings from various providers such as Vanguard  State Street  iShares and Powershares  Fidelity also offers some iShares ETFs for no trading commission as well One thing is clear  the cost of investing is going down  which is a great benefit to long term investors  Investor education on understanding how to trade ETFs seems to be the next frontier in truly lowering ETF investors total cost ,2012-10-04,Casey Stubbs,https://www.investing.com/analysis/etfs-are-getting-cheap-138609,138609

145419,366934,STT,How Much Traction Has The Dollar Regained With EUR USD Below 1 3000 ,opinion,Despite the bearish flavor to Monday s headlines  there wasn t a strong bearish reaction from the capital and FX markets through the week s opening session  Without a definable risk aversion effort from the broader market  the dollar would find itself unable to capitalize  as a safe haven currency  on an otherwise promising set of circumstances  The first line of resistance holding the dollar back was the lack of progress by US equity benchmarks  the pinnacle of sentiment sensitive assets   The S P 500 slipped a modest 0 4 percent on the day   refusing to significantly fall back from the multi year  1475 high and refusing the first line bullish trend reversal below 1450  For the dollar itself  EUR USD dropped back below 1 3000  but the carry heavy AUD USD and competitive safe haven USD JPY both reflected greenback losses  The fact that the dollar did not gain further on a day that saw a significant downgrade in growth forecasts by the IMF  with severe cuts to eurozone and Japanese GDP projections and warning the risk of a global slowdown was  alarmingly high   suggests redirected interests  Perhaps earnings   Euro Takes a Battering Monday Before Crisis Upgraded  Growth Downgraded The fundamentals didn t do the euro any favors over the opening 24 hours of trading this week  On the docket  the eurozone investor confidence index  Sentix  for October posted a smaller recover than expected and remained deep in pessimistic territory  What should have been a positive announcement that the ESM was finally activated was marred by the Moody s response of offering a  Negative  outlook onto its  AAA  rating of the fund Later in the day  the headlines worsened  The EU Finance Ministers  meeting ended with the standard optimism expected from policy makers  but it also carried a sense of doubt for Greece   the most troubled of the region s members  And  making the situation even more troubled  the IMF s forecasts stated the EU crisis hasn t abated as expected  In turn  the region was expected to grow 0 2 percent in 2013  versus a previously projected 0 7 percent  and group suggested the ECB may have to cut rates further  Yet the bulk of this news happened after the euro s drop  We shouldn t take this as a  positive  response to negative data  rather a lack of surprise and redirected interests   British Pound the Worst Performer on the Day  Is There Follow Through  There was little mistaking the sterling s unique performance through Monday  The currency managed losses against all its major counterparts  hearty ones for the most part and even outpacing the Euro s own weakness  Where does this significant weight come from  The docket through Monday was relatively light  The FTSE 100 was holding out better than its euro area counterparts Even the 10 year Gilt s yield was joining the climb though the opening session  Perhaps this is a greater respect for the fundamental trouble the UK faces moving forward with the eurozone s financial issues spilling over rather than dissipating and global growth trends negating hope of a growth by exports scenario  Though this was released after the sizable GBP USD drop  the IMF s growth forecast downgrade was one of the biggest amongst the advanced economies  projecting a 0 4 percent contraction in 2013 versus a previous forecast for 0 2 percent growth   Australian Dollar Holds 1 0150 Against Dollar  Rallies Versus Euro on Risk Off Day If the wave of downgraded growth forecasts and renewed concerns with the Euro area s financial situation couldn t weigh US equities lower  there was little reason to suspect the high yield Australian dollar would make its own move lower  Indeed  the carry currency marked a notable rally against its funding alternatives that marked a very high profile turn at 1 0150 by AUD USD and AUD DJPY rebound from 79 50  What is far more interesting is the rebound in AUD CAD from an 18 month support  0 9950  and strong retracements from EUR AUD and GBP AUD  This suggests inherent Aussie dollar strength  The 78 percent probability of a 25bp rate cut at the next RBA meeting priced into the swaps market is not encouraging  but a 12 month forecast of 89bps of easing is materially better than 115bps last week  Has the market priced it all in   Japanese Yen Outperforms Majors  Pulls USD JPY Back from 79 Break Even though we didn t have much of a  risk aversion  drive through Monday  the best performer amongst the majors in the FX market was the safe haven Japanese yen  The crosses performance ranged from a 0 3 percent decline from CAD JPY up to a 1 1 percent plunge by GBP JPY  We know there was considerable fundamental drive behind the currency s counterparts  but the consistency from the yen cannot be dismissed  Risk aversion is typically the currency s calling card   as much for an unwinding of carry interest as it is for investors seeking out opening positions for stability  Through Monday  the most encouraging headline was from the World Bank which lowered its growth forecasts for East Asia and the Pacific to 7 2 percent  from 7 6 previously   This leverages appetite for a regional safe haven  That appeal was curbed somewhat  however  with the IMF s downgraded growth forecast for 2012  from 2 4 to 2 2 percent  and 2013  from 1 5 to 1 2 percent    Swiss Franc Tumbles after State Street Announces Charging for Franc Deposits Short term market and government bond rates in Switzerland have hovered near  and even below  zero for some time  A negative yield is a persuasive argument against hording capital in Swiss accounts  but that never really panned out as an immediate driver for the Swiss crosses through most of 2012  Yet  we could say that the  fair value  of EUR CHF was rising given the fundamental inequity   it was simply masked by the unnatural 1 2000 floor the SNB imposed  Now that we are above that level  we may better see the influence of these unusual financial aspects on capital flows  A good litmus test in the early morning hours Tuesday was an announcement by State Street that the financial firm would charge 0 25 percent on franc deposits  We have made the transition from small returns for holding Swiss assets to paying for it

   Dollar off Mon s lows but rise in stocks limits any gains

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON  July 21  Reuters    The dollar was steady against a
basket of currencies on Tuesday  kept off its recent lows by
investor caution ahead of Federal Reserve chairman Ben
Bernanke s congressional testimony 
 However the dollar continued to hover not far above Monday s
6 week trade weighted low as investors  appetite for risk was
still evident in equity markets  with European stocks up 0 7
percent 
 Bernanke will start his twice yearly testimony on the
economic outlook and monetary policy before the House Financial
Services Committee at 1400 GMT  
 Market players were nervous about this and another string of
U S  corporate earnings this week  with State Street and Coca
Cola due to report results on Tuesday 
 Meanwhile Bernanke highlighted in a Wall Street Journal
article that the central bank has a strategy for removing its
accommodative measures once a recovery takes hold  
  There is a lot of nervousness ahead of Bernanke s
testimony  and people will be looking for more concrete details
on the Fed s exit strategy on quantitative easing   CMC Markets
analyst James Hughes said 
 He said this helped the dollar to strengthen slightly in
early London trade  but its gains were limited in a market where
people are tending towards buying riskier assets  which
typically benefits the euro and currencies such as the
Australian dollar 
  CIT has been rescued  we ve had better earnings  better
economic data and risk appetite is up   this is the story
driving the market at the moment   he said 
 At 1012 GMT  the euro was steady at  1 4220  not far off a
six week high of  1 4250 hit on trading platform EBS the
previous day 
 The dollar index was also steady at 78 913  hovering close
to a six week low of 78 799 
 The yen was also steady  erasing earlier small gains  with
the euro at 134 00 yen 
 Higher risk currencies were slightly lower  however  with
the Australian dollar down 0 1 percent against the U S  dollar
at  0 8142 
 Sterling underperformed  trading down 0 8 percent at  1 6418
 after public finances data showed the worst June performance on
record  with net debt standing at 56 6 percent of gross domestic
product  the highest since records began in 1974  

 BERNANKE EYED
 Bernanke s testimony will be watched in particular for any
further comment on quantitative easing exit strategies or on the
outlook for the U S  economy 
 In the WSJ article  he said the Fed s exceptionally easy
policies would be warranted  for an extended period   but added
the huge amounts of money pumped into the economy will not
reduce its ability to push borrowing costs higher when it is
needed 
 Analysts and traders said the remarks helped remove some of
the uncertainty surrounding the testimony  but they do not
believe Bernanke is likely to say anything that will dampen
investor appetite for risk 
  Currently not much will burst the balloon of stock
recovery  and this points to more dollar weakness near term  
said Mic Mills  senior trader at ETX Capital  
 Elsewhere  the Canadian dollar dipped  with the U S  dollar
up 0 1 percent at C 1 1056  ahead of a Bank of Canada policy
decision at 1300 GMT  where it is expected to leave rates at a
historic low of 0 25 percent

   Dollar stems recent slide  risk demand seen returning
 
  Adds detail  comment  updates prices  changes byline 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON  July 21  Reuters    The dollar inched up on Tuesday 
pausing from a slide to a six week low against a currency basket
as traders booked profits on the U S  currency s losses ahead of
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke s congressional testimony 
 Currencies were little changed after an article by Bernanke
in the Wall Street Journal that said the U S  central bank has a
strategy for removing accommodative measures once a recovery
takes hold  But the central bank is not seen as in a hurry to
end quantitative easing 
 Mixed U S  and European earnings reports garnered limited
initial market reaction  U S  bank State Street s earnings per
share were lower than expected in the second quarter  while the
performance of Dupont and others exceeded expectations 
 Bernanke begins his twice yearly testimony on the Fed s
economic outlook and monetary policy before the U S  House
Financial Services Committee at 1400 GMT 
 Some analysts said more reassurances that the U S  economy
is improving    albeit slowly    may prompt a pick up in risk
demand and push the dollar lower 
  The focus is on whether Bernanke can maintain the balancing
act of conveying that the Fed is thinking about an exit strategy
but won t be initiating it it any time soon   said Jeremy
Stretch  strategist at Rabobank in London 
  If he can perform that act  the short term risks are for a
higher euro dollar  
 In the WSJ  Bernanke said the Fed s exceptionally easy
policies would be warranted  for an extended period   but added
the huge amounts of money pumped into the economy will not
reduce its ability to push borrowing costs higher when needed 
 At 1143 GMT  the euro was down slightly on the day at
 1 4220  but remained near a six week high of  1 4250 hit on
trading platform EBS the previous day  U S  stock futures inched
up 0 2 percent  after trading largely flat in European trade 
 The dollar index was also steady at 78 918  hovering close
to a six week low of 78 799 touched on Monday 
 
 RISK APPETITE
 Traders sold currencies seen to be higher risk  including
sterling and the Australian and New Zealand dollars  Sterling
was the day s biggest loser  falling as much as nearly 1 percent
to  1 6385 and retreating from a three week high as the pound
was stung by dismal UK public finances data 
 The dollar was little changed at 94 20 yen  but the Japanese
currency rose broadly on the crosses  pushing sterling down as
much as 1 percent  while the Australian and New Zealand
currencies also fell against the yen 
 The Canadian dollar inched up  with the U S  dollar down 0 2
percent at C 1 1038  before a Bank of Canada policy decision at
1300 GMT  where it is expected to leave rates at a historic low
0 25 percent  
 Traders were cautious about risk before Bernanke speaks  but
analysts said that overall  market remained tilted in favour of
risk appetite following mixed U S  earnings for the second
quarter and a last minute rescue deal for U S  lender CIT Group 
  CIT has been rescued  we ve had better earnings  better
economic data and risk appetite is up   this is the story

145434,366949,STT,INTERVIEW State St  inflation a top concern for sovereign funds,news,"By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG  Aug 24  Reuters    Inflation is becoming a top
concern to sovereign funds  which are looking at ways to guard
their portfolios against price pressures  State Street Global
Advisors  head of institutions business in Asia said 
 Persistent weakness in the U S  dollar and the extent to
which many benchmark bond yields have fallen because of
emergency policies are signals that inflation could become a
bigger concern for sovereign funds  which typically have a
longer time horizon  in about a year 
  Inflation is getting to be a concern  That s more of a
medium  to long term issue obviously  If you re a savvy
investor  you can see it coming   said Hon Cheung  regional
director  Asia official institutions group for the firm 
 State Street Global Advisors is the institutional asset
management business of State Street Corp 
 Cheung said in an interview on Monday that his firm was
advising sovereign funds it was not a good time to keep
relatively large bond overweights  and to hedge against price
pressures with stocks  commodities and inflation linked asset
classes 
 The role of sovereign wealth funds around the world  which
oversee about  3 trillion in assets  has been changed by the
financial crisis  At the initial stages of the crisis  they
were a key source of capital for struggling Western banks 
injecting about  80 billion into the industry

145435,366950,STT,Investor confidence rises in Aug to 5 year high State St,news,"LONDON  Aug 25  Reuters    Global investor confidence rose
for an eighth month in a row in August  hitting a five year high
thanks to a more bullish mood in Europe  U S  financial services
firm State Street said on Tuesday 
 The global State Street Investor Confidence Index hit 122 9
this month  up from 119 4 in July 
 The index has been above 100    the level considered to be
neutral    for five consecutive months  coinciding with a stock
market rally that began in March 
 It has also increased every month since December and is now
at a level not seen since May 2004 
  This month s increase     places the risk appetite of
institutional investors firmly in the range that is associated
with accumulation of risk exposures   said Harvard Professor Ken
Froot  a co developer of the index 
  At the same time  the rate of increase in the index has
moderated relative to some months ago  suggesting that
institutions are being somewhat selective in their allocations  
 Regionally  the confidence of North American institutional
investors declined slightly by to 118 4 from 120 6  Asian
investor confidence also slipped  to 91 8 from 94 1 
 By contrast  European institutional investors displayed
increased risk appetite with their index rising to 109 2 from
104 9 last month 
 The data is extrapolated from movements in around  16 4

administrator for institutional investors

145437,366952,STT,ANALYSIS Push for open SWFs risks investment shift,news,"By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  Sept 15  Reuters    Growing pressure on sovereign
wealth funds to open their books and enhance transparency may
force them to cut their investment horizons short and discourage
them from investing in illiquid but higher yielding assets 
 The secretive  3 trillion industry  which invests national
windfalls for future generations  has come under scrutiny as it
has replaced crisis hit private equity firms and hedge funds as
the main driver of corporate acquisitions 
 But with ever greater pressure at home to prove their
strategies are successful even in the short term  these funds
may opt more for relatively safe debt securities over riskier
equity stake building that may take years to yield fruit 
 Concerns have grown in many Western capitals that
state owned funds are investing with political rather than
commercial motives  These funds have responded by forming
working groups  agreeing their Santiago Principles of best
practices and releasing details of performance and strategies 
 Many welcome these efforts to open up  But the increased
transparency has also led to revelations of huge losses incurred
by investing in Western banks as the crisis unfolded    sparking
public criticism at home 
 As a result  SWFs have sharply reduced their headline
activities and come under pressure to invest in instruments or
projects that will give visible and accountable returns  rather
than in something which will hopefully yield something in a
loosely defined  somewhat  long   investment horizon 
  SWFs are under greater scrutiny than ever before  not least
from their domestic audiences   said John Nugee  head of
official institutions at State Street Global Advisors 
  The level and tone of some of the criticism by national
media for high profile losses on selected headline acquisitions
might even jeopardise their ability to take the long term
investment positions that have given them such a comparative
advantage  
 Total assets held by SWFs  many from resource rich emerging
economies  are estimated to have shrunk 15 20 percent after
their  80 billion investment into Western banks turned sour 
Currently making up almost a tenth of global stock market
capitalisation  SWF assets are expected to more than double in
the next 10 years 
 Their orthodox mandate is to maximise returns to provide
wealth for future generations    thereby allowing them to take a
 liquidity premium  and invest in illiquid instruments which
will bring higher extra returns in the long term 
 However  very few countries spell out the exact objectives
of their SWFs  resulting in some governments dipping into their
wealth funds to provide fiscal support during the crisis 
 Given the shrinking assets and reduced new inflows  SWFs
have sharply cut their activity in global corporate takeovers 
 According to data from Thomson Reuters  global announced M A
volumes involving state owned funds  which include pending and
completed deals  stood at  30 2 billion so far this year  This
compares with  53 0 billion in the same nine months in 2008 
 Deals are coming back to the market slowly however  with the
third quarter registering 29 pending and completed deals worth
 18 0 billion

 SANTIAGO BLUES 
 Leading sovereign funds formed the International Working
Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds in 2008  announcing a set of 24
principles and best practices  known as the Santiago Principles 
last October 
 The group    whose members include the United Arab Emirates 
Kuwait  Singapore  China  Korea  Russia and Norway    meets once
a year to exchange views on issues of common interest and the
next gathering is due in October in Baku  Azerbaijan 
 Gary Smith  head of central bank  supranational and SWF
business at BNP Paribas Investment Partners  warns that an
excessive push for transparency  coupled with recent poor
performance  could lower the risk appetite of SWFs and encourage
them to favour safer instruments such as bonds 
  Following the whole push towards transparency  funds opened
themselves up for a monitoring process which did not exist  
Smith said 
  We have transparency problems for them  The consequences
are that these guys are being marked to market on a daily basis
by domestic constituents  It s uncomfortable  particularly when
the assets under management shrink  
 
 NEED FOR STRUCTURE
 Sponsoring governments therefore need to spell out the
mandate of their SWFs with a clearer investment horizon   
thereby allowing them to ride out short term portfolio
fluctuations and protecting them from domestic criticism 
  Obviously we believe transparency is a good thing  The
problem of transparency is    daily performance  daily this 
daily that    that we create an obsession which often detracts
from what you are trying to achieve from a particular
portfolio   said John Green  global head of business development
at Investec 
  There should be governance structures  transparency 
disclosure but you don t want to drive the investment strategies
through public opinion   said Green  whose clients include
African official institutions

145438,366953,STT,Investor morale slips from 5 year high   State St,news,"LONDON  Sept 29  Reuters    Global investor confidence fell
in September for the first time this year after hitting a
five year high in the previous month as investors consolidated
their holding of risky assets  State Street said on Tuesday 
 The global State Street Investor Confidence Index fell to
118 1 from a revised August level of 122 8 
 The index has been above 100    the level considered to be
neutral    for six consecutive months  coinciding with a stock
market rally that began in March 
 The index increased every month between December and August 
when it hit the level not seen since May 2004 
  Institutional investors took a breather this month and
consolidated their holdings of risky assets  This month s
reading    is still comfortable in the range associated with the
accumulation of risk exposures   said Ken Froot  Harvard
University professor and co developer of the index 
  However  there is a recognition that a portion of the
recent rise in global equity prices can be attributed to
liquidity expansion rather than fundamental opportunities 
Institutional investors are pausing to assess this balance  
 Regionally  the confidence of North American institutional
investors declined slightly to 113 7 from 118 3  European
investor confidence rose to 110 9 from 109 3 while Asian morale

145439,366954,STT,Italy s Intesa  BMPS in talks on branches sources,news,"By Stefano Bernabei
 ROME  Oct 1  Reuters    Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo SpA is
in talks to buy about 50 branches from Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA and is offering between 125 million euros   182 1
million  and 150 million  sources close to the issue said on
Thursday 
 Differences over price  however  have prevented Intesa
Sanpaolo  Italy s biggest retail bank  and Monte dei Paschi from
reaching a deal  said the sources  who spoke on condition of
anonymity 
 Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper reported on Thursday Intesa
Sanpaolo Chief Executive Corrado Passera had presented a paper
on the branches to a board meeting on Tuesday  Spokesmen for the
banks declined to comment 
  The talks are still under way but it has not led to a
formal offer because up to now there has been a strong
difference on price   one of the sources said 
 Gaining control of coastal branches in the central Italian
region of Tuscany would let Intesa fill out the network of its
Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze unit  the source said  Monte dei
Paschi  in turn  would avoid overlap with Banca Toscana  its
main subsidiary 
 Intesa Sanpaolo  which has about 5 400 retail branches in
Italy  expressed interest in the branches in June  It has
offered 2 5 million euros to 3 million for each one  a second
source said 
 However  Monte dei Paschi wants 5 million euros  the price
at which it sold 15 branches to Banca Popolare di Puglia e
Basilicata in June  with a capital gain of 46 million euros  the
source said 
 Monte dei Paschi  the world s oldest bank  must sell up to
135 branches by mid December for antitrust reasons 
 The sale would help Monte dei Paschi boost its capital
ratios  It has signed up to issue about 2 billion euros in bonds
under a government programme aimed at shoring up bank capital
and assuring lending 
 At its Tuesday meeting  Intesa Sanpaolo s board decided to
shun the state aid and issue a 1 5 billion euro Tier 1 bond  It
also will carry out asset disposals worth 11 billion euros to 15
billion  it said 
 The bank said on Sept  11 assets up for sale  listing or
partnership included asset manager Banca Fideuram  Exor SpA has
said it is interested in Fideuram 
 News reports also have said Intesa is in talks to sell its
depositary banking service to State Street Corp

145442,366957,STT,Does This Rally Have Legs ,opinion,"After enduring a Q3 characterized by a  risk off  trade   global equity markets bounced back in October on reassurances that the systemic risk posed by the European sovereign debt issue was being  dealt with  and continued signs of an ongoing economic recovery 95  of the markets we follow report positive results in October    the  most positive  month in over a year Everyone loves a rally  but the question is Does this rally have legs The sovereign debt problem will not be solved overnight  but the political will to ensure that it won t cause a banking crisis is something they can muster in a hurry     But until all of the i s are dotted and the t s are crossed  we can t assume this problem has been put to bed But if uncertainty about risks to the global financial system continue to wane  we have some hope for the rally to continue   There is more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling going on here     

Of the 284 companies in the S P 500 that have reported earnings for Q3 2011 to date  77  have reported earnings above the analysts estimate  
The earnings growth rate for Q3 2011 is 15 1   
The current 12 Month forward P E ratio is 12 1  23  below its 10 year  average   A return to  normal  levels would trigger a 23  rise in  equities 
The American Association of Individual Investors reported a bullish  sentiment of 43    the highest since April  and the bearish sentiment  indicator hit 25    the lowest of the year    US retail investors are  moving back to a risk on trade 
Globally  State Street s Investor Confidence Indicator for Global  Equities jumped back up to its 12 month moving average after plunging in  Q3 
So if investor confidence has returned  and corporate profitability is on the upswing  can we assume that the rally has legs  



One of the biggest criticisms we noticed about October  hard to believe people found something to complain about  but they did  was the  volume argument    The volume argument states that if stocks rise on less volume than they fell on  the rally doesn t really reflect the true  worth  of the companies   It has some intuitive appeal  as the assumption is that lots of trades represent a better level of price discovery than a handful of trades   So  what were the numbers   Volume on the Dow was just over 5 billion shares in October   about the same as September and more than any other month except August  7 billion    5 billion trades of the most liquid 30 stocks in the world seems like adequate price discovery to us This rally has legs  but it won t be a smooth ride    Once we get a final plan from the Eurozone and  some promising news out of the Supercommittee in DC  the next leg of this rally will begin   on steroids In the meantime  we ve fastened our seatbelts ",2011-11-06,"Keith Summers, CFA",https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-this-rally-have-legs-104675,104675

145445,366960,STT,These Are Exactly The Kinds Of Stocks You Want To Own Right Now   ,opinion,Roughly one month ago  online travel provider Priceline com  Nasdaq    made a nice gesture toward shareholders  announcing plans to buy back  200 million worth of company stock  Investors should hope that the company doesn t follow through on this plan  because shares have shot up roughly  120 since the March 7 announcement to a lofty  763 This means Priceline will buy back fewer shares than the month ago announcement would imply  Priceline would be better off canceling that buyback plan  perhaps waiting for a major pullback before putting a buyback plan into motion Sadly  Priceline com has plenty of company    I went back and looked at every stock buyback announcement since October 2011  and in most instances  the current share price is solidly higher than when the buyback plan was first announced  As I ve noted in the past  buying back stock while it trades at multi year highs has proven to be a big waste of shareholder money    Instead  it s wiser to look at stocks that have fallen since the buyback was announced  The lower share price is clearly good news  because the share count can be reduced that much more quickly with a fixed amount of funds    To be sure  buybacks create a solid backstop for nervous investors  State Street  NYSE     Keycorp   NYSE     Comerica  NYSE    Dycom  NYSE    and Safeway  NYSE    have all announced buybacks in the past 30 days  and if the market swoons in coming weeks  then these buyback plans should provide buying support as the companies buy back stock that investors are selling  Thanks to the recent market pullback  all of these stocks are only modestly lower than when the share buyback was announced  If you go further back  then you can find several stocks trading well below levels when a buyback was initially announced  Here are some interesting ones to consider    1  Potash Corp  of Saskatchewan  NYSE    This fertilizer producer had to regroup in late 2010 after the Canadian government blocked a takeover by mining giant BHP Billiton  NYSE     Potash was fine with that decision anyway  noting that BHP s offer of  130 a share  or  43 a share  was  grossly inadequate     Shares of Potash moved past  60 in early 2011 as investors came to agree that the stock was quite undervalued  In support of the stock  Potash began buying back  2 billion worth of stock  That buyback is now going a lot further now that Potash s shares are below  45    Part of the share price weakness steams from a fairly weak fourth quarter  A drop in fertilizer demand led the company to trail profit forecasts by roughly 10   Analysts quickly slashed their profit forecasts for the first and second quarters of 2012 as well  but the current  0 65 earnings per share  EPS  consensus now looks too low    That s because farmers have set very aggressive planting targets this spring and appear to be restocking their fertilizer supplies a fast clip  Goldman Sachs expects     a strong U S  spring application season will be a positive driver for shares as robust farmer demand coupled with production cuts help draw down the current inventory overhang     With shares trading near BHP s lowball offer  Potash appears to offer solid downside support  That massive stock buyback could bolster per share profits by shrinking the share count    2  Cypress Semiconductor  NYSE    Roughly a year ago  I noted that Cypress Semiconductor was seeing decent business momentum  as its shares were under girded by a stock buyback    But about a month ago  Cypress warned business had slowed a bit  slashing first quarter sales guidance from about  205 million to roughly  185 million  That pushed shares down to a recent  14 30  well below the upper teens level where the company s share buyback was announced in early 2011  Yet even as Cypress warned of a first quarter shortfall  management noted that business appeared to be bottoming out and predicted that subsequent quarters would look more robust    In the fourth quarter of 2011  Cypress bought back roughly 10 million shares  The company still has  319 million left on the current share buyback plan  which would sop up more than 20 million additional shares  The recent swoon likely means Cypress has been an active buyer of its own stock in recent weeks  Nearly 10  of shares outstanding have been bought back during the past 15 months  and by the time the current plan is done  that figure could approach 30   which will have a commensurately positive effect when business bounces back  Analysts at Dougherty   Co  say the worst is over and expect a   second half  ramp and continued momentum into 2013 off new products   They have a  20 price target in place  though investors may wish against that in the near term so Cypress can buy back more shares while they trade near lows    Risks to Consider  Stock buyback plans don t stop shares from falling  but they likely slow the decline a bit     Action to Take     These are the kinds of stocks you want to own if the market gets hit by a wave of profit taking this earnings season  Companies that have recently announced buyback plans may move back into favor if and when this happens  Many of these companies will provide progress reports on their current share buyback efforts  so it pays to see how

145455,366970,STT,Time For The SEC To Institute New Disclosure Rules On CEO Leverage,opinion,Here is a challenge for the SEC  Instead of   how about instituting some new disclosure rules for public companies  When a CEO has  co investments  in the assets of the firm and uses material amounts of leverage to make these investments  the shareholders should know about it  In addition to the obvious risks of conflicts  if for some reason the CEO can t meet his her obligations  it would have a negative impact on the shareholders  This is particularly true if the assets end up being liquidated or the CEO has pledged large amounts of company stock against the loans      Aubrey McClendon  the CEO of Chesapeake Energy Corp  has borrowed as much as  1 1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of company wells   a move that analysts  academics and attorneys who reviewed loan documents say raises the potential for conflicts of interest   The loans  which haven t been previously detailed to shareholders  are used to fund McClendon s operating costs for an unusual corporate perk that offers him a chance to invest in a 2 5 percent interest in every well the company drills  McClendon in turn is using the 2 5 percent stakes as collateral on those same loans  documents filed in five states show   The size and nature of the loans raise questions about whether McClendon s personal financial deals could compromise his fiduciary duty to Chesapeake investors  experts who reviewed the documents told Reuters   Both McClendon and Chesapeake said the loans don t pose any conflict of interest  And they are private transactions that the company has no responsibility to disclose or to vet  Chesapeake said   There are no covenants or obligations in my loan documents or mortgages that bind Chesapeake in any way   McClendon wrote in an email to Reuters    Sure there are no covenants and there doesn t seem to be anything illegal about the loans  But this is highly relevant for the shareholders   probably more relevant than many other disclosures CHK makes  Again  the SEC needs to focus on broad investor protections and disclosures  rather than concentrating so much on hedge funds  whose investors represent a tiny fraction of the population  Some of the largest mutual funds such as Vanguard and State Street are the biggest shareholders of CHK  That means that most people s 401Ks probably have exposure ,2012-04-19,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/time-for-the-sec-to-institute-new-disclosure-rules-on-ceo-leverage-120645,120645

145464,366979,STT,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 Dutch KAS Bank close to German takeover CEO,news,"  KAS Bank investments have risen in line with market
   Trading volumes in past few months slightly up
   Banks could be hit by corporate credit writedowns
   Shares close up 0 6 percent 
 By Gilbert Kreijger
 AMSTERDAM  June 9  Reuters    Dutch KAS Bank  a wholesale
provider of securities services such as custody  is close to
buying operations in Germany and has seen its own investments
rise in line with the market  its chief executive said 
  In addition to organic growth we are looking at small
acquisitions and if necessary also a larger acquisition  This
has happened less in the past one and half years of course but
we are now looking in Germany at something   KAS Bank Chief
Executive Albert Roell told Reuters 
 KAS Bank  which competes in Europe with U S  State Street
and European privately held Euroclear  was close to a German
deal to take over a specialist unit in fund and asset
administration  Roell said 
 Roell said he expected European banks to reconsider their
operations and to spin off some specialist activities 
  We have already seen this a little in the last few years
but this will increase  Banks will say   We don t want to keep
doing this kind of services  it s better to go to specialists   
Roell said 
 KAS Bank shares closed up 0 6 percent at 12 08 euros  after
trading lower most of Tuesday 
 Trading volumes at KAS Bank  which made a 39 9 million euro
  55 4 million  loss in 2008 due to writedowns and had 89 2
million euros of commission income  had slightly risen since
markets normalised and recovered partly in March  Roell said 
  Investments for own account     of which KAS Bank has
relatively few    were all recovering slightly   Roell said 
 The value of the five bank perpetual bonds that KAS Bank
owns had probably risen in line with broader market movement in
the past three months  Roell said 
  I have full confidence in all five banks  These are all
five systemic banks  I have full confidence in them  including
ING   Roell said 
 Roell did not rule out that credit assets could fall
further 
  We are in the middle of a recession  The biggest hits are
still to come   Roell said 
  Markets have had a great rally but no one is saying that
this is the end of the crisis  If you are practically looking at
a recession then there will be a lot more problems in normal
industry  which in turn will spill over to the banks

145465,366980,STT,US fund managers eye Lloyds  Insight arm  sources,news,"  US fund firms consider bids for Insight
   Bids for the unit due imminently
   First round bidders pre selected
 
 By Victoria Howley and Simon Meads
 LONDON  June 19   Reuters    U S  investment managers are
circling Lloyds Banking Group s third party asset management
arm  after rival BlackRock scooped up Barclays Global Investor 
people familiar with the situation said on Friday 
 Bids for Insight Investment s third party business are due
imminently from a small group of pre selected bidders  two
people familiar with the process told Reuters on Friday 
  The pre selected parties are mainly trade bidders  The
process will be opened up more widely if the offers are too
low   one of the people said 
 Lloyds and Insight Investment declined to comment 
 Offers for Insight are likely to be in the range of 150
million to 300 million pounds   245 million to  491 million  
the sources said 
 As at March 31  Insight had total assets under management of
116 6 billion pounds   190 7 billion   including 70 billion
pounds managed on behalf of third parties 
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp  which was bidding against
BlackRock for BGI  was likely to make an offer  the sources
said  State Street Corp and privately held Fidelity Investments
were also potential suitors 
 Bank of New York Mellon and Fidelity declined to comment 
State Street could not be reached for comment 
 Advent International together with Hellman and Friedman 
owner of UK asset manager Gartmore and a bidder for Barclays
iShares  are also expected to submit bids  the people said  but
it is unclear whether they are in the group of first bidders 
 Both firms declined to comment 
 Part nationalised UK lender Lloyds said earlier this year
that it would keep Insight separate from its other funds arm 
Scottish Widows Investment Partnership 
 The move was interpreted by analysts as paving the way for a
sale of one or both businesses 
 Abdallah Nauphal  recently appointed to head SWIP in
addition to his role as managing director and chief investment
officer at Insight  has been mulling a management buyout of
Insight s third party business  according to reports 
  There is no question there are both private equity and
strategic  buyers  in the process so it is by no means a slam
dunk MBO at all  I think strategics have a good chance here  
said another person close to the process 
 More private equity firms are likely to enter the process if
first round bids do not meet the vendor s expectations  the
sources said

 The global State Street Investor Confidence Index hit 115 5
this month from an upwardly revised 108 5 last month 
 The index has been above 100    the level considered to be
neutral    for three consecutive months  coinciding with most of

 It has also increased every month since December 
  Notwithstanding some concerns around the long run
sustainability of fiscal positions and the impact of
quantitative easing on inflation  institutional investors
continue to endorse the long run outlook   said Ken Froot 
co developer of the index 
 Confidence was up most strongly in Europe  where the index
rose to 95 0  Morale also improved robustly among North American
investors  climbing 6 2 points to 113 6

145467,366982,STT,FOREX Dollar limps on risk rally  hits 6 wk low vs euro,news,"  Dollar falls broadly  euro dollar hits 6 week high
   Share prices up 1 4 pct  boosting risk demand
   CIT Group strikes last minute rescue deal
 
  Adds comment  details  updates prices 
 By Nick Vinocur
 LONDON  July 20  Reuters    The dollar fell broadly on
Monday  hitting a six week low against the euro  as traders
flocked to riskier assets as a rescue for U S  lender CIT and
hope for more solid corporate earnings boosted share prices 
 A further pick up in risk appetite pushed the euro to around
 1 4248 according to Reuters data  its strongest since early
June  and lifted European stocks by 1 4 percent  This helped to
push the dollar to a six week trough versus a currency basket 
 The last minute financing deal for CIT Group late on Sunday
was also helping risk sentiment as it eased concerns the lender
would have to seek bankruptcy protection   ID nLK693118 
 Assets considered to be higher risk extended gains after
rallying last week when investors took mixed U S  corporate
earnings as an optimistic sign that the economy is improving 
  A big relief was this CIT news    that s what s been
driving the  equity  market higher and  as a result  driving
euro and sterling higher   said Audrey Childe Freeman 
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in London 
 Volumes were light with Tokyo shut for a local holiday 
 At 1114 GMT  the euro  traded a full percent higher at
 1 4214  A euro dollar climb above  1 4339 touched in June would
take the pair to its highest level of the year 
 The dollar index  was down 0 6 percent at 78 867 
after falling as low as 78 799  its lowest since early June 
 The U S  currency struggled broadly  pushing sterling and
the Australian and New Zealand currencies each up as much as 1 5
percent  The New Zealand dollar rose near its 1 year high 
 Despite broad weakness  the dollar rose 0 3 percent to 94 47
yen as risk demand also stung the Japanese currency  This helped
to push the UK and antipodean currencies up around 1 5 percent
against the yen 
 
 MORE EURO GAINS 
 The euro s climb on Monday lifted it above the 50 percent
Fibonacci retracement level of the pair s peak to trough move in
2008  which was located around  1 4190 
 Some technical analysts said this opened the way for further
gains in the pair  while others were less optimistic  pointing
out that previous efforts to do so have proved unsuccessful 
  The market is going to be bid over the next day or two but
I don t see dollar weakness lasting past the end of the week  
said Tom Pelc  head of technical strategy at RBS in London 
  I don t think the market can get above  1 46 on any kind of
continued upward move   he added  referring to the next key
Fibonacci level  the 61 8 percent retracement 
 Growing expectations of an improvement in the U S  economy
have sent investors searching for higher yields 
 Last week  Goldman Sachs Group and JPMorgan Chase reported
better than expected results for the second quarter  while Bank
of America posted a lower quarterly profit 
 U S  financials reporting this week include American
Express  State Street and Bank of New York Mellon  Some analysts
said disappointing earnings from those firms may trigger risk
aversion and prompt selling in high risk assets 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will start his
semi annual testimony to the U S  government on Tuesday 
 Many in the market said the focus would be on any reference
to a possible exit strategy from quantitative easing  while some
analysts pointed out that a less than optimistic view of the
economy may cut risk demand 
  If sterling and the euro are looking increasingly
overbought  more cautious remarks from the Fed may give people
the opportunity to take profits  from recent gains   and we
could see a correction   said BBH s Childe Freeman

145475,366990,STT,WRAPUP 1 Sentiment surveys show investors hoping worst over,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  April 21  Reuters    Investors are becoming
increasingly confident that equity markets and the world economy
are on the mend following a near 30 percent stock rally and a
series of better than expected economic reports 
 Even as global stocks were taking a hit on Tuesday amid
renewed worries about the state of U S  banks  two sentiment
surveys showed investors looking ahead to better times 
 State Street s monthly global investor confidence index shot
up to a nine month high in April  with the U S  financial
services firm finding improved sentiment across the board in
North America  Europe and Asia 
 Meanwhile  Germany s ZEW survey of analysts and investors
not only rose more than expected it entered positive territory
for the first time since before the credit crisis erupted 
  Investors are gradually seeing light at the end of the
tunnel   said economist Andreas Rees from Unicredit 
 The two sentiment indicators fit into a pattern seen in
other surveys  Reuters asset allocation polls  for example  have
shown a steady increase in the appetite for equities since the
beginning of the year 
 The latest surveys follow a sharp rise on world equity
markets  MSCI s all country world index began rallying from a
low on March 9 and rose nearly 30 percent over six weeks of
gains 
 There has also been as stream of economic news that at the
very least has suggested a levelling off of the global downturn 
 The past two days  however  have seen losses and raised the
question among some investors as to whether the rally is simply
stalling or will reverse 
 SENTIMENT UP
 State Street said its global investor confidence index rose
by 9 4 points to 79 6  its highest since July  from the upwardly
revised March reading of 70 2 
 The index is now 65 percent up on an all time low in
December of 48 2  but well off the record high of 111 set in
February 2001 
  Institutional investors have participated with some
enthusiasm in the recent market recovery   said Ken Froot 
Harvard University professor and a co developer of the index 
 The data is extrapolated from movements in around  12
trillion of assets State Street holds as custodian for
institutional investors 
 The Mannheim based ZEW economic think tank said its monthly
poll of economic sentiment rose to 13 0 from  3 5 in March 
showing its first positive reading since July 2007 
 April s rise took the headline index to its highest level
since June 2007  shooting well past the 1 5 consensus forecast 
 The ZEW report comes days before two other German indicators
are expected to show slight improvements    both a purchasing
managers  survey due on Thursday and Friday s business climate
index from the Ifo institute are seen edging up in April

 NEW YORK  May 13  Reuters    U S  consumers took the wind
from the sails of optimists looking for a swift end to the
recession on Wednesday as April retail sales fell  signaling
they are not yet ready to lead the world back to growth 
 Following a report of diving European industrial output and
a Bank of England forecast saying Britain needed a long period
of healing  hopes slipped for a quick rebound for the global
economy 
  This would deal a considerable blow to the  green shoots 
talk and it s possible that would hit some of the recent
optimism in the markets and hurt risk appetite   said Robert
Blake  senior currency strategist at State Street Global
Markets in Boston 
 World stocks  which have been gaining as investors sensed

 Sales at U S  retailers fell for a second straight month in

extremely unwise for anyone to claim that they know what the
future is to hold  
 Reuters polls of more than 200 economists across Europe

 By Lucia Mutikani
 WASHINGTON  May 13  Reuters    Sales at U S  retailers fell
for a second straight month in April as cash strapped consumers
held back on some purchases  according to a government report
on Wednesday that dented hopes the economy was beginning to
improve 
 The Commerce Department said total retail sales slipped 0 4
percent after falling by 1 3 percent in March  Excluding motor
vehicles and parts  sales dipped 0 5 percent in April  compared
to a 1 2 percent decline the prior month 
 Economists had expected retail sales to be flat in April 
 While the pace of decline in retail sales slowed from the
prior month  the report dampened expectations of a quick end to
the nation s deep recession 
  I would say the likelihood is growing that second quarter
consumption in the U S  is going to be negative   said Robert
Blake  senior currency strategist at State Street Global
Markets in Boston 
  This would deal a considerable blow to the green shoots
talk and it s possible that would hit some of the recent
optimism in the markets and hurt risk appetite  
 U S  shares fell on the data  while government bond prices
rose 
  These numbers are certainly discouraging  a bit
disheartening   said David Resler  chief economist at Nomura
Securities in New York 
 Vehicles and parts sales rose 0 2 percent after a 2 0
percent plunge in March  the Commerce Department said 
 Gasoline sales dropped 2 3 percent in April after tumbling
3 2 percent the previous month  Sales of electronic goods fell
2 8 percent  versus a 7 8 percent plunge in March  while
building materials rose 0 3 percent after slipping 0 8
percent 
 In another report  the Commerce Department said business
inventories fell 1 0 percent in March  after declining by 1 4
percent in February  This was as the stock of unsold motor
vehicle and parts fell 2 0 percent 
 In a separate report  the Labor Department said import
prices rose 1 6 percent  a second straight monthly increase
after a 0 2 percent gain in March 
 Nonetheless  import prices on a year over year basis
plunged a record 16 3 percent   a sign that inflation is
unlikely to be a short term problem in view of relatively weak
global demand 
 Imported petroleum prices were up 15 4 percent in April  
the largest monthly rise since a 17 percent increase in March
2002   following revised rises of 7 9 percent in March and 5 3
percent in February 
 But nonpetroleum import prices fell 0 4 percent in April  
a ninth straight monthly decline    and were down a record 5 6
percent on a year over year basis 
 Export prices rose 0 5 percent in April after a revised 0 7
percent decrease in March but were down 6 8 percent from April
a year earlier 
 Separately  mortgage applications slipped to the lowest
level since mid March  driven by a drop in requests to
refinance loans even as borrowing costs dipped toward record
lows last week  according to the Mortgage Bankers Association

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON  May 14  Reuters    The dollar inched up on Thursday 
supported after sluggish U S  retail sales figures reminded
investors that recent optimism about a global economic recovery
may be premature and kept risk aversion high 
 Ongoing uncertainty about the recovery in the global economy
was highlighted by movements in European shares  which bobbed
between positive and territory and helped to keep currencies
hemmed in narrow ranges 
  There s volatility in viewpoints  about the economy  at the
moment  which is creating instability   said Marc Ostwald 
strategist at Monument Securities 
  The currency market  and particularly euro dollar  is
keeping an inordinately close eye on equities   he said  adding
that even the slightest bump lower in share prices was putting
some selling pressure on the pair 
 By 0951 GMT  the euro had slipped 0 1 percent to  1 3585 
pulling back from a session high around  1 3623 hit after
European shares briefly recovered earlier losses and turned
positive 
 The pair stayed near  1 3525 touched on trading platform EBS
earlier in the day  its weakest since late last week  while
keeping its distance from a seven week high of  1 3722 hit on
Wednesday 
 Concerns that a global economic recovery will take much more
time kept investors cautious about taking on risky positions 
stinging share prices and prompting some to reverse aggressive
short dollar positions accumulated earlier in the week 
 The dollar is often considered a safe haven bet in times of
uncertainty 
 The U S  currency rose slightly against a basket of
currencies to 82 661  extending its recovery after the dollar
index hit a four month low of 81 998 earlier in the week 
according to Reuters data 
 European shares fell 0 3 percent  which also helped to
prompt investors to exit positions in higher risk currencies 
helping to prod the high yielding Australian dollar roughly 0 4
percent lower versus the dollar and the yen 
 Sluggish stock prices offered broad support to the yen 
nudging the dollar down as low as 95 14 yen in Asian trade to
match its weakest level in nearly two months  The pair later
pulled back to around 95 35 yen 
 The euro slipped 0 3 percent to 129 41 yen  while
sterling yen fell 0 2 percent 
 With few major economic data releases in the euro zone 
traders remained focussed on data on Wednesday which showed
cash strapped U S  consumers continue to hold back from
purchases due to job losses  falling home prices and tighter
credit 
 Dealers were waiting for figures on U S  weekly jobless
claims and producer prices due later in the day for more clues
into how long the country s economic recovery will take 
 
 ECB COMMENTS
 The euro offered little sustained reaction to comments by a
handful of European Central Bank Governing Council members who
separately offered diverse views on the outlook for interest
rates and  non standard  policy measures to help the euro zone
weather the downturn 
 ECB Vice President Lucas Papademos on Thursday said he had
observed more positive signs suggesting economic stabilisation
and that a recovery may start sooner than previously envisaged 
 His comments contrasted with Governing Council Member Nout
Wellink  who cautioned against becoming too optimistic about the
economic growth  
 Ewald Nowotny said the ECB s key rate may eventually
approach  the lower boundary of zero   while adding that in such
a situation  the central bank had other measures to turn to  The
ECB cut its main rate by 25 basis points to 1 0 percent last
week 
 His colleague  Axel Weber  on Wednesday reiterated that very
short term interest rates are now at an appropriate level 
 Earlier in the week  he said there was no need for the ECB
to expand its asset purchase programme after it announced it
would start buying covered bonds 
 Analysts said comments from the ECB underlined brewing
disagreement between policymakers regarding how much lower rates
can fall  and the extent to which quantitative easing measures
may be expanded to help the euro zone economy weather the
downturn 
  If the disagreement between the doves and the hawks in the
ECB become more vocal  that will result in a downside for the
euro   said Lee Ferridge  vice president and senior macro
strategist at State Street in London

 LONDON  May 14  Reuters    World stocks fell for a fourth 
straight day on Thursday while the low yielding dollar and yen
advanced as the previous day s weak U S  retail data prompted
investors to cut back on risky assets after their 9 week rally 
 Oil prices also fell  weighing on energy shares  while
government bonds rose as investors took a break from a risk
buying frenzy after data showed on Wednesday sales at U S 
retailers fell for a second straight month in April 
 The report broke a string of more upbeat reports that had
suggested the economic slump was abating 
  Yesterday s retail sales were a blow to the green shoots
theory because that theory had been predicated on the resilient
U S  consumer   said Lee Ferridge  vice president and senior
macro strategist at State Street 
 However  market indicators showed a recovery is still on
track  The cost of borrowing dollars  euros and sterling for
three months hit record lows in London  suggesting banks are
more willing to lend  while shipping costs hit a 2009 high on
Wednesday on the back of strong Chinese demand for commodities 
MSCI world equity index fell 0 9 percent  extending a
decline after hitting a six month high on Monday  The index is
on track for the first weekly loss in 10 weeks 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0 5 percent  Oil and gas
shares were main loser of the day 
 U S  crude oil fell 2 percent to  56 90 a barrel 
 Emerging stocks fell 2 2 percent  U S  stock futures were
down around 0 5 percent  pointing to a lower open on Wall
Street 
  Equity markets now look  toppy  after their fantastic run 
A measure of profit taking is now sensible as the prices become
divorced from economic reality of conditions in the developed
countries   Peter O Connor  deputy chairman at FundQuest  an
asset management arm of BNP Paribas  said in a note 
  Misjudging this wave will be painful  The cash raised can
be deployed successfully at lower levels later in the year  
 
 PULLBACK
 The pullback in stocks comes after a near 40 percent rally
since mid March which generated optimism even among central bank
governors  including European Central Bank President Jean Claude
Trichet  who said earlier this week the global economy might
have turned around the corner 
 In a further sign of easing tensions  the interbank cost of
borrowing three month dollar  euro and sterling funds plumbed
fresh all time lows  Three month dollar rates fell to 0 85438
percent 
 On Wednesday  the Baltic Exchange s main sea freight index 
which tracks rates to ship dry commodities  hit a new 2009 high 
driven by continued demand for goods by China 
 The index  which gauges the cost of shipping resources
including iron ore  cement  grain  coal and fertiliser  rose to
2 332 points on Wednesday from 2 253 on Tuesday  
 The June bund futures rose 50 ticks  helped by comments from
ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny who said key interest
rates may approach a lower boundary of zero 
 The dollar rose 0 15 percent against a basket of major
currencies while the yen rose 0 1 percent to 95 38 per dollar

 TOKYO  June 9  Reuters    The dollar rose against a basket of

 Sterling regained ground after sliding on Monday as support

adding to uncertainty about his political future 
 Traders said the focus was on whether forthcoming U S  data
would underscore the shift in market expectations towards a
possible Federal Reserve rate increase later this year  which
took hold after last week s jobs data showed that the pace of
U S  job losses slowed sharply in May 
  I think there is a mood among market players of wanting to
take a close look at whether a recovery is really taking hold  
said a currency trader for a Japanese bank 
 Investors are likely to take their cue from indicators such
as U S  retail sales data later this week and moves in U S 
Treasuries  said the trader for a Japanese bank 
 The euro fell 0 3 percent to  1 3860  after dropping to
 1 3806 on trading platform EBS on Monday  its lowest since late
May 
 Sterling slipped 0 4 percent to  1 5994 but was well off

had retreated from Monday s high of 81 466  the highest since May
20 
 The dollar fell against the yen to 98 20 yen  Traders said
the dollar  which had hit a one month high of 98 90 yen on
trading platform EBS on Friday  was dragged down due to selling
by Japanese exporters 
 DOLLAR  U S  YIELDS
 U S  two year yields stood at 1 389 percent  hovering near a
seven month peak hit on Monday 
 Market players said such rises in yields based on shifting
market expectations toward a possible Federal Reserve rate rise
later this year were a positive factor for the dollar 
 On Friday  U S  short term interest rate futures  which track
market expectations for Fed rate policy  had their first
meaningful move in months    bringing forward the possible timing
of a Fed rate hike to late 2009 from early 2010 
 Another factor to consider may be whether investor risk
appetite will strengthen further following a three month rally in
global equities  which came as hopes grew that the worst of the
global recession may be over 
 Such a recovery in risk appetite had eroded safe haven demand
for the dollar and helped push the dollar index down to a low of
78 334 last week  the lowest since last December 
 Market players have taken comfort from signs that economic
activity around the world has stopped worsening  but the absolute
level is still low  said Kimihiko Tomita  head of foreign
exchange for State Street Global Markets in Tokyo 
  Financial markets have jumped the gun and are tilted in the
direction of taking risk   Tomita said 
  But now there may be a bit of a question mark about whether
it is OK to continue with such moves  that this may not be
advisable unless the real economy follows along   Tomita said

 TOKYO  June 9  Reuters    The dollar was steady against a
basket of currencies on Tuesday  staying below a two week high
scaled after U S  jobs data last week stoked expectations for a
Federal Reserve rate rise later this year 
 The euro faced some selling pressure after the Wall Street
Journal reported on its website that the United States is likely
to press European countries to put their banks through more
rigorous public stress tests 
 Data last week showed the pace of U S  job losses slowed
sharply in May  sparking talk that the Federal Reserve may raise
rates later this year and boosting the dollar 
 Traders said they were focusing on economic indicators and
upcoming auctions for U S  debt that could underscore this shift
in market sentiment 
  I would say investors are trying to grasp how the market
will move after U S  Treasury auctions and economic data   said
Yoshihisa Kanzaki  a currency dealer at Shinkin Central Bank 
 There will be an auction of three year U S  Treasury notes
later in the day and auctions of 10 year and 30 year U S 
Treasuries later in the week 
 The dollar index  which measures the dollar s value against a
basket of six major currencies  was steady at 80 770  having
retreated from Monday s high of 81 466  the highest since May 20 
 U S  two year yields stood at 1 378 percent  after rising
above 1 4 percent on Monday for the first time in seven months 
 On Friday  U S  short term interest rate futures  which track
market expectations for Fed rate policy  had their first
meaningful move in months    bringing forward the possible timing
of a Fed rate hike to late 2009 from early 2010 
 The euro dipped 0 1 percent to  1 3889  after falling to
 1 3853 earlier in the day 
 The euro had fallen on Monday to its lowest since late May of
 1 3806 on trading platform EBS  after ratings agency Standard  
Poor s cut Ireland s sovereign credit rating to AA  its second
downgrade in three months 
 Sterling was steady at  1 6051  It was well off Monday s low
of  1 5803  hit when support for Prime Minister Gordon Brown s
ruling Labour Party in European parliament elections on Sunday
plunged to its lowest level in a century  adding to uncertainty
about his political future 
 The yen rose broadly  with the euro slipping 0 6 percent to
136 15 yen 
 The dollar fell 0 5 percent to 98 06 yen  pulling back from a
one month high of 98 90 yen hit on EBS on Friday 
 Traders said the dollar dipped against the yen due to selling
by Japanese exporters  while the euro fell versus the yen on
selling by Japanese institutional investors 
 The strength of investor risk appetite is also in focus
following a three month rally in global equities as hopes grew
that the worst of the global recession may be over 
 The recovery in risk appetite eroded safe haven demand for
the dollar and helped push the dollar index down to a low of

145503,367018,STT,GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Investors swamped by economy  bank woes,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  March 1  Reuters    Two months into 2009 and equity
investors are having a worse time than they did last year  with
global stocks at six year lows and little respite in sight 
 So it is hard to imagine that this week s central bank
interest rate decisions in Britain and the euro zone or the
release of key U S  jobs data will do much to persuade investors
to start buying again 
 Sentiment is essentially being swamped    some might say
drowned    by the deteriorating world economy and continuing
angst about the precarious state of the global financial system 
 As Reuters polls showed last week it has left investors in a
state of high risk aversion and sitting squarely on the
sidelines 
  The combination of doubt about the economic recovery 
further earnings downgrades and looming nationalisation of some
large U S  banks  has  proved a toxic mix for markets   wrote
Joost van Leenders  an asset allocator at Fortis Investments 
 And new problems just keep piling on  Troubles in eastern
and central Europe have now risen high up the agenda amid deep
concern among policy makers about a spillover into the euro zone
banking system 
 In numerical terms  global stocks are actually on track for
a worse year than 2008  As measured by MSCI  they have fallen
nearly 18 percent so far this year  compared with around 8
percent for the same period a year ago 
 It has all rather dampened earlier hopes that the worst of
the financial and economic crisis has passed and that the
much touted green shoots of recovery are about to sprout 
 Banking health remains the main concern  The blue chip Dow
Jones industrial average  for example  was at 12 year lows last
week on concerns about the possible nationalisation of giant
Citigroup 
 The U S  deal on Friday to boost its stake in the bank fell
short of that but the potential still rattled investors 
 
 VAMPIRES 
 That said  many professional investors appear to be keeping
their nerve  with increasing numbers saying they are seeing
value in oversold markets 
 The Reuters polls last week showed hardly any change between
January and February in the portfolio stances of major global
investment houses  Indeed  there was a very slight increase in
exposure to stocks 
 This would suggest that while investors are generally
sticking to the sidelines  they are not being particularly
spooked by the continuing stream of bad news 
 Deeper into the Reuters data  however  were some stark
regional differences  European investors  for example  were by
far the most bearish  hanging on to more than twice the amount
of cash than they normally do 
 One reason for this may be the rising fear that collapsing
economies in so called emerging Europe    the Czech Republic 
Poland  Hungary and so on    will add unbearable strains on the
international banks that have expanded into the region 
 The World Bank  the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development  EBRD  and the European Investment Bank  EIB 
stepped in jointly at the end of last week with a two year plan
to lend up to 25 billion euros   31 7 billion  to shore up banks
and businesses in eastern and central Europe 
 Ripples from this and the weekend meeting of European Union
leaders on the issue will likely be a focus on financial markets
this week  But the issue already has been around for some time 
 Data from financial services specialist State Street show
cross border equity flows into the euro zone at record lows so
far this year 
 The broad DJ STOXX 600 euro zone stock index lost 12 percent
in the first two months of the year 
  The travails in the east  like the vampires of folklore 
are sucking the lifeblood from European markets and investor
sentiment   State Street said 
 
 RATES AND JOBS
 While all this is keeping investors on the back foot 
central banks are still pumping money into the financial system
and taking monetary policy to record lows 
 This week both the Bank of England and the European Central
Bank are expected to cut rates by half a percentage point  That
would take the ECB down to 1 5 percent and the BoE to just 0 5
percent 
 Both are then expected to launch into so called quantitative
easing  essentially using unconventional measures such as buying
assets to get money where it is needed to rescue their
economies 
 These kinds of moves comfort investors in the sense that
they show policymakers taking action  But they also underline
the severity of the situation 
 The new month  in the meantime  brings with it a new raft of
economic data  including the key U S  jobs report on Friday 
 Few investors are expecting much succour from the report 
which not only shows the state of joblessness in the world s
largest economy but also has implications for consumer spending
and saving 
 The number of U S  workers already on jobless benefits is at
a record high  Friday s report is expected to show around
600 000 jobs were lost in February 
 It is said in some parts of Britain that if March enters
like a lion it will leave like a lamb  Investors must be hoping
so

 LONDON  March 6  Reuters    The dollar dropped more than one
percent against a basket of currencies on Friday  reversing
recent sharp gains as investors braced for data that is expected
to show the U S  jobs market took a severe knock in February 
 Economists expect the U S  economy lost a massive 648 000
jobs in February  with the unemployment rate seen rising to a
25 year high  but traders said talk that the figure could be as
many as 1 million has hit the dollar hard 
 Although recent bad economic news has tended to be positive
for the dollar as investors have flocked to the perceived safety
of the U S  currency  analysts said investors  immediate
reaction to talk of such a horrendous number was to sell it 
  The rumour of a very bad number for U S  payrolls data in a
normal world would be good for the dollar  but the knee jerk
reaction this time round has been to sell it   State Street
currency strategist Lee Ferridge said 
 He added that investors were squaring up positions ahead of
the data after recent sharp gains that took the dollar index to
a three year high earlier this week 
 At 0856 GMT  the dollar index fell 1 1 percent to 88 139 as
the euro gained 1 percent against the U S  currency to  1 2695 
 The Swiss franc was a major gainer  with the euro tumbling
to a four month low against the currency  with analysts saying
the Swiss unit has briefly resumed its safe haven status amid
intensifying concerns about a severe global economic downturn  
 The dollar fell 1 3 percent against the Swiss franc to
1 1534 francs  while the euro was down 0 4 percent at 1 4639
francs  having earlier dropped as low as 1 4580 francs 
 The yen also gained  with the dollar falling 0 7 percent to
97 27 yen and the euro losing 0 3 percent to 123 34 
 
 ECONOMIC WOES
 U S  shares tumbled to 12 year lows on Thursday after
General Motors said there were doubts about the heavyweight
carmaker s viability 
 Global economic concerns intensified on Friday as a top
International Monetary Fund official told a UK newspaper the
world s developed economies were in the deepest slump since
World War Two and warned the downturn could last into next year
 
 The comments come after the European Central Bank and the
Bank of England cut interest rates to record lows on Thursday 
with the UK s central bank resorting to unconventional measures
to boost the supply of money in the economy 
 In an accompanying press conference  ECB president
Jean Claude Trichet signalled further rate cuts and painted a
bleak picture on the economy  with staff forecasting the euro
zone may contract by more than 3 percent this year  
 The U S  payrolls data at 1330 GMT will be seen as a key
gauge on the health of the world s largest economy and trading
is expected to be very nervous ahead of the data 
  With that potentially significant non farm payroll report
still to come  further volatility could be seen well into the
afternoon   CMC Markets analyst James Hughes said in a note to
clients 
 Analysts were unconvinced  however  that the latest move
down in the dollar was an indication that the currency could be
starting to lose its safe haven status 
  If the U S  jobs data is really as bad as the speculation
suggests then the reality is that it would very likely be dollar
positive   State Street s Ferridge said

 LONDON  March 6  Reuters    The dollar rolled back sharply
from three year highs on Friday and demand for euro zone
government debt rose as investors fretted that U S  employment
data would be worse than previously forecast 
 Japanese shares tumbled to a fresh 25 year low on worries
about the global banking industry but European shares put in
modest gains 
 The U S  Labor Department is to release one of the most
closely watched U S  indicators later in the day  the monthly
non farm payrolls report 
 Economists expect 648 000 jobs were lost in the United
States in February after 598 000 were shed in January  and see
the unemployment rate rising to a 25 year high of 7 9 percent
from 7 6 percent the previous month 
 The report is significant because it hints at future
consumer confidence    and hence spending    patterns in the
world s largest economy 
 Jitters over the report could be seen most directly on
foreign exchange markets  where the dollar index  a gauge of the
greenback s performance against a basket of currencies  dropped
around 1 percent 
 Trading was subject to intense speculation that the jobs
report could be worse that forecast 
  The rumour of a very bad number for U S  payrolls data in a
normal world would be good for the dollar  but the knee jerk
reaction this time round has been to sell it   State Street
currency strategist Lee Ferridge said 
 As a result of the dollar s weakness  the euro was up around
1 percent at  1 2681 and the dollar lost 0 6 percent to 97 30
yen 
 Euro zone government bonds climbed  extending the previous
session s rally  The two year Schatz yielded 1 163 percent

 By Kirsten Donovan 
 LONDON  March 10  Reuters    The dollar fell against a
basket of currencies on Tuesday  retracing much of the previous
day s sharp gains as investors focused on stock market gains
that have tended to undermine flows into the U S  currency 
 Some easing of wariness towards risk allowed the euro a
technical bounce against the dollar  while sterling lengthened
losses versus the common currency on continued worries about the
health of Britain s banking sector 
 Meanwhile  the yen erased losses and rose versus the dollar 
though doubts about the Japanese currency s status as a safe
port in the global economic storm ensured it kept an overall
defensive tone  traders said 
  We re seeing a bit of a risk on  day  which usually equates
to dollar selling   said State Street Global Markets  strategist
Lee Ferridge  
  But the market is still very fickle and very nervous at the
moment   
 The dollar index  a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies  fell 0 9 percent to 88 483  off last week s
three year high of 89 624 
 European equities rose on Tuesday  with U S  stock market
futures also pointing to a higher open on Wall Street  
 But data remained relentlessy gloomy with industrial output
in Sweden falling 22 9 percent on the year in January  while UK
January industrial output fell at its fastest annual pace since
1981  
 Debt issued by the two countries has sold off since
mid February and Bank of New York Mellon says this could explain
the ongoing underperformance of both the crown and sterling
against the euro in recent weeks  
  Could it be that this is tangible evidence that  despite
the obvious negatives facing the euro zone at present  it still
represents a relative safe haven compared to some of its more
isolated regional neighbours   the bank asked in a note  
 The euro rose 1 25 percent to  1 2767  rebounding from a
three month low of  1 2455 hit last week according to Reuters
data  The euro was also firmer against sterling at 92 04 pence 
off a 5 1 2 week high of 92 18 pence 
 The euro s gains versus the dollar were  briefly dented
after ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi was quoted
as saying the bank was prepared to cut interest rates to zero if
deflation threatens and the economic situation worsens 
  The comments are dovish  but they continue to put some
distance between themselves and any possible quantitative easing
    They continue to dismiss an outright ECB intervention in the
bond market   said Richard McGuire  fixed income strategist at
RBC Capital Markets in London 
 But  ECB Governing Council member Axel Weber  later said he
saw 1 percent as the lower limit for euro zone interest rates 
 
 SHAKY POUND
 The pound managed to recover from a six week low against the
dollar  rising 0 7 percent on the day to  1 3871 
 But the rebound was on shaky ground after it shed 2 percent
on Monday when Lloyds Banking Group intensified sector worries
with its announcement the British government was taking a stake
of up to 77 percent 
 Pressure from the Bank of England s quantitative easing
programme was also reflected in bond markets as the yield on
benchmark 10 year gilts held near its lowest level in more than
50 years  having fallen below 3 percent on Monday 
 The dollar reversed early gains against the yen  last down
0 5 percent at 98 27 yen  but the Japanese currency stayed
weaker versus a broadly stronger euro at 125 50 yen 
 The yen has fallen in the past month as Japan s economy
grapples with diving exports and its worst recession of the
postwar era  Its current account balance swung to the largest
deficit on record in January  adding to selling pressure

   Equities gain on U S  govt plan on toxic assets
   Dollar rises on hopes U S  economy will revive
 
 By Atul Prakash
 LONDON  March 24  Reuters    World stocks hit five week
highs on Tuesday on optimism a U S  plan to purge toxic assets
from banks  balance sheets could ease the misery of the sector 
but the rally also provided investors a chance to take profits 
 The dollar rose against the yen and the euro on hopes the
U S  plan  detailed on Monday by U S  Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner  will revive the world s largest economy 
 This helped the dollar to halt last week s slide  which was
sparked by the Fed s plan to buy government debt as part of a
move to expand its balance sheet 
 The MSCI World index  a gauge of global stocks performance 
rose 0 5 percent after rising to its highest level since
mid February  The index  which fell to a six year low on March
9  has risen in 10 of the last 11 sessions 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose for a
fourth consecutive session and was up 0 4 percent after rising
as much as 1 5 percent earlier  It pared gains as investors took
profits from recent moves that pushed the index up 15 percent
from its 12 year low hit on March 9 
  If this positive momentum can be sustained  and there are
further signs that the credit markets are loosening  we could
see money that had previously sat on the sidelines re entering
the markets   said Chris Hossain  senior sales manager at ODL
Securities 
 Appetite for riskier assets such as equities grew after
the U S  government on Monday offered a raft of incentives for
private investors to help rid banks of up to  1 trillion in
toxic assets that plunged the world economy into crisis 
 Latest euro zone economic data was also encouraging  Key
gauges of services and manufacturing activity suggested the
economic contraction gripping the euro zone eased a little in
March  against expectations  but firms continued to slash jobs
and prices 
 Sentiment also improved after Monday s data showed a
surprise rise in U S  home sales  reviving hopes the battered
housing market could be on a recovery path 
 But analysts said they wanted to see more evidence before
declaring the market has seen its trough  The FTSEurofirst is
still down 11 percent this year after plunging 45 percent in
2008 on a crisis that began with U S  mortgage defaults in 2007
and has pushed much of the world into a deep recession 
  It is way too early to call the end of the bear market  The
financials have still recouped only a little part of the big
losses   said Philippe Gijsels  strategist at Fortis 
  The Geithner plan is certainly a step in the right
direction and should eventually help  but it is not a miracle
either  We will have to see whether the plan will actually
work   he said 
 Analysts said the market could witness more bad news in the
coming months 
  Everyone seems very upbeat and people are calling the end
of the bear market  but we haven t reached the bottom of the
economic cycle    there s at least three months of painful stuff
to come   said David Buik  senior strategist at BGC Partners 
 
 EURO UNDER PRESSURE
 In the currency market  the euro was under pressure as euro
zone policymakers suggested that interest rates in the region
could fall further 
  The initial reaction to Fed quantitative easing was to sell
the dollar  but after the Geithner plan people started thinking
that the U S  is perhaps leading the global economy out of all
this   State Street currency strategist Lee Ferridge said 
  This U S  recovery story benefits the dollar against both
the yen and the euro   he said 
 The dollar index  a gauge of its performance against a
basket of major currencies  was up 0 3 percent at 83 693 
 Euro zone government bond yields marked a five day high 
while U S  Treasuries slipped as stocks extended their rally and
dealers braced for this week s slew of nearly  100 billion of
U S  bond supply  which opens with  40 billion of two year
T Notes on Tuesday 
 European credit derivative indexes rallied for a second day 
after stocks rose sharply  The investment grade Markit iTraxx
Europe index was at 154 basis points  according to data from
Markit  9 basis points tighter versus late Monday 
 In commodity markets  gold slipped on the firmer dollar as
the metal became costlier for holders of other currencies  But
crude oil prices retreated as investors took profits after a 3
percent rally in the previous session

said a trader for a Japanese trust bank  referring to the euro s
1 3 percent slide against the dollar on Tuesday 
 The dollar index saw its biggest weekly drop since 1985 last
week  pummelled after a surprise announcement by the Federal

 The dollar index was steady at 84 081  having come off a

 Although the yen has regained some ground after dropping on
Tuesday to a five month low against the euro and a 4     month
trough versus the Australian dollar  it is likely to stay on the
back foot  said a trader for a Japanese trust bank 
  Its role as a safe haven currency has diminished   the
trader said   There is no reason to buy the yen actively  
  The Australian dollar dipped 0 1 percent against the yen to
68 14 yen  off a 4     month high of 69 60 yen hit on Tuesday 
 The yen s reaction was subdued to data showing Japan s trade
balance returned to a surplus in February for the first time in
five months  The 82 4 billion yen   841 6 million  surplus
contrasted with economists  forecasts for a deficit of 10 9
billion yen 
 The surplus comes after Japan posted its largest deficit ever
in January  when exports fell sharply due to a slowdown in the
global economy 
 But seasonally adjusted data showed a trade deficit for
February and analysts said exports were likely to stay in decline
for a while due to weak overseas demand 
  This data by itself does not offer much reassurance on

 TOKYO  March 25  Reuters    The yen climbed against the euro
and the Australian dollar on Wednesday  getting some respite
after its fall to multi month lows the previous day with Japanese
investors seen selling foreign assets before the financial
year end this month 
 The dollar held on to much of the gains made on Tuesday on
profit taking in the wake of its slide last week  when it

  The rise in the yen today is seen purely as part of a

Nakamura  a trader at Shinkin Central Bank 
  There was no news or a worrisome factor in the market to
back the yen s move  while most of the news in recent days has
been positive for the market   said Nakamura 
 Other traders attributed the yen s rise to Japanese investors
repatriating funds from overseas with the approach of the end of
the financial year on on March 31 
 The euro fell 0 2 percent against the yen to 131 62 yen 
having pulled back from a five month high of 134 50 yen hit on

 These factors helped stocks reverse early gains and soured
sentiment which had improved following Washington s latest  1
trillion bank rescue plans and efforts by central banks around
the world to adopt unconventional steps to ease monetary policy

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 1 percent  
 Analysts noted that a rise in Ifo s expectations index for a
third month in a row offered some positive forward looking
signs  although the situation remained dire in the near term 
  This tentative uptrend means there s still good reason to
expect this series to be at higher levels later this year 
consistent with growth eventually becoming positive again  
Credit Suisse said in a note to clients 
  While there s tentative evidence in this survey that the
outlook for growth later this year is getting less bad  the near

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON  April 15  Reuters    The euro fell against the
dollar on Wednesday after European Central Bank Governing
Council member Axel Weber said the central bank will announce a
package of  non standard measures  in May 
 Speaking in Hamburg  Weber said the measures will be valid
for the rest of this year and into next year  though he noted
that there was  no prominent deflation risk  in the region 
 The comments caused the single currency to turn lower in
very choppy trade 
 Analysts said trade was edgy  with the market lacking
direction as it awaited U S  inflation data at 1230 GMT  as well
as key corporate earnings news from the likes of Citigroup and
JP Morgan later in the week 
 The inflation figures are expected to show the U S  headline
year on year CPI rate turning negative  falling to  0 1 percent
from  0 2 percent in February 
  Trade has been pretty edgy  People are trying to find a
signal but stock futures have been up and down and the market
has not got back into the full swing of things after the Easter
break   State Street currency strategist Lee Ferridge said 
 He said a U S  deflation story may make the headlines  but
it is unlikely to provide clear direction  adding that investors
will also look to the New York Fed manufacturing survey at 1230
GMT for any hints of the economy recovering 
 At 1200 GMT  the euro fell 0 5 percent against the dollar to
 1 3179 and was flat against the yen at 131 05 yen  A 0 2
percent fall in European equities also helped push the euro
lower 
 The dollar rose against the yen meanwhile  gaining 0 7
percent to 99 45 yen 
 With few other drivers at the moment  analysts said
currencies are likely to continue to track developments in
equity markets 
  It only takes a slight improvement in stocks to increase
risk preference and for currencies like sterling and the euro to
do better   said Neil Jones  head of European hedge fund sales
at Mizuho Corporate Bank in London  
 
 STERLING SHINES
 Sterling was the standout performer  jumping to a high of
 1 5037 against the dollar as it surpassed the  1 50 mark for
the first time in three months  while the euro also hit a
six week low of 88 12 pence 
 By 1200 GMT  it had trimmed gains against the dollar to
 1 4953  though the euro was down 1 percent at 88 16 pence 
 The boost came after the UK s Royal Institution of Chartered
surveyors overnight reported that its house price balance rose
to  73 1 in March from  78 1 in February  See 
 Though still indicating sizeable house price falls  the pace
of decline was the slowest in a year  providing some hope that
the UK housing market may be over the worst 
  The strong RICS survey overnight has boosted sterling  It is
higher than it was 12 months ago and people are seeing tentative
signs of green shoots in the UK housing markets   State Street s
Ferridge said

145526,367041,STT,GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Gauging the pain of staying cautious,news,"By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  April 17  Reuters    For long term asset managers
who missed the  green shoots  equity rally over the past six
weeks  the big question is how much of the current rally they
can miss before committing themselves to the upturn 
It has become a  pain trade  for some long term investors as
they  in fear of compounding last year s losses  have stuck with
underweight equity positions just when world stocks have rallied
nearly 30 percent since hitting a six year low in March  
 But these investors now face the choice of either missing
even more gains or  possibly worse  diving in just as the rally
fizzles  The direction next week hinges on a slew of
first quarter earnings reports from major banks and corporates
as well as a closely watched manufacturing survey 
 Even banking stocks  which have been a no go sector for
long term investors    have more doubled since early March 
leading many to think that green shoots of recovery have finally
arrived  Others stick with the view that this is just a rally
within a bear market 
  Investors are fairly poorly positioned to play this rally 
Apocalyptic fears have been removed but there is no bullish
euphoria yet   said Gary Baker  international investment
strategist at Banc of America Securities Merrill Lynch 
  Although they haven t fully embraced the idea that the
worst is over  fund managers can t wait any longer to be proven
wrong  It has become too painful for fund managers to sit on
their underweight positions  on banks   watching these things
double  
 Institutional investors have slowly started cutting
underweight positions in risky assets  
 State Street s cross border equity flows data shows the
United States saw monthly flows soar into 98th percentile of
previous history last week  meaning flows were only higher on 2
percent of prior months in the past 12 years 
  It seems the nightmare may now be ending   the bank said in
a note to clients 
  Institutional investors have welcomed the onset of
quantitative easing in the UK and U S  The start of these
efforts to expand the monetary base coincided with both the
market rallies and the marked uptick in cross border equity
flows  
 Data from EPFR shows net flows into equity funds in Asia
outside Japan and Eastern Europe and the Middle East moved into
positive territory  in a sign that investors are regaining
appetite over riskier emerging market assets 
 However  overall flows into all equity funds remained
negative at  1 4 billion in the week ending Wednesday 
 
 BACK INTO CYCLICALS
 Merrill Lynch s monthly fund managers survey showed a move
back into the banking sector unlocked a widespread shift out of
defensive sectors into cyclicals 
 Managers cut their underweight positions in banks this month
to 26 percent from a record 48 percent in March  Technology is
now the most popular sector globally 
  What is happening suggest that investors have added to risk
by buying some of the cyclical markets    resources  some
industrials   said David Shairp  global strategist at JPMorgan
Asset Management 
 Dirk Wiedmann  head of investments at Rothschild Private
Banking   Trust  likes a broadly neutral asset allocation  while
he is upbeat on the longer term outlook for hedge funds and
commodities    alternative assets which have suffered severely
over the past year 
 He cites that redemptions for the first quarter at one major
hedge fund has been only around 20 30 percent of the levels seen
in the fourth quarter 
  For the skilled managers that survive  the medium and long
term prospects are good  There is a large opportunity set and
there will be less competition  There are already good
opportunities for global macro and directional trading

 By Veronica Brown
 LONDON  Jan 8  Reuters    The dollar and yen rose at the
expense of higher yielding currencies on Thursday as falling
shares tempered risk demand  while the euro came under selling
pressure as dismal data highlighted concerns about a
deteriorating euro zone economy 
 Sterling bounced to three week highs versus the dollar and
the euro after the Bank of England met market expectations with
a 50 basis point interest rate cut to 1 5 percent  continuing
attempts to buffer the UK economy from a deep recession 
 The dollar built momentum versus higher yielding currencies
as worries about the global economy slapped oil prices down some
12 percent on Wednesday  pressuring commodity currencies like
the Australian and New Zealand dollars lower 
 This helped the U S  currency recover some losses suffered
in the previous session after a disastrous reading of U S 
employment  but the dollar fell against the yen  which benefited
from risk aversion as share prices in Asian and Europe fell 
 The dollar hit a session low versus the yen after
disappointing sales figures from Wal Mart Stores Inc  the
world s largest retailer  which also cut its quarterly earnings
outlook on Thursday 
 The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 244 68 points 
or 2 71 percent  to 8 770 42  while stock futures pointed to a
lower Wall Street open later on Thursday 
 Figures on Wednesday showed a 693 000 decline in U S 
private jobs in December  hitting home the view the U S  economy
is deteriorating fast with global reverberation 
  The market is very nervous  You get a couple of good days
where people come out of the woodwork and then the Dow falls and
everyone is away again   said Lee Ferridge  currency strategist
at State Street Global Markets 
  Much will depend on the Dow today  if it comes back we ll
see the commodity currencies come back   he added 
 By 1245 GMT  the dollar was little changed against a
currency basket at 82 073  Yen strength pushed the euro down 1 4
percent to 124 44 yen  while the dollar was down 1 3 percent at
91 38 yen  The Australian dollar was down 1 percent at  0 7033 
 The euro traded 0 1 percent lower at  1 3613  after falling
sliding to a session low of  1 353 according to Reuters data 
The pair hovered within range of a three week low around  1 33
hit earlier in the week 
  The euro was weighed after figures showing an unprecedented
10 6 percent month on month fall in German exports in November
as global demand for cars and other manufactured products have
plummeted due to a global recession 
 A series of weak euro zone economic data further fuelled the
view that the recession is deepening  which may require faster
interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank  The euro zone s
business climate declined much more than expected to an all time
low in December 

 CABLE TURNS TO RUBBER
 Sterling rose against the euro and dollar  while UK rate
futures fell after the Bank of England s 50 basis point cut
fuelled the view that rates may not be cut so aggressively going
forward 
 The BoE said in a statement that  the substantial
depreciation in sterling over recent months may help to moderate
the impact on UK net exports of the slowdown in global growth  
But it added that a weaker pound will raise the cost of imports 
 Sterling rose as high as  1 5290  according to Reuters data 
The euro was down more than 1 percent  hitting a low of 88 81
pence  its lowest since mid December 
  I think it s pretty likely that it was sterling that
decided them to slow down the pace of cuts   said Brian
Hilliard  economist at Societe Generale 
  I still think there s more  rate cuts  in the pipeline 
Notable by its absence was any comment on quantitative easing  I
don t think it s actually on the agenda until they get rates
down to close to zero  
 British front month interest rate futures fell to turn
negative after the decision  Front month contracts traded as
much as 4 ticks lower  having been between 6 and 8 ticks higher
before the announcement

 NEW YORK  Jan 20  Reuters    Barack Obama took office on
Tuesday amid a deep economic downturn  a trillion dollar
federal deficit and a gasping bank sector  and the first
African American to become U S  president vowed to meet the
challenges 
 His aides promised to go to work immediately  armed with
the authority to spend the second half of the  700 billion
financial rescue plan and a proposed stimulus package of  550
billion in spending and  275 billion in tax cuts 
 Stock prices extended losses while Obama spoke as investors
were disappointed they did not hear more specifics regarding
his promises for bold and swift action 
  People were looking for something  new plans  new hopes  
said Joe Saluzzi  co manager of trading at Themis Trading in
Chatam  New Jersey   They didn t hear something new  
 Obama said the country understood it was in the midst of
crisis  mentioning war  a sagging confidence and an economy
that was  badly weakened  a consequence of greed and
irresponsibility on the part of some  
  Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real 
They are serious and they are many  They will not be met easily
or in a short span of time  But know this  America    they will
be met   he said upon taking the oath 
 Obama also hinted at greater regulation  saying  this
crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye  the market
can spin out of control  
 The new president was riding a wave  A CBS News New York
Times poll showed 79 percent of Americans are optimistic about
the next four years 
 But that did not help the Dow  which was down more than 2
percent in early afternoon trade  extending the 2009 slump to
nearly 8 percent 
 Shares in major U S  banks were down double digits after
State Street Corp  the world s biggest institutional asset
manager  reported billions of dollars of unrealized losses in
its commercial paper program and investment portfolio 
 State Street stock plummeted 50 percent while Citigroup 
Bank of America  JPMorgan Chase   Co and and Wells Fargo were
all battered 
  It s very uplifting  Obama s inauguration  but I m not
sure it s sufficient  I don t really see this influencing
medium term investment decisions   said Marc Chandler  head of
global currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman 
  There still is a danger that we are doing too little
rather than too much   he said in reference to the stimulus and
financial rescue plans 
 POUND GETS POUNDED
 Europe s banking index fell to a 14 year low on fears that
lenders will need more state help to raise capital  Shares of
Lloyds dropped 31 percent and Barclays fell 17 percent 
 On Monday  Britain threw its troubled banks a second
multibillion pound lifeline in three months and gave its
central bank approval to pump cash into the ailing economy
because interest rates were close to zero 
 Concerns about the British banking sector pushed the
British pound below  1 39 for the first time since June 2001 
 European shares fell 2 percent despite a
better than expected ZEW analyst and investor sentiment index
report in Germany  The monthly poll of economic sentiment by
the ZEW economic think tank rose to  31 0 from  45 2 in
December 
  This is mostly an expression of hope  The  ZEW  indicator
is still clearly in negative territory  Nothing is changing in
terms of the 2009 recession   said Gerd Hassel  an economist at
BHF Bank 
 The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate 50 basis
points to a 50 year low of 1 percent  the latest effort by the
world s leading economies to combat recession 
 Japan reported consumer confidence plunging to a record low
last month in yet another sign of deepening recession 
 CAR CRISIS
 Except for banking  no sector has been harder hit than
carmakers by the financial crisis  the worst in 80 years 
 Italy s Fiat took a 35 percent stake in Chrysler  launching
a venture designed to secure the beleaguered U S  carmaker s
future 
 The deal aims to give the Italian carmaker the scale it
needs to survive and let Chrysler expand its product portfolio
to include small  less polluting cars 
 Separately  France said it may pump up to 6 billion euros
  7 8 billion  into the country s ailing car industry  Prime
Minister Francois Fillon warned that automakers would have to
safeguard jobs in return 
  There is an emergency  We need a massive response on the
automobile sector s financing   Fillon said 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel  however  said the aid
threatened to distort competition and was not a long term
solution to the struggling sector s problems 
 EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Veheugen said the EU must
watch efforts to rescue U S  carmakers to ensure they do not
disadvantage European manufacturers

145545,367060,STT,RPT WRAPUP 1 All is not absolutely dire in recession hit Europe,news," Refiles to delete extraneous words in first paragraph  
 By Brian Love
 PARIS  Jan 27  Reuters    An unexpected improvement in
German business confidence in January is only one of several
recent positive surprises  but economists still believe it is
too early to say the European economy has hit bottom 
 Marginal as it was  the rise in Germany s attention grabbing
Ifo index of business morale was the first in eight months and
it came days after an unexpected improvement in investor morale
in Europe s biggest economy  as measured by the ZEW index 
  It s almost too good to be true   said Holger Schmieding 
chief Europe economist at Bank of America in London 
 The index produced by the Ifo research institute  which is
based on regular soundings of some 7 000 companies  would need
to improve for three months running before people stand up and
really take notice  said Schmieding 
 Some were more upbeat   Today s Ifo index shows that the
aggressive German fiscal answer to the worst recession since
World War Two and the ongoing monetary easing have possibly
turned on the light at the end of the tunnel   said Carsten
Brzeski at ING Financial Markets 
 There are some other surprises too  and they are not limited
to Europe s largest economy 
 Belgium s business sentiment indicator  widely regarded as a
bellwether for the health of the broader European economy  rose
too in January  contrary to economist forecasts 
 In France  the euro zone s second biggest economy  business
morale stabilised in January  albeit at a record low but again
better than economists were assuming 
 In the euro zone s services sector  business expectations
for the year ahead have risen for two straight months according
to the widely watched PMI surveys of private companies 
 While those expectations still reflect a slowdown in
business prospects in the year ahead  they also suggest that a
bottom in activity was hit in the final quarter of last year 
 The snippets of not so awful news on confidence ratings go
beyond the business sector too 
 A survey of consumers in 13 European countries suggests that
confidence hit a low in 2008 when oil prices were heading for
the peak reached in July and that if anything might improve this
year because oil  and thus fuel bills  have since retreated 
 That survey  conducted in December for the French consumer
credit company Cetelem  involved soundings from 10 000 people
and showed a small drop in the percentage of people who expect
to raise their spending this year 
 Again it was more a story of things perhaps not being quite
as bad as many feared in the euro zone  where 2009 is forecast
to be the first year since monetary union that the economic
output of the entire zone will actually shrink 
 Indeed  Italian consumer morale rose unexpectedly in January
after three consecutive falls in monthly surveys by research
institute ISAE  whose latest update on Tuesday suggested too
that the fall in oil prices was the key influence 
  It is possible that consumers  views have been positively
influenced by the reduction in price tensions   ISAE said  a
reference to the recent sharp fall in inflation driven by
reductions in fuel and food prices 
 ISAE s seasonally adjusted consumer confidence index rose to
102 6  from 99 6  comfortably topping analysts  forecasts yet
again even if it remains well below its long term average of
around 113 
 Italy is the only country in the Cetelem survey where
consumers  purchasing power has actually fallen in the 10 years
to end 2007 
 And they have little to cheer about in the outlook for GDP 
with the gross domestic product forecast to drop 1 9 percent
this year in the euro zone and 1 8 percent in the 27 country
European Union 
 Readings for consumer confidence remain weak and the picture
mixed to an extent that economists see little reason to take the
latest positive upsets with a large pinch of salt 
 Marco Annunziata  chief economist at UniCredit bank  advises
people to brace for further disappointments in the months head 
  I do believe we will touch bottom between this quarter and
the next but I think these latest signals might be a short term
rebound rather than a turning point   he said 
 
 AND INVESTORS TOO   
 On the investment front  there are signs that optimism is
growing but that few people are prepared to act on it yet 
 Merrill Lynch s latest monthly survey of fund managers  for
example  showed a substantial rise in the poll s indicator of
economic growth expectations  to 30 in January from a low of 17
only last October  
 But investors were hanging on to cash  the traditional
allocation during times of uncertainty 
 At the same time  State Street s global investor confidence
index hit a four month high this month 
 There are also very tentative signs that some investors are
willing to take on risk if the price is seen as right 
 High yield bond funds tracked by investment researchers EPFR
Global  for example  have recorded eight consecutive weeks of
net inflows 
 This  however  must be ranged against a net  8 1 billion in
outflows from equity funds in the third week of Janaury 
 MSCI s main world stock index is down around 8 percent from
January  albeit still at levels that are higher than a low last
November 
 One thing that is clearly not improving is how confident
ordinary people feel about business  according to a survey
commissioned by public relations firm Edelman 
 Almost two thirds of people said they became less trusting
of business last year  according to the survey  conducted from
early November to mid December and involving 4 475 people with
relatively high incomes and education 
 In Ireland  the Celtic Tiger economy that is now the country
in the deepest recession in the euro zone  83 percent reported a
loss of faith in business  according to the survey  which
spanned 20 countries

145546,367061,STT,ANALYSIS Flickers of optimism as stocks climb despite gloom,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Feb 6  Reuters    German industrial output slumps to
its worst level since unification  U S  monthly job losses are
the biggest for 34 years  Equity markets rally 
 Something is going on in financial markets that suggests
investors may believe that a bottom is here or near for the
global economic downturn and the stock market collapse 
 Reaction to the two bits of gloomy data on Friday was nearly
nonchalant  MSCI s all country world stock index  boosted by
gains across Wall Street  Europe and Asia  headed for its
seventh positive session in the past 10 
 What appears to be happening is that a scattered series of
improvements in macroeconomic data  some of which is just not as
bad as expected  is outweighing more dire reports 
 It has combined with a growing faith that government bailout
and stimulus plans will work  On Friday  markets were driven
forward by growing hopes that a  900 billion plus U S  economic
package would be passed by Congress soon 
 The gist of the flickering optimism is that the much touted
green shoots of economic recovery may be about to pop up out of
the recessionary mire 
  For those of an optimistic bent  credit markets have    
begun to function  money supply is up and investment flows into
emerging markets remain positive   State Street said in a note
that otherwise showed highly cautious investment flows 
  This might yet prove to be the last hurrah of extreme risk
aversion   it said 
 The evidence for optimism comes from two places  First 
there have been better than expected economic reports 
 Arguably the chief among these was a rise in China s
official manufacturing index  which was coupled with a surge in
bank lending and a comment from the central bank that government
stimulus shows some signs of early success 
 China s economic recovery is widely seen as a crucial
element in any global upswing 
 Other relatively upbeat reports have included an unexpected
improvement in Germany s business confidence and Belgium s
bellwether equivalent  and a surprise surge in U S 
existing home sales 
 The Baltic Exchange Dry Index  a proxy for world trade  is
up more than 100 percent for the year so far 
 
 RELATIVITY THEORY
 Jean Claude Trichet  the European Central Bank president 
has noticed 
  There have been tentative signs of stabilisation in some
survey data  albeit at historically low levels   he said while
holding rates steady on Thursday 
 Improvements have also been noted within the battered
financial sector  Citi Private Bank told its clients this week
that seven out of nine indicators it has designated as
 signposts  to recovery improved in January 
 Among them were a narrowing LIBOR OIS spread  suggesting an
easing of money market tension  and an overall better reading
from Citi s proprietary financial conditions index based on
lower energy costs and growing money supply 
 The second optimism boost has essentially been the fact that
equity markets also appear to have bottomed or be bottoming
after last year s massive falls 
 The MSCI world index is trading in a range above the trough
it hit last November  a low it has not really threatened to sink
to again despite a bearish January 
 This has firms such as the giant investor BlackRock saying
that equities are in a zone that offer reasonable prices 
 Wealth managers at Credit Suisse  meanwhile  are urging
clients to be a bit less cautious  They have cut back on
defensive stocks  for example  and become a bit more positive
about cyclicals that do better when economies improve 
  There are signs of the beginning of an  economic  bottoming
out process   Giles Keating  head of global research at Credit
Suisse Private Bank  told Reuters Global Investing blog
   
  There is deep value out there in some equities   he said 
 
 CAUTIONARY TALE
 Not all the news  or course  has been conducive to this
tentative optimism  as the U S  and German data showed on
Friday 
 Many investors are also quick not to rule out deeper losses
on world equity markets 
 Even as Keating was painting a picture of improving markets 
for example  he said it was  unlikely to be realised in a smooth
process  
 Investment surveys also show little in the way of risk
appetite 
 State Street said its institutional investor clients
remained in extreme risk aversion territory while Reuters 
latest asset allocation polls showed equity holding at a series
low and money being held in safer cash and bonds 
 An optimist  however  would say that it is exactly when
things are at their gloomiest that things start to turn

 LONDON  Feb 26  Reuters    The dollar slipped against a
basket of currencies on Thursday as stock markets rallied while
the British pound was boosted after the launch of a bank
insurance scheme for toxic assets 
 However  the dollar held its gains against the yen as
worries over the health of the Japanese economy sent the yen to
a three month low 
 U S  President Barack Obama forecast a  1 75 trillion budget
deficit for the world s largest economy  amounting to 12 3
percent of GDP    a figure that analysts said could prove dollar
negative 
  In the short term there seems to be some additional concern
over the size of the budget at  1 75 trillion   said David Page 
economist at Investec in London  
  The overall outlook for the dollar is to continue to trade
along the line of where sentiment goes  rather than these
numbers  We don t think the Obama budget is going to have much
of an impact on the dollar over the course of the day   Page
said 
 The dollar was down half a percent against a basket of
currencies at 87 426    reflecting a slight rise in risk seeking
as reflected in stock market gains 
 World stocks as measured by MSCI s all country index rose
0 6 percent  on the day to 191 47  while futures showed U S 
stocks were set for a positive start 
 The euro was up 0 7 percent at  1 2794 
  Euro dollar is the best risk on or risk off barometer now 
and that s a little bit stronger   said Lee Ferridge  an FX
strategist at State Street Global Markets 
   U S  stock  futures are up and the news in the UK this
morning has generally been seen as a positive   he added 
 Sterling was up 0 42 percent against a broadly weaker dollar
at  1 4258 after Britain launched a scheme which could end up
insuring more than 500 billion pounds worth of toxic assets in a
bid to get lending in the recession hit economy moving again 
 The scheme came after Royal Bank of Scotland unveiled a
bumper 24 billion pound loss 
  Germany s chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday that
euro zone states will continue to show solidarity to each other 
her strongest signal that Germany may be prepared to help weaker
members of the bloc 
 
 SO LONG SAFE HAVEN
 Data showing portfolio flows out of Japan last week
underscored the yen s loss of favour as a safe haven bid  with
many now discussing how far it can fall as technical sell
signals fuel negative yen sentiment 
 The yen has shed more than 10 percent since hitting a
13 year high of 87 10 yen per dollar in January  and short term
speculators have been forced to unwind bets that it would
revisit that level  helping push the currency even lower 
 The dollar rose as high as 98 00 yen according to Reuters
data  its highest since mid November  and was last up 0 12
percent on the day at 97 85 yen 
   We are seeing the yen selling off quite sharply  We are
pencilling in somewhere over 100 110 by mid year   said Page at
Investec     
 The euro climbed 0 5 percent to 125 59 yen    a seven week
high 
 Bank of Japan board member Tadao Noda said on Thursday the
economy was worsening more than the central bank had forecast in
January 
 The Australian dollar struck a seven week high of 63 73 yen

records on financial markets  many of them unwelcome  Here are a
few of them 
 STOCK MARKETS
    MSCI s all country world stock index  was
down 19 9 percent for the month  It was the largest monthly fall
in the benchmark s 20 year history in its current form 
    Despite losses on Friday  however  the index was up more
than 11 percent for the week of Oct  27 to 31  scoring the best
performance in the 20 years 
    MSCI s emerging market index   down around 28
percent in October  was having its worst month since August
1998  during the Russian debt crisis 
    October also saw the worst monthly performance ever for
Japan s Nikkei average   The pan European FTSEurofirst
300  fell 12 7 percent on the month  its biggest monthly
fall since September 2002  The U S  S P 500  posted its
worst monthly performance since the October 1987 Wall Street
crash 
    The VIX index   which measures volatility on the
S P 500 through options  hit its highest level since at least
1990 during the month 

 CURRENCIES
    The dollar index   which tracks the greenback
against a basket of major currencies  had its strongest month
since March 1991  up nearly 8 percent 
    The euro  had its worst performance against the
dollar since the single European currency s inception in 1999 
    The dollar fell around 7 percent against the Japanese yen
  the largest monthly fall since December 1998 
    Sterling  saw its biggest monthly drop against the
dollar since 1992 when the pound was forced out of the European
Union s exchange rate mechanism 
 
 FIXED INCOME
    The TED spread between three month U S  deposit rates and
three month Treasury bills hit a record wide of about 464 basis
points on Oct 10  according to Morgan Stanley data 
    Two year euro zone bond yields  hit a four year
low as investors piled in search of relative safety 
    The yield curve between euro zone two  and 10 year
government bonds hit its steepest level since March 2005 as the
short end outperformed longer dated paper 
    The investment grade Markit iTraxx Europe index
 widened to an all time record level on Oct  24 and
also had a record one day increase 
    The Markit iTraxx Crossover index   made up
of 50 mostly  junk  rated credits  also widened to an all time 
record level 
 
 COMMODITIES
    The Reuters Jefferies CRB index   a benchmark for
global commodities  fell more than 22 percent in October  its
worst month on record  The next worst month was September  when
it fell 11 8 percent 
    The price of New York crude oil  fell more than 32
percent  setting up October as a record monthly slide 

 INVESTOR CONFIDENCE

month to its lowest level in the more than 10 years it has been
compiled   IDn nLL107364

145566,367081,STT,Investor morale at record low in Nov State Street,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Nov 18  Reuters    Investor confidence fell to its
lowest level on record for the second month in a row in November
as a flight from riskier assets continued to grip financial
markets  State Street said on Tuesday 
 The U S  financial services firm said  however  that the
rate of decline in confidence had levelled off somewhat after
October s dramatic tumble 
 The global State Street Investor Confidence Index fell to
57 0 in the month from 58 4 in October  upwardly revised from
58 2  The figure for September was 75 7 
 November s level was the lowest recorded in the more than 10
years for which State Street has compiled the index 
 Despite this  Ken Froot  the Harvard University professor
who co developed the index for State Street  found some
positives in the latest data  given a far greater fall in
sentiment a month earlier 
 MSCI s main world stock index has fallen more than 17
percent since the last index was compiled  but the index s
decline was relatively modest 
  Coming on the heels of last month s dramatic decline  this
month s readings provide a measure of relief   Froot said 
  While market prices saw further write downs on the
realisation that fundamentals have deteriorated substantially in
the face of a looming recession  institutional investors did not
react as strongly as last month to these changing
circumstances  
 Confidence among North American investors was essentially
flat  declining to 49 9 from October s revised level of 50 0 
 State Street said the drivers of the decline in overall
sentiment were European investors  whose confidence fell to 73 6
from 79 5  and Asian investors  among whom sentiment slipped to
82 3 from 87 8 
  Last month s decline in North American investor confidence
foreshadowed the decline in U S  consumer confidence to a record
low in October  said State Street s Paul O Connell  another
co developer 
  The fact that North American institutional investors did
not accelerate further the pace of their deleveraging this month
could be seen in a positive light   he said 
 The index is extrapolated from movements in  14 trillion of
assets State Street holds as custodian for institutional
investors

145567,367082,STT,World recession is here Merrill fund manager poll,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Nov 19  Reuters    Investors believe the global
economy is now firmly in recession and that it is not going to
come out of it for some time  a poll by Merrill Lynch showed on
Wednesday 
 As a result  fund managers are embracing defensive assets
such as utility stocks  government bonds and cash  the monthly
survey for November found 
 But it also showed some slight indications of a levelling
off of recent bearish trends 
  Last month we saw a very big capitulation trade   said Gary
Baker  Merrill s head of EMEA equity strategy   The results of
this  new  survey are a  we are strongly in recession  we are
not moving towards it and b  it is here to stay  
 The poll showed that 84 percent of fund managers now believe
the world is in recession   up from 69 percent on October and 44
percent in September 
 At the same time  67 percent said that the global economy
would weaken over the next 12 months  Only 22 percent saw it
improving 
 The poll was taken between Nov  7 and 13  a period when
global stocks fell around 13 percent  oil plunged by a third and
and the world s main commodities index  fell 14 percent 
 The Merrill data showed this was clearly reflected in
investment positioning 
 Investors were embedded in defensive stocks such as
pharmaceuticals  consumer staples  telecommunications and
utilities 
 On a regional basis  equities investors also favoured U S 
stocks because of a better quality of earnings potential  
  I would call this a hunker down trade   Baker said 
 
 SIGNS OF LIFE 
 Despite the overall gloom in the report  there were one or
two signs for optimists to grab hold of 
 The percentage of fund managers who were underweight
equities dropped to 54 percent from 62 percent in October  for
example  while those overweight in bonds dropped to 37 percent
from 46 percent 
 A run on emerging market equities also appeared to have
levelled off with 30 percent underweight versus 36 a month
earlier 
 In currencies  meanwhile  more respondents said the Japanese
yen was overvalued than said it was undervalued for the first
time in the poll s history  Yen strength has been an indicator
of global risk aversion 
 Overall  Merrill s risk and liquidity indicator  drawn from
the poll s findings  improved slightly 
 These kinds of modest moves would mesh with State Street s
investor confidence index  which was released on Tuesday 
 That index hit a record low in November  but its decline was
far less pronounced that the month before  perhaps suggesting a
bottoming out   ID nLI447129

145568,367083,STT,GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Wanted  catalysts for buying,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Nov 23  Reuters    Many financial assets across the
world are looking cheap after the market ructions of the past
year but investors in general have yet to rediscover the impulse
to buy 
 The mood appears to be so negative that even the odd bit of
good news is quickly shrugged off by market players 
 Consider  for example  last week s decision by Saudi Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal to increase his stake in battered Citigroup
because the bank s shares were  dramatically undervalued  
 A statement of confidence from a major investor  Definitely 
Yet shares in Citigroup closed down 26 percent on that day 
 With global stocks as measured by the MSCI index having
halved in price over the past 12 months  many investors are
looking for a catalyst to bring them back into the market 
 This is proving highly elusive  given the drumbeat of bad
economic news and the still wobbly financial system 
 Around 250 economists across Group of Seven nations told
Reuters in a poll last week that they expected major economies
to be in recession for as long as five quarters 
 The Federal Reserve said the U S  economy would contract
until at least mid 2009 
 And the number of major layoffs announced across the world
since September has now risen to at least 261 000 jobs    hardly
conducive to a quick turnaround in consumer confidence 
 The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development
will give its latest view of the state of the world economy on
Tuesday 
 What many investors may need before they re engage with
riskier markets again is to see the trough of the investment
cycle 
 The problem is  that is not always known until well after it
has been reached  Indeed  the bottom may already be here 
  We are in the process of bottoming  but it is a process not
a single event   said Michael O Sullivan  director of global
asset allocation at Credit Suisse s private bank   We are likely
to do that for the next month or so  
 O Sullivan reckons investors will want to see a lot of
things take place before a new investment cycle kicks off 
including continued improvements in credit markets  a pickup in
consumer confidence  an end to the U S  housing slide and the
VIX index below 50 
 The latter  sometimes called the fear gauge  can be seen as
a measurement of expected stock market volatility  It is
currently trading around 80 
 
 LIGHT AHEAD 
 Perhaps reflecting this idea of markets bottoming  investors
enter this week with a few ever so slight signs of improvement
in sentiment 
 Last week  for example  State Street s global investor
confidence index hit a record low  but the November decline was
small compared with a tumble in October  North American investor
confidence levelled off almost completely 
 Within a very gloomy Merrill Lynch fund manager survey 
meanwhile  was a finding that fund managers had moved less
underweight stocks than a month earlier    that is  they were
still negative about them  but less so than before 
 They were also less positive about bonds and cash  both of
which are key defensive plays 
 In currencies  meanwhile  more respondents to the Merrill
poll said the Japanese yen was overvalued than said it was
undervalued for the first time since the current poll was
launched about 7 1 2 years ago  Yen strength has been a key
indicator of global risk aversion 
 If there is a trend in this  it may become clearer on
Thursday when Reuters releases its global asset allocation polls
for November  Last month s polls    which survey institutional
investors in the United States  Britain  continental Europe and
Japan    showed record low exposure to stocks and a high for
cash 
 All this may be small beer  however  State Street reckons
the real turning point for markets will not come until it sees
its institutional investor clients turn back into buyers 
 Flows suggest they are not yet doing so  it says 
 
 DARKEST AT DAWN 
 This week s focus is likely to be on banks  oil and
earnings 
 Citigroup s troubles have come just when investors had begun
to think that the worst of the financial side of the crisis was
over    albeit to be replaced by a global recession 
 The bank has begun talks with the U S  government as its
plummeting share price raises doubts about its ability to
survive  a person familiar with the matter said last week 
 As for oil  its price has returned to the headlines because
of its steep fall as deteriorating economies drain global
demand  The price of crude dipped below  50 a barrel last week 
marking a rough 65 percent decline since July 
 This has combined with other price weakness to lead some
investors and policy makers to see another problem heading their
way    deflation 
 On the corporate front  third quarter earnings remain mixed 
with Thomson Reuters data showing more than half of European
company reports so far coming in under expectations 
 But with gloom can come opportunity  Societe Generale
analyst James Montier  a well known bear  reckons value is
growing on many stock markets 
 Looking at such measures as dividend yield to corporate debt
yield  he finds that more than 10 percent of European  Japanese
and British large cap stocks are a good deal

145569,367084,STT,ANALYSIS Sentiment data hint share markets close to bottom,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Nov 27  Reuters    You never know when a market hits
bottom until well after the fact  but there have been a series
of hints over the past few weeks that stock market investors may
be flirting with one 
 For one thing  volatility is easing  The Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index   or VIX  is down about
8 percent for the month and around 38 percent below its 2008
peak hit last month 
 A series of sentiment and flow indicators have also
suggested this month that  while major investors remain very
gloomy about the world around them  they are not getting much
gloomier 
 On Thursday  Reuters asset allocation polls showed that 
though leading investment houses continued to hold minimal
levels of stocks in their portfolios  they had not reduced
exposure in November 
 The polls of 45 firms across the world showed equities rose
a statistically insignificant 0 1 percent month on month in an
average balanced portfolio  Allocations were still well below
the roughly 60 percent long term average for stocks  but they
had levelled 
 This picture of gloomy but not gloomier investors also
emerged from other monthly surveys 
 State Street s investor confidence index for the month hit
its lowest level in its more than 10 year history  But the
month on month decline was a fraction of what was seen the
previous month 
 The custodian bank  which compiles its index from the buying
and selling patterns of its clients  said institutional
investors were not reacting as strongly to deteriorating
economic fundamentals as they had been 
  This month s readings provide a measure of relief   index
co developer Ken Froot said 
 
 BABY STEPS
 Also gloomy  but with the odd shaft of light  was Merrill
Lynch s monthly poll of some 180 fund managers across the world 
released on Nov  19 
 Although the poll showed investors currently believe the
global economy is in recession and it is not going to come out
of it for some time  there were signs of asset allocation shifts
reflecting stronger risk appetite 
 The percentage of fund managers who were underweight
equities dropped to 54 percent from 62 percent  for example  and
a run on emerging market equities appeared to have levelled off
with 30 percent underweight versus 36 a month earlier 
 Overall  Merrill s risk and liquidity indicator  drawn from
the poll s findings  improved slightly 
 All this may be small beer  but it fits with an increasing
number of investors who are arguing that  after falls of more
than 50 percent on many stock markets over the past 18 months 
there are bargains out there 
 Fortis Investments said this week that one of its tactical
funds was moving back into equities and high yield bonds in part
because of value 
  For equities  our technical indicator showed signs of an
oversold situation  whilst the investment sentiment model had
moved to double plus   said fund manager Matthias Scheiber 
  We were waiting for panic and that s what we saw in
September and October   he said  referring to sharp equity
market losses in those months 
 Templeton Asset Management s emerging markets funds are
betting on a market recovery early next year  with MSCI s
benchmark emerging market equity index  having lost
almost 60 percent this year 
  Emerging markets have gone very far down and are now back
to levels we saw in 2003  We think all these  government
stimulus  programmes will start to have an impact in the early
part of next year and then we will see a rebound   said emerging
markets guru and Templeton executive chairman Mark Mobius 
 
 IT S A PROCESS
 This siren s song has been heard before  of course  and
there is nothing to say that the signs of a levelling off and
even renewed investor appetite will automatically lead to an
eventual bounce in equities 
 The bear market that began last year has already had a
number of bounces  including a more than 20 percent rise between
the end of October and beginning of November for the MSCI
all country world stock index  
 There is also little in the way of succour to be had from
macroeconomic news  although large stimulus packages and a wave
of rates cuts by central banks across the world are doubtless
building some confidence 
 As analysts point out  bottoming out after steep market
falls is a process rather than a specific event  Although in
retrospect a bottom price can be identified  it tends not to be
spotted at the time 
 From a process standpoint  the bottom of the last bear
market  in 2002 3  came over a roughly five month period

145577,367092,STT,POLL Malaysian growth prospects weaken sharply,news,"By Varsha Tickoo
 KUALA LUMPUR  Dec 11  Reuters    Malaysia s economy is
expected to deteriorate more sharply next year than earlier
anticipated because of the global economic crisis  a Reuters
poll shows 
 Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 3 0 percent
in 2009  according to the median of a poll  down from a
forecast of 5 0 percent in a September poll  reflecting weaker
demand at home and from abroad 
 Inflation is seen at 3 5 percent for the year  lower than
the previous forecast of 4 4 percent  mainly due to falling
commodities prices  and analysts said this could lead to
further interest rate cuts 
 But easing commodities prices coupled with waning demand
have weighed on Malaysia s exports  which fell for the first
time in 17 months in October from a year earlier  Exports are
equivalent to more than 100 percent of Malaysia s GDP 
  The global downturn in demand pulled down Malaysian
exports in October  along with the drag from lower commodity
prices  Indeed  data from around the world suggests a
significant slowdown in global activity  and Malaysia will not
be immune   said David Cohen at Action Economics 
 With inflation easing and concern shifting to lagging
growth  Malaysia last month took monetary and fiscal steps to
stimulate its economy 
 The central bank eased its key rate by 25 basis points  its
first move in 2     years  The government set aside 7 billion
ringgit   1 9 billion  for various infrastructure projects and
said it was open to more liberalisation 
 The central bank has said it is  flexible  in terms of
policy  and economists expect monetary easing to continue amid
the grim outlook for growth in Malaysia  with several
forecasting a further cut of 50 basis in the first quarter of
2009 
 The central bank did not change rates earlier this year
when inflation hit near 27 year peaks in July and August 
Inflation has since cooled  and with growth its main concern 
the bank cut rates to 3 25 percent 
  Inflation pressures are easing  and like central banks
around the world  this should allow further interest rate cuts
by the Bank Negara over the coming months   said Cohen 
 The ringgit is seen weakening to 3 71 to the dollar by the
end of June 2009  compared to a forecast of 3 40 ringgit in
September 
 It has depreciated more than 9 percent against the dollar
this year as of Dec 5

145578,367093,STT,Emerging FX Peso  baht at 2 mth highs on Fed rate cut view,news,"TAIPEI  Dec 16  Reuters    The Philippine peso and Thai
baht hit their highest levels in two months against the dollar
on Tuesday as the U S  currency fell broadly in anticipation
the Federal Reserve will cut rates to near zero to buffer an
economy in recession 
 The Singapore dollar also hit its highest in nearly two
months  as investors sold the U S  dollar on expectations the
Federal Reserve will announce it is halving its policy rate to
0 5 percent later in the day 
 The Philippine peso was one of the biggest gainer as it
firmed 0 7 percent to hit as high as 47 31 to the U S  dollar 
the strongest level since mid October  as the country swung to
a surplus in its balance of payments in November 
 On Tuesday  the central bank said the Philippines posted a
balance of payments surplus of  19 million in November 
bouncing back from a deficit of  1 195 billion in October 
 The Thai baht and the Singapore dollar scaled to a 1    
month high of 34 77 and 1 469 respectively  while the Taiwan
currency was hit a one month peak of around 33 
  The U S  dollar is on a downward trend in the region  
said a forex dealer in Bangkok   For the Thai baht  the new
prime minister was a supporting factor as that meant that the
political issue was resolved for now  
 The market expects the Federal Reserve to halve its
benchmark federal funds rate to near zero and unveil other
measures to try and stave off a recession in the world s
largest economy 
 In Thailand  the market welcomed the country s new prime
minister  with the central bank governor quoted as saying in
Hong Kong that his appointment was a step towards establishing
political stability 
 The South Korean won was up by more than 1 percent at
1 348 4 to the U S  dollar after last month s sharp sell off 
though the market was cautious ahead of more U S  data
releases 
 State Street said in a report that the won had room to
recover after being undervalued this year 
  Our value metric implies extreme currency undervaluation
comparable to the Asian currency crisis  while the outlook on
the balance of payments continues to improve   State Street
said
