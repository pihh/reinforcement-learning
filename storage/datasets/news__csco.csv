215542,437058,CSCO,Cisco gives tepid current quarter forecast  sees weak client spending,news," Reuters    Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  gave a lackluster forecast for third quarter revenue and profit on Wednesday and said it continued to expect a pause in customer spending given the current macroeconomic environment  sending its shares down 4  
The company forecast adjusted profit of 79 cents to 81 cents per share  the midpoint of which was in line with analysts  estimate 
Revenue in the current quarter is expected to drop 1 5  to 3 5   which translates to  12 51 billion to  12 77 billion  according to Reuters  calculations  Analysts are expecting revenue of  12 62 billion 
 We are seeing longer decision making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons  including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues   Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said on a post earnings call 
  Customers  are just a little cautious and trying to see what s going on  
Cisco s infrastructure unit  which includes its traditional business of supplying switches and routers  posted an 8  drop in revenue to  6 53 billion 
The business has struggled as customers increasingly prefer using cloud based services offered by companies such as Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and  Microsoft Corp   NASDAQ MSFT  instead of upgrading their networks and servers 
Cisco also reported revenue declines across all its geographies  including a 5  drop in Americas  its biggest market that accounts for about 58  of its revenue 
Broad weakness in orders will likely be a multi quarter problem  Needham analyst Alex Henderson said 
Sales in its application software unit fell 8  to  1 35 billion  while its fast growing security business   which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems   rose 9  to  748 million 
Revenue fell 3 5  to  12 billion in the second quarter ended Jan  25  but still beat analysts  estimate of  11 98 billion

OperatorWelcome to Cisco s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call  At the request of Cisco  today s conference is being recorded  If you have any objections  you may disconnect  Now  I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora  Head of Investor Relations  Ma am  you may begin Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Michelle  Welcome everyone to Cisco s second quarter fiscal 2020 quarterly earnings conference call  This is Marilyn Mora  Head of Investor Relations and I m joined by Chuck Robbins  our Chairman and CEO and Kelly Kramer  our CFO  By now  you should have seen our earnings press release  A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call  Income statements  full GAAP to non GAAP reconciliation information  balance sheets  cash flow statements  and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website  Throughout this conference call  we will be referencing both GAAP and non GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders  unless stated otherwise  All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year over year basis The matters we will be discussing today include forward looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2020  They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC  specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10 K and 10 Q  which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements  With respect to guidance  please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details  Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter  unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure  With that  I ll now turn it over to Chuck Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Marillyn and good afternoon everyone  As we told you last quarter and still see now  the feedback from our customers is that they remain strongly committed to both our products and services  However  like many in our industry  we are seeing longer decision making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues  The good news is  once this uncertainty passes for our customers  we expect to see spending recover as technology continues to be at the heart of all they do  You ll see in our numbers this quarter that we continue to make progress on several key metrics including our shift to more software and subscriptions with 72  of our software now being sold as a subscription  While we still have a lot more work to do  I firmly believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us  The long term secular growth trends of 5G  WiFi 6  400 gig and the shift to the cloud remain and we expect to benefit from them This is a multi year transformation and we are managing our business well while staying focused on helping our customers build simpler  more secure  and cost effective networks  The broad adoption of multi cloud and modern application environments is changing how the world s largest networks are built  operated  and secured and Cisco is at the center of this transition  We have made significant investments in the development of software  silicon  and optics  the building blocks for the Internet of the future  We believe this strategy will change the economics of how the Internet will be built to support 5G  400 gig  and the demands of the future while helping our customers innovate and move faster than ever before  In December  we introduced Cisco Silicon One  a first ever single unified silicon architecture and the Cisco 8000 carrier class router family built on Silicon One as well as our new IOS XR7 operating system  We also announced new flexible purchasing options that enable customers to consume our technology however they choose  We also collaborated closely with several of the largest web scale and SP companies throughout the development process  Their participation in our launch demonstrates their strong support of our strategy as well as our commitment to continued innovation  Our goal is to accelerate the deployment of next generation Internet infrastructure by offering our customers choices of components white box or integrated systems in a flexible consumption model Now  let me share a brief update on our businesses  starting with infrastructure platforms  As the global leader in networking  we believe we are well positioned with our intent based networking portfolio given the strategic investments we ve been making  Over the past several quarters  we ve made tremendous progress integrating automation  analytics  and security across our enterprise networking portfolio while at the same time shifting to a subscription based model  A great example of our success is the ongoing strong adoption of our Catalyst 9000 platforms  We continue to extend our secure SD WAN solutions as customers move more applications to the cloud  To do this  we are actively engaging with web scale companies to help our customers extend their wider networks to the cloud and secure their business applications  Recently  we announced integration with Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN and Office 365 along with a deeper partnership with Amazon Web Services to deliver highly secure end to end connectivity and better application performance Now to security  we had another solid quarter with strength across our advanced threat and cloud based solutions including Duo and Umbrella  which are important growth drivers of our business  We continue to see significant opportunity as we execute on our strategy to deliver an integrated security platform  As the market moves to a multi cloud environment and the need for visibility grows  we re benefiting from our strong position as our customers  most trusted partner  Our differentiated end to end approach across the network  cloud  and endpoint is winning customers with 100  of the Fortune 100 now using one or more of Cisco s security solutions  This quarter  we expanded our security portfolio from the cloud to the edge  We brought to market an integrated IoT architecture providing enhanced visibility  insights  and threat detection across our customers  entire environment  This architecture includes our new software based security solutions Cyber Vision and our Edge Intelligence data collection tool to enable our customers to make better business decisions Finally  applications  There is no question that customers are undergoing a significant workplace transformation and they are turning to Cisco to help them with this transition  As a global market leader  we believe we re the only company providing a cognitive  highly secure  and analytics driven collaboration platform  which is the foundation for their workplace transformation  This platform is becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises empower their teams by allowing their employees to work more effectively together  To extend our value proposition  we continue to make strategic investments  For example  we recently brought to market several key WebEx capabilities which combine context  AI  and machine learning to enable our customers and their teams to further enhance their meeting experiences  We achieved another strong quarter of growth with AppDynamics demonstrating our ability to deliver unique real time AI powered insights from a single pane of glass providing complete visibility  Our customers are looking to connect application performance monitoring with infrastructure automation to simplify IT and increase productivity  Two weeks ago  we announced we are bringing together AppDynamics and our Intersight Workload Optimizer to deliver comprehensive visibility of applications and infrastructure both on prem and in the cloud using machine learning and AI to proactively remediate problems and optimize user experiences To summarize  I am pleased with our business transformation and with the new innovative platforms we re bringing to market  While we continue to experience some pause in customer spending related to the uncertainty in the global macro environment  our long term growth opportunities remain unchanged  Going forward  we will continue to focus on developing groundbreaking technologies and building a new Internet for the 5G era that will help our customers innovate faster than ever before  I remain incredibly confident that our execution against our strategy will drive profitable growth and generate strong shareholder returns for the long term  I will now turn it over to Kelly Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Chuck  I ll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q3  Our overall Q2 results were consistent with our expectations  We executed well with strong margins and EPS growth  Total revenue was down  12 billion    was at  12 billion  down 4   Our non GAAP operating margin rate was 33 7   up 1 6 points  Non GAAP net income was  3 3 billion  flat year over year  and non GAAP EPS was  0 77  up 5  Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue  Total product revenue was down 6  to  8 7 billion  Infrastructure platforms was down 8   Switching revenue declined in both campus and data center  We did see growth with the continued ramp of our Cat 9000  Phonetic  and strength of the Nexus 9000  Phonetic   Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider  Wireless declined overall  but we did see strong growth in Meraki and are starting to see the ramp of our WiFi 6 products  Data center revenue declined driven by servers offset by strong growth in HyperFlex  Applications was down 8  driven by a decline in Unified Communications  partially offset by double digit growth in AppDynamics  Security was 9  with strong performance in identity and access  advanced threat  and unified threat management  Service revenue was up 5  driven by software and solutions support We continued to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions  Software subscriptions were 72  of total software revenue  up 7 points year over year  In terms of orders in Q2  total product orders were down 6   Looking at our geographies  the Americas was down 8   EMEA was down 1   and APJC was down 4   Total emerging markets were down 7  with the BRICS plus Mexico down 20   Phonetic   In our customer segments  public sector was flat while enterprise was down 7   Commercial was down 4  and service provider was down 11   Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q2 were  24 9 billion  up 11   From a non GAAP profitability perspective  total Q2 gross margin was 66 4   up 2 3 points  Product gross margin was 65 9   up 3 1 points and service gross margin was 67 7   flat year over year  In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective  Q2 net income was  2 9 billion and EPS was  0 68  We ended Q2 with total cash  cash equivalents and investments of  27 1 billion  operating cash flow was  3 8 billion  flat year over year  From a capital allocation perspective  we returned  2 4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of  0 9 billion of share repurchases and  1 5 billion for our quarterly dividend  Today  we announced a  0 01 increase to the quarterly dividend to  0 36 per share  up 3  year over year  This represents a yield of approximately 2 9  based on today s closing price  This dividend increase reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows  We continued to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline  In early Q3  we closed our acquisition of Exablaze  a designer and manufacturer of advanced network devices aimed at reducing latency and improving network performance To summarize  we executed well with strong margins and EPS growth  We re seeing the returns on the investments we re making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long term growth and shareholder value  Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal  20  This guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier  We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 1 5  to minus 3 5  year over year  We anticipate the non GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64 5  to 65 5   the non GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32 5  to 33 5  and the non GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20   Non GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from  0 79 to  0 81  Our guidance does not reflect any potential disruptions in our global supply chain that could result from the coronavirus  We will continue to monitor the situation closely  I ll now turn it back to Marilyn  so we can move into Q A Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Kelly  Michelle  let s go ahead and open the line for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  Tim Long from Barclays  You may go ahead Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystThank you  Yeah  Chuck  maybe if I could just start talking about the macro and the kind of the lower decision process  Your sense  how long do you think this would last  particularly if you maybe put into the context of you mentioned a lot of industry drivers going on 400 gig and WiFi 6 and obviously  you got some new router and silicon products out  So maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of that recovery and how you think you could maybe outperform it given all the different dynamics you have going across the businesses this year  Thank you Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Tim  thanks  it s a great question  So I think first of all  there are many secular growth drivers that are lined up  you know  the 5G transition  the 400 gig transition  Wi Fi 6  the shift to cloud and what we re seeing from customers is really just  it s just pausing just trying to see what s going on  Now what I will say is that clearly late in the quarter  if you look at some of the issues that had been outstanding that were creating some of the uncertainty like Brexit  we get closer to resolution  We obviously got a signature late in the quarter on a first phase of the U S  China trade deal and USMCA has now gone through in the U S  So hopefully those will give our customers a little more viability  When I speak to the customers  they are still fully planning on moving forward  They are just a little cautious in trying to see what s going on  We obviously have the virus now but we ll see how it plays out  but overall  I don t think it s deep and we expect that given some of this uncertainty has now dissipated notwithstanding what we see obviously from the virus that hopefully we ll see our customers pick up again Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystOkay  thank you Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Tim  Next question please OperatorTejas Venkatesh from UBS  You may go ahead Tejas Venkatesh    UBS    AnalystThank you  I had a big picture question  With the December routing announcements and the Cat 9000  Phonetic  before that  a lot of the Cisco strategy is now around selling incremental automation software to lower customer opex  That seems to require a significant change in your organization  So how far along are you in the sales and channel transformation to fit that goal  Thank you Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a very good question  thank you  We have done a lot of work on the transformation of being able to support the software model and the subscription software model in particular with the automation and we have  if you go back to 2017 when we first launched the Catalyst 9000 and we announced subscription businesses on our enterprise networking portfolio  the second half of this year we ll have some    a number of    a small amount of the early renewals on that  So our team has been working hard to be prepared for those renewals and then in fiscal  21  we ll see a material number    reasonably material number associated with that  So I think the sales organization  we ve run pilots and now we ve scaled things  we re running other pilots and we re scaling things and we ve got the customer experience organization that Maria Martinez is leading that has been building out their capabilities  So we have more to do  but I feel good about the progress we ve made and I think that we re in a pretty good position right now Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorSimon Leopold from Raymond James  You may go ahead Simon Leopold    Raymond James    AnalystThank you very much  I m wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the service provider vertical given it s been a long running challenge and it seems as if maybe to some extent it s less of a focus for Cisco given that it s such    become a smaller part of your business  but want to see if you can maybe talk about how you see this market eventually recovering  kind of the timing and the drivers  maybe double clicking beyond just sort of the 5G hand waving  if we could get a better understanding of what will drive it and when  Thank you Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean it s a lot better just to wave hands  Let me tell you a little bit  I don t think that it s a market that we are ignoring  In fact  if you look at the announcements we made in December    let me give you a little update on that  We have about five years of R D effort in what we announced in December  So that s a lot of commitment to the market  So we do believe that there will be a resurgence  I think that    I will talk about 5G and 400 gig as well  but just to give an update  in December as you know  we launched Silicon One  which is at the heart of these new systems called Cisco 8000 that we launched and we also announced that we would be willing to sell our silicon to go into a white box or sell it just directly to a customer if that s how they like to procure it  I will tell you that across the cloud titans  they are    we re engaged with all of them on variations of those architectures  Several of them were with us at the announcement in December  which shows you their belief in what we re doing  We have taken orders for both from different cloud players and so we feel good about the acceptance of that launch  The 8000 series will be a fundamental backbone product for 5G networks and I will tell you that we have early wins on IP infrastructure to support 5G roll outs in over 30 customers around the world  They re early  Some of those are cell site aggregation  backhaul  some core wins  Most of them are in non stand alone which means they re enhancing their current networks and then they ll look to build stand alone networks  As we ve said  we believe that will start in 2021 where we could begin to see some of that pick up  So we think the 400 gig transition as well as the 5G build out will be the drivers that we d be looking for over the next couple of years Simon Leopold    Raymond James    AnalystThank you Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Chuck  Next question please OperatorThank you  Paul Silverstein from Cowen   Company  You may go ahead  Paul Silverstein  your line is open Paul Silverstein    Cowen   Company    AnalystSorry  I m still learning how to use the cellphone  Kelly  your margin structure was particularly strong this quarter and that represents a long trend both near term and longer term  I recognize the guidance represents an easing  I assumed some of that is due to the backup in DRAM pricing and the pending back up  Can you go back through the drivers and what you expect over the next year or two both at the gross and the operating level Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  happy to  And yeah  no  we re really happy about where the both gross margins and op margins are  but as you know  Paul  it is driven by a few things  This software transformation has been benefiting us through both  you know  you can see it in the mix of our products when we show you the gross margin walks in our Qs as well as just overall  So we re benefiting from that  I d say the second big driver is price  We ve been very  very disciplined on price  meaning we re taking advantage of    raising prices where we have elasticity  for example  on really older products that we want to shift to newer products or where we know we have room to move  we ve been doing that I think very effectively  We ve been managing the decline in the pricing in the server market fairly well balancing that with the DRAM prices that are going down dramatically  So what you re going to see in the reporting this quarter  Paul  and I know you always ask  you ll see our pricing    you know I mentioned on the last quarter s call that pricing was at an all time lowest level of impact  meaning the most beneficial it s been  We re right back at a 1 1 points on our year over year gross margin walk  So it s still very  very good for us and more in line of what it was I d say a couple of quarters before Q1  So that s going well DRAM is benefiting us this quarter for sure and as you know  that s becoming less and less of a benefit to us now as we re starting to see the DRAM prices tick back up  but we ve again managed for that pricing and DRAM cost equation very well  So just in general  I think you can expect a little bit more pressure from DRAM pricing  the year over year compare is getting less which is why I guided what I guided  but overall  you re still going to see the goodness coming through from the continued increase of our business being software driven Paul Silverstein    Cowen   Company    AnalystKelly  if I could just quickly follow up  Looking beyond the quarter  looking beyond April  given the ongoing shift to software  is there any reason why margin shouldn t  Phonetic  continue to head up putting aside quarterly volatility Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI mean again  I would say  yes because what we re doing on the portfolio is more and more software content  So by definition  it will be good for us  We will always have the potential for large swings for things like component costs like DRAM plus or minus  but as always  we ll let you know when those are happening  but yeah  I mean if you go back and look three years back from where we were there to where we are now  it is long term just the shift of the overall portfolio that we ve been driving Paul Silverstein    Cowen   Company    AnalystI appreciate it  Thank you Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorJim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research  You may go ahead  sir Jim Suva    Citigroup Investment Research    AnalystThank you very much for the clarity so far and I have one question that s kind of more broad  I don t know if it s for which of you  but on product orders  I was just kind of looking and thinking about the product orders  it looks like the enterprise product orders got incrementally a little more challenged  public sector got a little more challenged  service provider marginally improved compared to last quarter year over year  Can you maybe give us some color on product orders  it looks like maybe enterprise was a difficult year over year comps  Was it last year a big product cycle in enterprise or why are we actually seeing enterprise kind of decline incrementally a little bit worse  Thank you Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  hey  Jim good question and let me take a crack at it  So when I look at the segments  if I focus on enterprise  a lot of it is the Q2  19 really  really strong product cycle ramps we had  So if I go back to Q2  19  it was a record for the campus switching for us as well as for collaboration back in Q2  19  No excuse  but that s what that was  I would say beyond that  if I would isolate overall kind of our regions from a bookings point of view  the Americas was down 8  and if I look at that  the U S  itself was slightly better  but in that range and I d say it was driven by two areas  it was driven by the routing portfolio largely SP segment  that was the biggest driver and the second biggest driver was the decline we re seeing in the server market and again that s directly related to the decline of DRAM prices flowing through the entire market and we saw that last quarter as well  So that drove the Americas  Europe was at minus 1   basically flat  but that the biggest driver when I look at Europe was really the U K   we are seeing a slowdown because of Brexit and we did see it in the public sector significantly  which is always a big growth driver for the U K  for us  So U K  both enterprise and public sector slowed down for us  which drove Europe  Europe would have been up 2 points without the U K  and then for APJC  it continues to be the rapid decline of China  China is as I ve talked about in the BRICS plus Mexico being down  China was down again over 30   It s still only about 2  of our total business  but it still hurts the overall  I mean  Asia Pac excluding China  would have been up a couple of points as well  3 points  So from a geography  those are the key drivers and again  to your point  we are going up against some tough compares in enterprise for both the campus 9000 ramp a year ago and collab just had a record quarter Jim Suva    Citigroup Investment Research    AnalystThank you  That was a great explanation and greatly appreciate it  Thank you so much Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jim Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Jim  Next question please OperatorIttai Kidron from Oppenheimer   Company  You may go ahead  sir Ittai Kidron    Oppenheimer   Company    AnalystThanks  Chuck  I wanted to dig into applications  down 8  on a year over year basis and I understand the pressure on the Unified Communication business and it s good to see App D  Phonetic  is still growing  but you haven t talked WebEx  Am I to assume that WebEx is not growing or stuck in the middle here  Help me think about the transformation Amy has been doing over there  where we are in that transformation and how should I think about the growth and competitiveness of that platform going forward Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the    first of all  they have rearchitected all those platforms  integrated the back ends  and have a very modern set of solutions to take to market and we re currently working out    I was talking to the team yesterday  I think there is 11 workshops with major customers in the next 30 days to work on plans to get them to the the modern portfolio because some customers have been running variations of the stuff that we ve had out there for 10 years to 15 years  So we re in good shape  In fact  there was a great analyst report that was written just a couple of days ago about   industry analyst about the portfolio and how far it s come and how effective it is right now  So  I feel good about what they re doing  I think if you look back a year ago flat out  collab was up 24   I mean and it s a huge business to be up that much  So they had a very tough year to compare against  but I m pleased where they are  There is competition  Obviously  there is some good competition in this space  which frankly should just keep making us better  but the team is doing  I think  a really good job  Kelly  you want to comment on   Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI mean  I ll just give you the    you know  I d say the largest driver was the UC business in the revenue being down  the huge majority followed by a bit on the endpoints on the TP and conferencing was down marginally  hardly anything  but the biggest driver was for sure on the Unified Communication side Ittai Kidron    Oppenheimer   Company    AnalystVery good  All right  Good luck  guys Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorThank you  Jeff Kvaal from Nomura  You may go ahead Jeff Kvaal    Nomura    AnalystYes  thank you very much for taking the question  I was hoping that you could unpack a sort of a bit of a bigger down tick maybe in IP than we were expecting balanced by a better performance on the services line  Can you sort of help us understand what the dynamics are and some of that may be accounting for where the software goes  I d love to understand that a little bit better  please Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would say  I talk about this    on the service increase  there has been no change on the accounting side for how we account for software  Service improvement    you know  we ve been really driving that  Maria Martinez  you know  that leads CX for us  customer experience  has been really focused on driving renewal rates and adoption and you ve seen our services business from a revenue perspective tick up over the last four quarters  So I d say that 5  growth you saw in services is just continued performance by that team to do that  I d say on the infrastructure platform side  it does go back to again just very  very    we were peak    not peak  but we are very  very high ramping of campus switching last year  So that s a tougher compare  I mean it s still growing like crazy  but that s a big driver  Routing is still down driven by the SP segment and then in terms of the last piece from a year ago again  we talked about and we saw that applications was up 24  again  which is all collab basically a year ago as well  So it s nothing more than those things I would say combined with the data center server market is    we are starting to feel that  you can see what s happening in the market there Jeff Kvaal    Nomura    AnalystDoes that imply  Kelly  does that 5  services growth rate is a durable number or should we be thinking it will fluctuate between that and the sort of low single digits growth that we ve seen Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  we re certainly trying to make that a sustainable kind of range  We have no desire to have that slow down  but again it s    the team is doing everything they can  They are offering new solutions  not just    you know  they re trying to find more ways to drive incremental growth versus just being tied to the maintenance to the product orders and they re driving much more solutions along software and everything else  So they are working a lot of plays in the services area Jeff Kvaal    Nomura    AnalystObviously they are  Congratulations  Thank you Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorRod Hall from Goldman Sachs  You may go ahead  sir Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  thanks for fitting me in  I just had a quick question trying to juxtapose the guidance with the order rates  If you look at those total product orders  the rate    they re down 6  after down 4   So that deteriorated and yet your revenue guidance for the midpoint at least your revenue decline is a little better than the quarter you just printed  So you printed down 3 5  and the guide is down 2 5   So kind of tailing on Jeff s question there  is the services making that up and what should we be expecting for product revenue in the guided quarter and then I also I m hoping Chuck maybe you ll make a comment on this whole 5G investment commentary coming out of the press and maybe the government  what do you think of that  How interested in Cisco in potentially helping deploy U S  wireless infrastructure  not the stuff you do today  but actual base stations and things like that  Can you just comment on how you see some of those    that commentary  how you think that might develop Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I could go first  Yeah  your question is a good question  Rod  but I would say  really where we ended up at the minus 6  was not a surprise  That s kind of when I gave guidance for the Q2 kind of what the expectation was  I would say  as you know when we roll up the guide as we go for Q3  we just  it s the same process that we know exactly what s coming off the balance sheet  we have a    we know exactly what s in backlog  we know exactly what we expect for orders coming in and it s just pure math  I think again back to a lot of the decline in the order rate was there s a bit of compares  but the rest when you do the math and add it all up to what you expect to come through for the next quarter  it gives you the number I guided in the midpoint  If you look at that  it s very consistent with what our normal Q3 to Q2 sequentials are Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Kelly Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then  Rod  on the question around the 5G discussions in Washington  I mean obviously  they are very interested in having U S  companies participate in 5G and frankly lead in 5G and so we have spent a lot of time educating different folks in Washington about what technologies actually constitute an entire 5G network  So you rightly said  not the stuff we have  but the radio  which is pretty much what we don t have  but I think the U S  is in really good shape  I think we have packet core  we ve got cell site and radio backhaul  we got the IP routing core  we got security  and we have obviously there is a couple of companies in Europe  one in South Korea that provide the radio technology  there s also software players that are out there right now that are building disaggregated OpenRAN solutions that can be used in the future  And so we re spending a lot of time helping them understand that and working to just make sure that there is a recognition that there is a lot of technology that s been built and being built here in the United States that is leading in these 5G infrastructures  and I actually think the U S  is in fine shape I think both from a carrier deployment perspective  I think we re in great shape and I think we re in good position with the technology  I don t think the U S  government should make investments in these companies  but we are certainly working with lots of industry peers  again on both education and then trying to just make sure that the U S  does have solutions with combining these European players with a lot of our technologies to make sure that everyone s comfortable with those solutions Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThat s great  Thanks  Chuck Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Chuck  Next question please OperatorSami Badri from Credit Suisse  You may go ahead Sami Badri    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  I would like to ask about the SP orders that were down 11  in the quarter and looking forward to the back half of this year  and any kind of forward looking indicator  trajectory  commentary would be helpful  If you look at two scenarios  one scenario assuming a recent telecom consolidation  right  that we ve all heard about in the last two days and then in a scenario where no consolidation actually happens for the rest of the year  Should we expect service provider orders to inflect positively in one of those scenarios or in both of those scenarios as we look at the back half and maybe kind of mid to back half of 2020 Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat s a tough question to answer  We ve been dealing with challenges in this segment for a long time  I think    and history would tell you that when we see consolidation  it creates a slowing  I m not sure that this particular one represents that because I think they are going to be in investment mode and it is triggering investment with other players as well and I think the 5G build out that all of them are working on will probably fuel investment  I think for us it just depends on how quickly they do that and how soon they decide to build a stand alone 5G network for enterprises  I think most of them are looking at their consumer networks and believing they can accommodate them on their existing backbones with perhaps some minor upgrades  but I think that will determine it  So I think it s more connected to how fast they move on that than it has to do with any of the consolidation or no consolidation right now Sami Badri    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  Thank you Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorSamik Chatterjee from JP Morgan  You may go ahead Samik Chatterjee    JP Morgan    AnalystHi  thanks for taking the question  I just wanted to see if we can drill down a bit more on the Cat 9000 product portfolio  You mentioned already a couple of times on the call that the product momentum    the revenue momentum there is quite strong  I was just wondering if you can kind of talk about the impact on the growth rate that you ve kind of seen directionally through this kind of broader landscape of slowing enterprise spending and if the growth rate there is kind of still substantially different from what you re seeing for the rest of the portfolio  Do you think it s more a reflection of the subscription kind of model that you re going with on that portfolio or more kind of the refresh that s driving that difference and kind of what you re seeing related to the rest of the portfolio Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I ll just say the growth rate of the Cat 9000 is unbelievable still  I mean it is a very high double digit number  I would say there is no    we haven t heard issues  I d say for maybe some of the smaller disties  there is a question about the subscription  but we ve managed through that  but I would say those    the new products from the 9200 through the 9600  that isn t slowing and the growth rates are very  very strong  Obviously  the legacy products that they have replaced are falling off as you would expect  but we have not seen any slowing on the transition  it s the fast and again we mentioned this in the early ramp of the Cat 9000  but at this point the percentage of what the Cat 9000 is of total campus switching is the fastest ramp of any transition we ve done Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd if you look at the    what Kelly talked about earlier with WiFi 6 beginning to ramp  That s a subscription model  Our Meraki business is a subscription model  which is still growing very well  So I don t think the subscription model has anything to do with it  I just think in certain cases some of our larger customers who are watching some of the things going on just decided to just take a pause and take a look at what s happening and then I think they ll kick back in Samik Chatterjee    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  thank you Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsGreat  Next question please OperatorThank you  Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities  You may go ahead  sir Tal Liani    Bank of America Securities    AnalystYes  hi  I want to ask you a broader question and I ll call it secular versus cyclical  Switching had a small cycle    short cycle with a new switch  there was growth acceleration  Now  we see a decline overall in switching and there s probably substitution between new and old and routing is also declining and the question I m asking is off the trends you see today  you know  data center switching  campus switching  routing  the service providers  what is cyclical and what is secular meaning when are we going to see a reversal  not when in terms of timing  what s going to drive I should say    what s going to drive a reversal of the trends in routing    what could drive  What could drive a reversal in data centers and campuses  what are the things that could drive at least a cyclical growth from here or even secular growth kind of longer term  Thanks Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo Tal  it s a great question  I think in the routing space is simply it s to 5G backbone build out that we ve been talking about for a few years  Once that starts I think given the percentage of our routing business that is attributed to service providers  I think that s the key  as well as us winning these Cisco 8000 assertions that we have proof of concepts going on today with many of the large customers both service provider and web scale players  So I think that s that one  And I think on the campus side  I just think that s just a timing issue  I think that the growth we re seeing in the Catalyst 9000 is tremendous and I think that customers that began to build out their refresh given where we are as a percentage of the installed base that we have replaced  it s got a long road ahead of it  I think that the only reason that we saw a little slowdown is just because customers just decided to pause their deployments a bit  but I think that will come back when this uncertainty and the capital spending frees up Tal Liani    Bank of America Securities    AnalystIn routing Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRouting I answered first with the SP with the 5G backbone stuff because of how big a percentage service provider represents in our routing portfolio Tal Liani    Bank of America Securities    AnalystGot it  Okay  thank you Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Tal  Next question please OperatorMeta Marshall from Morgan Stanley  You may go ahead Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks  With subscriptions being 72  of software revenue  what you stated  I wondered if you kind of had an update as to how much of a headwind that kind of business model transition is  In the past you had kind of said a couple of hundred basis points  but just any    directionally  if that s still about right would be helpful  Thanks Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean  again I think back a few years ago before we adopted the new revenue standards  it was a bigger impact  It was up to like 250 basis points or 300 basis points  but with ASC 606  it s come back down to that 100 basis points  but at this point  you know  we don t even talk about it that way because we ve been ramping so quickly the entire portfolio to that but at max it would be  I d say 100 bps or so Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsWe have time for one more question  Michelle  tee us up for one more OperatorThank you  Jim Fish from Piper Sandler  You may go ahead  sir Jim Fish    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for squeezing me in  One part that we haven t talked about here today is on the security side  We have RSA coming up at the end of the month  So just wondering if we could double click on where we are with Duo and Umbrella together as it seems like they are the biggest drivers of the business  Can you guys talk a little bit more about the contribution of these two specifically to the portfolio and how Umbrella specifically is impacting your adoption of secure SD WAN versus some of the other vendors that are out there  Thanks Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  so I ll give you the sort of the qualitative answer and Kelly can give you something on the data  but I think the secure SD WAN is the solution our customers are looking for  I mean they want the integration with their cloud gateways from their branches and so it is a key differentiator for us  Our teams are working hard on continuing to build that out and I think over the next couple of years  it will continue    it will be even more of a differentiator as we continue to get more and more integration between those two portfolios  Kelly Kelly A  Kramer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  no  I d say that s absolutely right and in terms of how important Umbrella and Duo are  they absolutely are the key growth drivers for us  the whole cloud security space for us and will continue to be so and I d say we recently launched our Secure Internet Gateway  which is just starting and that will be all part of our cloud security portfolio as well and we expect that to be a huge growth driver as well Jim Fish    Piper Sandler    AnalystGot it  Thanks Chuck Robbins    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  All right  Well  let me just thank everyone for joining us today and I ll just recap by saying that while we have seen a bit of a pause  we actually feel really good  The conversations I have with our customers  I mean all of the things they are trying to do I believe our technology is at the heart of whether it s rebuilding their applications  whether it s securing their data  transforming their infrastructure in this new era or changing their user experience as well as the way they interface with their customers  I think that we re in a very good position to help them do that and we feel good about where we are  So thank you all for joining us today and we ll look forward to catching up with you next quarter Marilyn Mora    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Chuck  Just to wrap the call  Cisco s next quarterly earnings conference call  which will reflect our fiscal 2020 third quarter results will be on Wednesday  May 13th  2020 at 1 30 PM

215561,437077,CSCO,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday  12th February,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    Bernie Sanders wins the New Hampshire primary  leaving former front runner Joe Biden needing a miracle in Nevada and South Carolina to keep his nomination hopes alive  Markets are rallying again on another drop in reported new cases of the Covid 19 virus  but changes to China s counting methodology have further undermined trust in the reliability of its data  Earnings season revs up again with updates from CVS  Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Shopify and Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   while   Lyft    NASDAQ LYFT  disappointed investors with its update late on Tuesday  And OPEC is due to update its forecasts for global oil demand after the U S  government cuts its forecasts due to the virus  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  12th February 
1  Creative counting casts doubt on virus tally
The Covid 19 coronavirus  as it s now officially known  is mutating   not biologically  but statistically  Chinese authorities announced a second big daily drop in the rate of new infections Tuesday  but reports from outside China suggest that that may be due more to changes in China s way of counting 
As of late last week  China is no longer counting those who test positive for the virus as infected as long as they show no symptoms of the disease  Given that Chinese studies acknowledge that patients can go for up 24 days without showing symptoms  that creates a clear risk of undercounting 
Outside China  the number of cases on a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama  Japan  rose to over 170  while Singapore s financial district was rocked when DBS Group  the island state s largest bank  sent workers home after discovering a case among its workforce  The Chinese Formula 1 Grand Prix was cancelled  while a major shipbuilder announced force majeure on its conracts  saying that labor shortages would stop it delivering two large bulk carriers on time 
2  New Hampshire
Senator Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic primary  but strong showings by Pete Buttigeig and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar means that the race for the nomination is still very much an open one 
Former vice president Joe Biden again trailed badly in fifth place  as he had done in Iowa  His hopes of the nomination now depend heavily on his performance in Nevada and South Carolina  which will show if he can still count on his traditional support among minorities 
3  Stocks set to march higher
U S  stock markets are set to open higher again  bolstered by the improving official Chinese data and by the awareness that central banks are unlikely to withdraw any of the liquidity provided in recent weeks to soothe markets during the Covid 19 outbreak 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that barring  persistent  and  material  impacts on the U S  economy  the Fed s current monetary policy stance would remain appropriate for the near future  That means at least two more months of repos and bill purchases  he added 
By 6 30 AM ET  1130 GMT   the Dow 30 futures contract was up 131 points  or 0 5   while the S P 500 contract was up 0 4  and the Nasdaq 100 contract was up 0 5  
European stocks also hit new highs overnight  the benchmark Stoxx 600 rising 0 5  on the back of solid earnings from luxury giant   Kering    PA PRTP  and Dutch brewer Heineken  among others 
4  Earnings season revs up again with tech  financial reports  Lyft s update disappoints 
After a relatively quiet start to the week  earnings season gets back into full swing  with updates from CVS before the open and Cisco after the close 
CME Group  Shopify  Equinix and Moody s also are due to report 
 Lyft   NASDAQ LYFT  will also be in focus in early trade after the company chose not to follow Uber  NYSE UBER  in moving up the date when it expects to be profitable  The company s revenue growth slowed to 2 5  in the second half of last year from 6  in the first half  while its net loss widened  The outlook and the quarterly numbers together combined to push the stock down 5 5  in after hours trading 
One of Uber s largest investors  Softbank  also reported overnight  Its reported profit fell 99  after its Vision Fund posted a  2 billion loss  caused largely by writedowns of its investments in WeWork  Softbank stock had soared by 12  on Tuesday after a U S  court cleared the plans of another big portfolio company  Sprint Corp   to merge with T Mobile US  NASDAQ TMUS  
5  OPEC to estimate virus hit to global oil demand
The U S  government cut its forecast for global oil demand this year by 300 000 barrels a day due to the Covid 19 outbreak  a step that sets the stage for similar actions by OPEC and the International Energy Agency as they release their monthly reports over the next couple of days 
OPEC is due to update its latest estimates for global supply and demand in its monthly report today  while the IEA s report is due to follow on Thursday 
The short term drop in demand was in evidence on Tuesday  when the American Petroleum Institute reported a 6 million barrel increase in U S  crude inventories last week  That s more than twice the increase predicted for the official government inventory count that is due at 10 30 AM ET  GMT 
Crude prices continue to recover gradually after a brutal sell off  however  By 6 25 AM ET  U S  crude futures were up 1 6  at  50 73 a barrel  while Brent futures were up 2 2  at  55 19 ",2020-02-13,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-12th-february-2082666,2082666
215562,437078,CSCO,Stocks   U S  Futures Point Higher as Virus Fears Ease,news,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing com   U S  stocks are set to open higher Wednesday  continuing the recent positive trend as investors take heart from signs the coronavirus outbreak might be peaking  
At 7 30 AM ET  1230 GMT   futures for theS P 500 traded 12 points  or 0 4   higher  futures for the Nasdaq were up 49 points  or 0 5   while the Dow Jones futures contract rose 125 points  or 0 4   
The death toll from China s coronavirus  officially called Covid 19  now exceeds 1100  but there have been signs the outbreak may be peaking at the epicenter of the crisis  
Authorities in Hubei  the province where the outbreak likely originated  said there were an additional 1 638 confirmed cases of the virus Wednesday  That is almost one third less than the previous day s new cases  However  reports from outside China suggest that this may be due more to changes in China s way of counting  China s National Health Commission said last week that it would no longer count new cases as confirmed until patients started showing symptoms of the disease  China s own studies suggest that people can remain asymptomatic for up to 24 days after catching the virus 
Both the S P and Nasdaq again closed at record high levels Tuesday  posting gains in six of the last seven trading sessions and having their best months since June  
The large cap tech companies  which have been behind a lot of the recent gains  will be in focus Wednesday following the announcement of a regulatory probe into previous deals by these firms  The move raised fears over a more aggressive regulatory crackdown on big tech 
Boeing  NYSE BA  is also expected to be in the spotlight after the aircraft maker reported late Tuesday that it received no new orders for commercial jets in January  By contrast  its major rival Airbus  PA AIR  received 274 orders 
Elsewhere  the U S  earnings season may be coming to an end  but there are still some well known names reporting  
Shares in   Lyft    NASDAQ LYFT  traded over 4  lower after hours despite reporting late Tuesday more than  1 billion in quarterly revenue  However  the ride hailing company didn t move up its estimates for making a profit  a disappointment in the light of Uber s hopes of becoming profitable at an underlying level by the end of this year 
Shares in Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  slumped 25  after announcing late Tuesday that same store sales declined in December and January  The company  whose stock is heavily shorted  said it was facing inventory challenges and issues attracting customers to its stores 
CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts  forecasts and revenue that topped expectations  These numbers may have impressed  but investors in CVS  as well as other stocks tied to healthcare  will be keeping an eye on developments in the Democratic primaries  This is especially with respect to Sen  Bernie Sanders  who won in New Hampshire on Tuesday and is running on a platform of single payer health care 
Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  reports quarterly results after the bell Wednesday  The networking giant is expected to report a profit of 76 cents per share on revenue of about  12 billion  according to analysts  forecasts compiled by Investing com

Cisco reports after market close
Networking hardware giant Cisco is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter results this afternoon after the market closes  The stock rose in anticipation  up 1 1  in the morning 
Cisco set the bar low when it issued its guidance as part of its first quarter report in November  The company expects revenue to drop by 3  to 5  year over year in the second quarter  ending a two year streak of growth 
Cisco s customer base is sensitive to economic uncertainty  The trade war between the U S  and China  as well as general angst about the global economy  has led some customers to delay orders  Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said during the earnings call that they re seeing  a bit of a pause  from some customers  with some deals pushed back and others downsized 
This is nothing new for Cisco  The last period of weak sales lasted about two years  ending in the second quarter of 2018  Cisco has ramped up its software business and its recurring revenue streams since then  so this cycle may not be quite as bad 
Cisco expects to report non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share between  0 75 and  0 77 in the second quarter  up from  0 73 in the prior year period  The per share earnings growth will be driven by share buybacks  Cisco spent nearly  22 billion buying back its own shares in fiscal 2019 
Whether Cisco stock rises or falls following the report will likely depend on the company s guidance  If Cisco can sell the idea that this downturn won t be as bad as the last one  that could be enough good news to propel the stock higher  If guidance is weak  the stock could come under some pressure 
Disney raises ticket prices
All eyes have been on Disney s rapidly growing Disney  streaming service  which is taking on incumbent Netflix with a vast catalog of high quality content  But it was Disney s parks that were in the news on Wednesday 
Disney is raising admission prices at its Disneyland resort in California  A single peak day ticket will now set you back  154  up from a previous price of  149  Prices for annual passes were also hiked  The pricey Premier Passport now goes for  2 199  up 13  from one year ago  according to Bloomberg  Disney stock was up 0 6  Wednesday morning 
Disney s parks  experiences  and products segment generated  26 2 billion of revenue in fiscal 2019  up 6   Higher guest spending was the main growth driver  The company opened its Star Wars  Galaxy s Edge attraction at its Florida and California parks last year  which led to increased costs for the parks business 
Disney has shown that it can continue to raise prices without deterring would be guests from visiting its parks  There is a limit to Disney s pricing power  though  If the company takes the price hikes too far  attendance could suffer ",2020-02-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pub9m,2083160

215594,437110,CSCO,Why Cisco Is Overdue for a Reemergence,news,"As the overall market trades near record highs  companies like Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  seem to lag  Cisco stock has risen by just under 250  since the March 2009 lows  This does not compare well to the S P 500  which increased by over 375  over the same period  Tech giants such as Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  have seen more dramatic growth 
These lower returns might make investors wonder why they would want to buy Cisco stock  However  with its latest 5G and software technology  Cisco could finally make a long awaited comeback 
The rise and fall of Cisco
Cisco stock was a darling of the dot com boom in the late 1990s  So dramatic was its surge that it briefly overtook Microsoft as the company with the world s largest market cap in March 2000 

However  the stock would go on to lose more than 90  of its value by September 2002  The company survived and rebranded itself  It even joined the Dow in 2009  Today  Cisco stock appears to fit the stereotype of a Dow Jones stock  Profit growth remains mired in the single digits  Also  the one time tech darling that once eschewed dividends now has increased its payout every year since it was introduced in 2011  However  Cisco stock still sells for about 40  less than it did at its peak almost 20 years ago 
Will it rise again 
In a sense  Cisco has already risen again  This networking company  previously known for hardware  now derives a significant percentage of its revenue on the software and services side  Products such as Silicon One  Exablaze  and its white box solution should help to drive revenue growth  This growth should particularly accelerate with wider 5G adoption  As more consumers and businesses utilize artificial intelligence  virtual reality  the Internet of Things  and other technologies  Cisco technology will play a significant role in supporting this connectivity 
Moreover  its financials remain strong  Since bottoming out at below  10 per share in 2002  adjusted earnings per share has risen more than sevenfold  Despite this growth  investors can now buy Cisco at a much lower cost than during the height of the dot com bubble  The company which once supported a P E ratio of more than 200 today trades at a more modest multiple of 19 4 
Cisco poised for long term gains
Investors should not anticipate Cisco stock returning to a 200 plus P E ratio  However  with the stock trading below 20 times earnings  a 5G led revival could drive multiple expansion 
Admittedly  for that to happen  earnings will have to return to double digit growth rates  The company has not seen those levels of increases for several years  Profits grew at an average of 7 76  per year during the previous five years  For the next five years  Wall Street predicts that that average will fall to 6 99  per year  Competition from the likes of Juniper  Arista  Huawei  and others will make larger earnings increases more difficult to attain  Unless the company can produce more substantial profit growth  sustained multiple expansion is unlikely 
Still  even if profit growth does not come as quickly as expected  investors need to take note of the dividend  At the current stock price of about  48 per share  Cisco stock yields about 2 9   Still  given payout hikes of the last eight years  another increase will probably happen this year  Barring major disruptions  annual payout hikes will probably continue for the foreseeable future  
Cisco s outlook continues to improve
In the latter part of 2019  Cisco suffered through a rough patch  In its August earnings report  the company announced that revenue growth would likely come in flat to up just 2  for the upcoming quarter  The stock dropped by close to 20  over the summer as concerns about slowing sales weighed on the sector 
However  conditions have turned out better than some had feared  Management predicted revenue growth accurately  reporting 2  growth at the upper end of its range in the most recent quarter  
Also  the trade picture has improved dramatically  Since the U S  signed the phase one trade agreement with China  both countries have a greater degree of uncertainty on trade  The Asia Pacific  Japan  and China  APJC  region accounted for 15 2  of sales in 2019  China makes up a relatively small percentage of those sales  Still  with sales in China having fallen 31  in the previous quarter  a deal should offer welcome relief  With China trade no longer hampering growth  both revenues and Cisco stock itself can move higher 
Now is the time to buy Cisco
Both 5G and software will help propel Cisco higher  Cisco built its reputation as an internet hardware company in the 1990s  However  in today s market  hardware has become a commodity that generates little in profit  Cisco pivoted more toward software years ago  and with wider 5G adoption coming soon  it could finally share in some of the spoils enjoyed by other tech giants 
Cisco could face some difficulties  The competition will present challenges as the company struggles to return to double digit earnings growth  However  with the move into 5G  and a rising dividend that pays investors to wait  Cisco stock could shoot higher as preparation meets opportunity ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnxzt,2069481

215608,437124,CSCO,Better Buy  Arista Networks vs  Cisco,news,"According to Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   global network traffic is poised to grow 26  annually by 2022  Beyond their short term challenges  both highly profitable network vendors Cisco and Arista Networks  NYSE ANET  should benefit from this tailwind  But should investors prefer Cisco s dominant position over Arista s stronger revenue growth  Let s take a closer look and see which is the better buy 
Cisco  the historical dominant network vendor
Cisco  founded in 1984  initially sold routers  which are devices that forward network traffic between networks  It then expanded its portfolio with switches    network devices that connect computers and servers into the same physical network    following its acquisition of Crescendo in 1993  And after many other acquisitions  Cisco now offers computer based solutions that span over a large spectrum of networking areas  including security and communications 
As a result  Cisco became a dominating network vendor  Synergy Research Group estimates Cisco s revenue from its routers and switches represented 51  of the market during the last quarter of 2018  
The company s revenue increased from  46 1 billion in fiscal 2012 to  52 0 billion over the last 12 months  It also generated a solid operating margin of 27 8   thanks to its research and development and sales and marketing costs that are spread over its large revenue base 
However  Cisco struggled to adapt its legacy portfolio to the disruptive cloud computing technology  In contrast with Cisco s proprietary and monolithic solutions  cloud titans such as Amazon with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft with Azure utilize flexible  cost efficient  and high speed solutions to run and grow their huge data centers  Therefore  Cisco s share in the high speed data center switching market dropped from 78 1  in 2018 to 46 6  during the first half of 2019  according to Crehan Research 
But Cisco made a U turn to address its challenges in the cloud network data center area  Last month  it announced a new network operating system  IOS XR7  and a silicon architecture  Silicon One  that cloud titans and third parties can use to build their own network devices  
Thus  despite its expected next quarter revenue decline in a range of 3  to 5  because of a weak macro economic environment  according to management  Cisco should profit from the increase in global networking traffic over the long term 

Arista  the fast growing challenger
Arista filled the gap Cisco left with its lack of suitable networking solutions for cloud titans  As a result  Arista grew its revenue from  193 4 million in 2012 to  2 45 billion over the last 12 months  And during the last quarter  its revenue increased by 16 2  compared to last year 
Logically  its share in the high speed data center switching market increased from 3 5  in 2012 to 18 8  during the first half of 2019  As the company serves huge cloud providers  which demands fewer sales and marketing efforts compared to acquiring many small customers  its sales and marketing expenses dropped below 10  of revenue since the second half of 2017  In contrast  many growth tech companies spend about half of their revenue as sales and marketing expenses  
Thus  Arista s operating margin of 33 7  over the last 12 months remains impressive in the context of its high revenue growth 
But Arista also has its challenges  With its concentrated huge customers  Microsoft and Facebook should each represent more than 10  of Arista s revenue in 2019   the company is exposed to the volatility of their expenses  For instance  during the last quarter  Arista communicated disastrous guidance that forecasts its next quarter revenue to decline by 8  year over year  Management justified this disappointing outlook because of the shift in the procurement strategy of one single customer 
Beyond this short term difficulty  Arista s dependence on a few customers should diminish  The company started expanding its portfolio in 2018 with its entry into the campus market  smaller corporate networks   but this decision will also intensify the competition with other network vendors such as Cisco and Juniper Networks 
Cisco is a better buy for prudent investors
Besides their short term challenges  both tech stocks should profit from the increase in global traffic over the next several years  Thanks to its smaller scale and its greater exposure to the cloud network data center market  Arista should keep on growing at a faster pace than Cisco 
Arista s higher price to sales ratio of 6 5 and forward P E ratio of 22 9 compared to Cisco s respective ratios of 3 86 and 13 98 reflect this expectation 
But given Cisco s solid dominant position and its capacity to adapt    with some delay    to cloud computing  its modest valuation seems a better choice for prudent investors  Arista s potential remains important  but the company depends on solid execution to keep on delivering strong growth over the long term and justify its higher valuation ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph0xq,2057579

though the experience of the last 18 months doesn t give a lot of cause for comfort   AMP s Oliver said  However  weaker Chinese and U S  economies as well as the U S  presidential election next year

Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the U S  economy facing a dramatic bust is remote  A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a U S  recession

lows hit on Thursday  But it is down 8 bps on the week  set for the biggest weekly fall since mid August  Dutch 10 year bond yields are down 7 bps this week  and French yields are 5 bps lower   Data on Thursday had showed Germany s economy grew just 0 1  in the third quarter  with consumer spending helping the country to avoid a mild contraction and a technical recession of two quarters of economic shrinkage   In general  there has been risk aversion in recent days and a shift to core bond markets from the periphery   said Daniel Lenz  a rates strategist at DZ Bank  Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the United States and China aimed at ending their 16 month long trade war   China s commerce ministry said the two countries are holding  in depth  discussions on the first phase trade pact  and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal  China has also ended a nearly five year ban on imports of U S  poultry meat  which the U S  Trade Representative said would lead to more than  1 billion in annual shipments to China  Those developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs  only to have U S  President Donald Trump deny that any such deal had been agreed to  The new record for the S P  which gained just 0 08

215637,437153,CSCO,Asian shares rise  but gains capped by weak sentiment,news,"By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI  Reuters    Asian equities rose on Friday after the S P 500 index notched a new record closing high  but investor sentiment remained fragile following weak data from China and Germany  which reinforced concerns about the global economy 
Early in the Asian trading day  MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0 34   Japan s Nikkei added 0 58  and Australian shares gained 0 53  
The safe haven yen weakened  with the dollar rising 0 11  to buy 108 50 yen  The euro was unchanged at  1 1021 and the dollar index  which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals was flat at 98 163 
Providing a fillip to investor confidence in Asia were comments from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that Washington was getting close to a trade agreement with China 
Higher U S  Treasury yields also indicated a slight risk on tone in the Asian session  with the 10 year yield rising to 1 8307  from a US close of 1 815  on Thursday 
The policy sensitive two year yield rose to 1 6036  from 1 593  on Thursday after U S  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the U S  economy facing a dramatic bust is remote 
A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a U S  recession  few see an economic rebound  and most believe a trade truce is unlikely in the coming year 
Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the United States and China aimed at ending their 16 month long trade war 
On Thursday  China s commerce ministry said that the two countries are holding  in depth  discussions on a first phase trade agreement  and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal 
China has also ended a nearly five year ban on imports of U S  poultry meat  which the U S  Trade Representative said would lead to more than  1 billion in annual shipments to China 
Those developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs  only to have U S  President Donald Trump deny that any such deal had been agreed to 
The new record for the S P  which gained just 0 08  to 3 096 63  came despite a grim outlook from network gear maker Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  that underlined the impact of trade uncertainty 
The company forecast second quarter revenue and profit below expectations as increasingly global economic uncertainties kept clients away from spending more on its routers and switches  sending its shares down 7 3  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0 01  27 781 96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0 04  to 8 479 02 
European shares also fell after data showed the German economy grew just 0 1  in the third quarter  with consumer spending helping the country to avoid a mild contraction 
 In further diminishing the likelihood of significant fiscal stimulus from the Berlin government  it was not good news at all   analysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note

215649,437165,CSCO,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com    Here s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivers remarks on U S  economic outlook before the Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday at 11 00 AM ET  16 00 GMT  
The Fed s chairman s speech comes just two weeks after the U S  central bank cut its key rate for a third time this year  And the Fed signaled it would hold rates steady for the remainder of the year 
Powell told reporters at his post meeting news conference on Oct  30 that the current stance of monetary policy was  likely to remain appropriate   as long as there was no material change in the central bank s outlook on the economy 
Fresh guidance on monetary policy  however  may likely be limited as Powell is  unlikely to have materially altered his thinking since the statement and press conference   Nomura said in note to clients 
Ahead of Powell s testimony  President Donald Trump again criticized the Fed  At his appearance before the New York Economic Club  the president charged the central bank s previous round of rate hikes had put the economy at a disadvantage and that he longed for negative interest rates

Shares of the company fell 6 2  to  22 71 in after hours trading 
 We remain in a very challenging macroeconomic environment  which has certainly worsened recently and has impacted our guidance for the third quarter   Chief Executive Officer Matthew Murphy said on a conference call with analysts 
 There s clearly a pause and the slowdown going on is driven by a lot of effects  
Murphy highlighted challenges to business from Huawei and certain large customers  noting that the switch to 5G cellular communications from 4G had cut demand for chips 
Marvell said it stopped shipments to Huawei  one of its key customers  in the first quarter  following the U S  ban on the phone maker  The U S  government blacklisted Huawei in May  alleging the Chinese company was involved in activities contrary to U S  national security or foreign policy interests 
Kinngai Chan  an analyst with Summit Insights Group  noted that weaker demand from Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  also hurt business

 Reuters    Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  said on Wednesday that impending U S  tariffs and Chinese customers shunning the networking company s gear were weighing on its business  and it forecast sales and profit below Wall Street targets 
Cisco executives said sales in China fell 25  and that the country s state owned enterprises were no longer taking bids from Cisco 
 We re not being allowed to even participate anymore   Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins told investors on a conference call 
Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said in an interview that Chinese companies were dropping Cisco gear and instead buying hardware from domestic Chinese companies 
 There s a certain sense of nationalism   Kramer said 
Cisco estimated first quarter revenue growth of 0  to 2   This implies a range of  13 07 billion to  13 33 billion  while analysts expect  13 40 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
It estimated adjusted earnings of 80 cents to 82 cents per share in the first quarter of 2020  below analysts  forecast of 83 cents 
Shares of Cisco  a Dow component  fell 3 4  in the runup to results amid broader declines in the market  and dropped 8  to  46 53 in after hours trading 
While sales to China fell sharply  they comprised less than 3  of overall sales in Cisco s fiscal fourth quarter  Slower orders from large businesses  especially in the United Kingdom  also contributed to the below expectations forecast 
Cisco said U S  tariffs on Chinese made goods would soon hit its products  dragging down margins in its fiscal first quarter  U S  President Donald Trump said this week he would delay a 10  tariff on some Chinese made goods until December  But Kramer said most of Cisco s goods were not part of the temporary reprieve and face tariffs next month 
 Nothing got excluded so far   Kramer said 
That would weigh on the company s margins in its fiscal first quarter  she added  Cisco forecast adjusted gross margins of 63  to 64   virtually unchanged from the 62 9  in the just reported quarter 
Since taking the helm in July 2015  CEO Robbins has emphasized growth areas such as the cloud  Internet of Things and cybersecurity through acquisitions

215682,437198,CSCO,Cisco whistleblower gets first False Claims payout over cybersecurity,news,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Cisco Systems  O CSCO  Inc has agreed to settle a whistleblower s claim that it improperly sold video surveillance software with known vulnerabilities to U S  federal and state governments  marking the first payout on a False Claims Act case brought over failure to meet cybersecurity standards 
The settlement and underlying claim were unsealed on Wednesday  eight years after the initial legal complaint  Cisco paid  8 6 million to resolve the case  with most of that going to the federal government and 15 state buyers and more than  1 million going to the whistleblower  James Glenn 
 We are pleased to have resolved a 2011 dispute involving the architecture of a video security technology product   said Cisco spokeswoman Robyn Blum   There was no allegation or evidence that any unauthorized access to customers  video occurred as a result of the architecture  
Glenn attorney Anne Hayes Hartman and other experts believe Cisco s payout is the first in a false claims cyber case 
Many more whistleblower claims could ensue  experts said  The settlement  clearly provides an opportunity for entrepreneurial plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs to go around looking for more examples like this   said Georgetown University law professor Gregory Klass 
Hundreds of false claim suits are filed yearly  in part because of built in rewards for those who point out improper conduct by government contractors  Under the law  a whistleblower must provide nonpublic information in order to win an award 
With many contracts including pledges that products meet cyber security standards set by the government  experts have long warned that the claims could expand into that area and punish vendors for the vulnerabilities that are present in many systems 
Cisco s Video Surveillance Manager was used by Los Angeles International Airport  the Washington D C  police and the New York City public transit system  as well as many schools  said Hartman 
The complaint unsealed Wednesday also names as customers the U S  Army  Navy  Air Force  and Marine Corps 
Glenn was working at a Cisco partner in Denmark called NetDesign  the complaint says  among other things working with Danish police  In 2008  he warned Cisco that a hacker who got into one camera that was part of the system could use flaws in the software to get administrative control of the entire network  The suit says a hacker could then potentially move beyond the video system 
 Due to the vulnerability in Cisco s surveillance system  any user who has or can gain access to one video camera could potentially gain unauthorized access to the entire network of a federal agency   the suit says 
When Cisco failed to act  Glenn spoke with an L A  airport police detective on an FBI terrorism task force 
The company acknowledged the flaws in 2013 as it released an updated version of the software 
 There s this culture that tends to prioritize profit and reputation over doing what s right   Glenn said in a written statement   I hope coming forward with my experience causes others in the tech community to think about their ethical mandate  ",2019-07-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cisco-whistleblower-gets-first-false-claims-payout-over-cybersecurity-1941617,1941617

215702,437218,CSCO,Hungary has no evidence of Huawei threat  plans rapid 5G rollout  minister,news,"By Gergely Szakacs
BUDAPEST  Reuters    Hungary has no evidence that equipment from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei poses a security threat  a government minister said on Thursday  adding that Budapest was mulling incentives to accelerate the rollout of a high speed 5G network 
The United States and some of its Western allies believe Huawei Technologies  equipment could be used for espionage  and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the European market  Huawei denies the accusations 
Washington is concerned in particular about the expansion of Huawei  the world s biggest maker of telecoms equipment  in Hungary and Poland 
Budapest has so far shrugged off the security concerns and on Thursday Innovation and Technology Minister Laszlo Palkovics told Reuters that Hungary had yet to receive any evidence beyond what he called accusations leveled at Huawei 
 We have taken a rather pragmatic stance  the same  in fact  as Germany   Palkovics said   It has not been proven that Huawei s technology would pose any risk to Hungary  as we have seen no  data  to support that  
 Until it is proven that Huawei  or Cisco or any other technology poses any threat to our community  that is Hungary  NATO or the European Union  we will handle Huawei s technology as any other technology   he added 
Palkovics  comments follow the Hungarian telecoms regulator NMHH s publication this week of the draft documentation for the sale of more than 400 megahertz of 5G spectrum later this year  This fires the starting gun on the rollout of a high speed wireless network expected to serve self driving cars and real time communication between machines 
He said the country expected the auction to raise about 70 billion forints   244 67 million  
Huawei employs around 2 000 people in Hungary  where it has invested  1 2 billion since 2005 according to company figures  Its European Supply Centre near Budapest  launched in 2009  is Huawei s biggest production base outside China  the group says 
Prime Minister Viktor Orban s government has strengthened business ties with Beijing over the past years 
FAST ROLLOUT
Acknowledging that Hungary s technological acumen lagged that of its U S  and German allies  Palkovics said Budapest was studying the example of Germany where he said an assessment system was developed to precisely identify possible security threats  Germany is Hungary s biggest foreign investor 
 I am positive  that if it were to become obvious that  there is a security risk   Hungary is a member of NATO  which entails a spate of commitments  which we will follow  but so far  there has been no information to support that   he said 
Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  unit Magyar Telekom has installed Huawei and Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  equipment at a 5G test base in western Hungary 
Asked whether Huawei could participate without restrictions in the rollout of Hungary s 5G network  Palkovics said 
 Once other  technologically more advanced countries launch the rollout that way  we will follow suit  If they do not  we will not either  
Palkovics said the government was planning talks with telecoms companies and other players in the sector on ways to facilitate a faster rollout of 5G 
The minister said he had met representatives of Germany s Siemens and car maker BMW  which plans to build a 1 billion euro factory in eastern Hungary  for talks on possible uses of 5G technology 
 In Germany  Siemens and BMW have proposed that there should be an available spectrum for in house applications  These companies are also present in Hungary and they have proposed the same   he said  adding that these frequencies would be allotted in a second stage of the Hungarian 5G tender ",2019-06-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/hungary-has-no-evidence-of-huawei-threat-plans-rapid-5g-rollout-minister-1903346,1903346

215717,437233,CSCO,Britain to allow Huawei restricted access to 5G network,news,"By Michael Holden and Jack Stubbs GLASGOW  Scotland  Reuters    Britain will allow Huawei Technologies a restricted role in building parts of its 5G network  seeking a middle way in a bitter dispute between the United States and China over the next generation of communications technology   Huawei  the world s biggest producer of telecoms equipment  is under intense scrutiny after the United States told allies not to use its technology because of fears it could be a vehicle for Chinese spying  Huawei has categorically denied this  Britain s National Security Council  chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May  met to discuss Huawei on Tuesday  Britain will block Huawei from all core parts of the 5G network and access to non core parts would be restricted  two security sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity    It s essential that we get the balance right  ensuring that our networks are built in a way that is secure against interference from whatever source  but also are competitive   said Britain s finance minister  Philip Hammond  The Daily Telegraph newspaper first reported the decision  5G  which will offer much faster data speeds and become the foundation stone of many industries and networks  is seen as one of the biggest innovations since the birth of the internet itself a generation ago  In what some have compared to the Cold War arms race  the United States is worried 5G dominance would give a competitor such as China an advantage Washington is not ready to accept  European nations are treading a fine line in the dispute between the world s two most powerful countries  under pressure from the United States to take a hard line on Huawei but also anxious not to sour trading and diplomatic relations with China  Huawei welcomed London s move  though ministers cautioned that a final decision may not have been made  FIVE EYES  Britain s compromise could provide a template for other Western nations to follow as they try to navigate the row between Beijing and Washington   The world s leading intelligence sharing network   the anglophone Five Eyes alliance of the United States  Britain  Australia  Canada and New Zealand   will not use technology from Huawei in its most sensitive networks  a U S  official said   What I see playing out here is a discussion amongst all of us about the realities of where do you define sensitive networks  where does that start and end   said Rob Joyce  a senior official from the U S  National Security Agency  For Britain s spy masters  the riddle of Huawei is only a part of the wider challenge of securing 5G networks and what they see as the much more fundamental threat from China s dominance in certain globalized technologies of the future  Ciaran Martin  head of the cyber center of Britain s main eavesdropping agency  GCHQ  played down any threat of a rift in the Five Eyes alliance and said any decision on Huawei had to take into account Britain s international trading posture  When asked if the United States was softening on Huawei  he said   I wouldn t get into language like softening    I welcome the debate is beginning to inch into wider territory about general standards of security required for 5G to protect us and our allies from any attack   said Martin  head of the National Cyber Security Centre  NCSC   Huawei  founded in 1987 by a former engineer in China s People s Liberation Army  denies it is spying for Beijing  says it complies with the law and that the United States is trying to smear it because Western companies are falling behind  THREAT  Huawei s equipment is either not present or is being stripped out of existing core networks in Britain  but is widely used in lower risk parts such as radio masts  The telecoms equipment market is dominated by three suppliers   Huawei  Sweden s Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Finland s Nokia  HE NOKIA    and network operators oppose any move that would limit competition among them   Companies such as Samsung  KS 005930    Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  and China s ZTE  HK 0763  are also targeting parts of the 5G equipment sector   The world s second largest mobile company   Vodafone   LON VOD   has warned a complete ban would significantly extend the cost and time to deploy 5G   What Britain is trying to do is keep Huawei s technology away from the brain of the network  while using it in the less sensitive parts of the nervous system   But lawmaker Tom Tugendhat  the chairman of Britain s Foreign Affairs Committee  said allowing Huawei to remain in the 5G network would undermine trust between Five Eye allies   Our most important security alliance is the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network   Tugendhat said   The problem with therefore having Huawei running our infrastructure is that it undermines that trust   Tugendhat said it was difficult to define core and non core with 5G and that the Chinese company should not be allowed to build Britain s 5G network  One of the biggest changes between 4G and 5G is the ability to take the advanced computing power usually kept in the protected  core  of a network and distribute it to other parts of the system   This will provide more reliable high speed connections  But it also means engineers will no longer be able to clearly ring fence the most sensitive parts of the system  U S  officials say  Chris Watson  head of the technology  media and communications group at law firm CMS  said it was not clear how 5G technology would develop  and more data processing could move to the network edge  blurring the line between the core and periphery  
 It s not yet clear quite what 5G networks are going to consist of  and therefore where the real processing power and communications links are going to be located   he said ",2019-04-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/uk-to-block-huawei-from-core-parts-of-5g-network-source-1843914,1843914

215748,437264,CSCO,Huawei s Rapid Growth  Alleged Theft Helped Sow Mistrust in U S ,news," Bloomberg     Huawei Technologies Co  wanted a better way to test its telephone handsets  so it sent an engineer to see  Tappy   the robot in partner company T Mobile US Inc  s laboratory in Bellevue  Washington 
 Tappy   computer driven and tireless  taps on touch screens  simulating weeks of use in a day  The Huawei engineer was curious about Tappy s fingertips  So he slipped one into a laptop bag and left with it  in an act T Mobile branded theft 
The 2013 incident  described in a lawsuit filed the next year by T Mobile  is the sort of alleged behavior by China s top telecommunications equipment maker that has alarmed security experts  Now some are warning against the use of Huawei gear in the next generation 5G network being assembled to connect factories  vehicles  homes  utility grids and more 
 They ve surpassed everyone else  and the way they ve done that is through copycat technology and ruthlessly stealing intellectual property from Western companies   said Jeff Ferry  an economist with Coalition for a Prosperous America  an advocacy group close to the Trump administration and its China hawks 
Representatives of Huawei s Chinese headquarters referred calls to Chase Skinner  a San Francisco based Huawei spokesman  who declined to comment  Huawei has regularly denied that it steals intellectual property or unfairly copies technology from other companies  It said this week that blacklisting its equipment without proof will hurt the industry and disrupt the development of new high speed technology 
But Huawei s conduct is drawing renewed scrutiny after the Dec  1 arrest in Vancouver of Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on allegations she defrauded banks to violate Iranian sanctions  The daughter of Huawei s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei  she now faces extradition to the U S  in a case that s sparked a diplomatic row 
Meng s arrest follows a long string of allegations by the U S  government about a potential threat to network security  The U S  has pushed European governments to avoid Huawei s gear  saying it s an enabler for Chinese espionage  which the company has always denied 
In 2012  the House Intelligence Committee published a report that described Huawei as  a company that has not followed United States legal obligations or international standards of business behavior   The committee called on the U S  intelligence community to  remain vigilant   and said national security officials must block acquisitions involving Huawei or fellow Chinese gear maker ZTE Corp  HK 0763  
Years earlier  Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  Corp  sued to stop Huawei from selling data traffic switches and routers allegedly based on Cisco s patents and copyrights  The litigation ended with Huawei agreeing to stop selling disputed products in 2003 
In 2010  the company failed to reach agreements to buy U S  software and wireless gear makers  reportedly because the sellers doubted the company would win approval  In 2008  Huawei and Bain Capital Partners LLC abandoned a bid for gear maker 3Com Corp  after failing to assuage security concerns raised by U S  officials 
The Tappy caper involved a machine that used its mechanical arm to repeatedly poke and prod phone screens  in imitation of a human user  helping T Mobile to improve the reliability of its handsets  Huawei wanted to know the size of the finger and the material out of which the conductive tip was made  T Mobile told a federal court in Seattle 
The Huawei engineer  left alone in the lab  first slipped the fingertip behind a computer monitor then three hours later tucked it into his bag  T Mobile told the court 
 There is some truth to the complaint   Huawei spokesman William Plummer said at the time  He blamed  employees acting inappropriately in their zeal    Another worker had furtively taken photos of Tappy  according to T Mobile  
T Mobile dropped Huawei as a supplier and in 2017 a jury awarded the American company  4 8 million in damages for breach of contract but rejected allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets  The two sides later agreed to drop the case after settlement talks  Michael Kipling  an attorney in the case for T Mobile  declined to comment and attorney Bo Yue  for Huawei  didn t respond to a request for comment 
The largest U S  mobile providers  after urging by U S  officials  have shunned Huawei network gear  and small providers are concerned they may be forced to rip out and replace Huawei products as the Federal Communications Commission moves against Huawei 
U S  intelligence and law enforcement agencies harbor a deep suspicion of Huawei  exacerbated by its ties to China s People Liberation Army  said James Lewis  director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic   International Studies in Washington 
 Deep connections with the PLA  industrial espionage  and subsidies from the Chinese government    there you have it   Lewis said in an interview 
Customer Trust
A company executive reiterated this week that it abides by international law  and challenged its accusers to produce evidence of their claims about security risks 
 Despite the efforts to create fear about Huawei and to use politics to interfere with industry growth  we re proud to say that our customers continue to trust us   Ken Hu  one of several Huawei rotating chairmen  told reporters during a press event at its manufacturing base in Dongguan  the company s largest campus worldwide 
Hu slammed U S  accusations about Huawei s independence and alleged role in espionage 
 Lots of countries have various concerns on 5G  Most of these concerns are reasonable and based on technology   Hu said   With regard to such concerns  we ll work with governments and operators to clear them up  
The company also released a diary entry it said Meng wrote  which described an outpouring of support from around the world  It was entitled  There Is Always Good in People   and explained how a letter writer from Japan said she was  very sad  for Meng s arrest in Canada and  cannot keep silent any longer  
Ren  Huawei s founder  joined the People Liberation Army s engineering corps in 1974 and rose to become a deputy director  but without military rank  according to a biography by the company  Ren established Huawei in 1987  now the company reports annual sales of about 600 billion yuan  or  93 billion 
House Report
The 2012 House report noted that the ruling Chinese Communist Party maintains a committee within Huawei  and said the company failed to explain its relation to the government  Huawei has said the government plays no role in its business decisions or staffing 
But the company is working against hardened sentiment in the Trump administration  Lewis said   The government in general has decided that the Chinese will never stop misbehaving unless we push back   Lewis said 
Meng s case exists alongside a shadow cast by Huawei s reputation  said Paul Triolo  who leads global technology studies at the Eurasia Group consultancy and who regards the matters as linked 
 It s definitely connected to the broad concerns about Huawei and its central role in 5G   Triolo said   The fear of the U S  and its allies is that a 5G network built by Huawei represents a risk  a security risk  
Vulnerability is heightened because 5G systems will rely on software that can be penetrated to a greater extent than 4G networks  and because so many machine to machine connections will rely on 5G  raising the stakes for a disruption or espionage  Triolo said 
In Europe  carriers and major customers from Orange SA  PA ORAN  to BT Group  LON BT  Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn  have voiced their concerns about Huawei s gear  on top of existing bans in Australia  New Zealand and the U S 
The U S  Embassy in Germany said allies and partners are being urged to be vigilant in ensuring network security  including when carriers award equipment contracts

 Reuters    TIBCO Software Inc  a large privately held business software provider  is acquiring French data management company Orchestra Networks in a move that will bolster its ability to help clients organize customer data  according to sources familiar with the matter 
The deal  which could be announced as soon as Tuesday  values Orchestra in the low hundreds of millions of dollars  the sources added 
TIBCO declined to comment and Orchestra could not be reached for comment 
Palo Alto  California based TIBCO was taken private by software focused buyout firm Vista Equity Partners in 2014 for  4 3 billion 
Founded in 2000 in Paris and owned mostly by its founders  Orchestra Networks  primary product  EBX  allows customers to manage and share a wide array of data assets and comply with regulations  The two companies have some large banking customers in common  one of the sources said 
The General Data Protection Regulation brought in by the European Union in May to protect personal information in the internet age has led to global corporations spending more on tightening data controls and using software to help 
The deal will allow TIBCO to add a new feature to its software platform  which it calls its Connected Intelligence Cloud  TIBCO sells software to enterprises that help them integrate disparate data sets  manage application programing interfaces and analyze data

215775,437291,CSCO,Digital media company Technicolor explores options including sale  sources,news,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Liana B  Baker
LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    Technicolor SA has been exploring options that include a full or partial sale of the French digital media company  as its set top box business struggles because of higher prices for memory chips  people familiar with the matter said on Friday 
A deal would represent the biggest shakeup for the company  based in Issy les Moulineaux  since it agreed in March to sell its profitable patent licensing business to U S  wireless technology provider InterDigital Inc for  475 million 
Technicolor has been in discussions in recent months with other companies and private equity firms  including Bain Capital  about a sale of the company or a merger with a peer  the sources said 
Technicolor has also been exploring a sale of just its set top box division  which it calls connected home  the sources said  One of the sources said the company received non binding offers for that unit earlier this month 
Connected home accounted for 1 billion euros   1 14 billion  of Technicolor s total revenue of 1 77 billion euros in the first half of 2018 
The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential 
Technicolor  which trades on France s Euronext and has a market value of 503 million euros  declined to comment  Bain Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Technicolor operates two main divisions  entertainment services and connected home  The entertainment services business helps provide the visual effects seen in movies and commercials  as well as Blu ray and DVD manufacturing 
In 2015  Technicolor acquired Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  Inc s set top box business  a  600 million deal intended to boost its presence in the home entertainment market and expand its North American footprint 
But the bet soured as higher input costs weigh on Technicolor s set top box business  Passing these costs on appears difficult given the strong bargaining power of its larger customers and competition in the equipment sector  credit ratings agency Moody s Investors Service Inc said in a note earlier this year 
Technicolor s adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from continuing operations fell 30 percent year on year in the six months to the end of July to 57 million euros ",2018-11-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/digital-media-company-technicolor-explores-options-including-sale-sources-1691998,1691998

215816,437332,CSCO,Uber investor Lead Edge Capital closes  520 million fund,news,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Venture firm Lead Edge Capital  which has backed companies such as Uber  UBER UL  and Spotify  has raised its largest fund to date in the latest sign of the rush of capital flowing into private tech companies 
New York City based Lead Edge Capital said on Thursday it has closed a  520 million fund to invest in software and internet startups  The new fund size is an 80 percent step up from its previous fund of  290 million and is 10 times larger than its first fund  a  52 million pot in 2011 
The firm s growing fund size is consistent with the broader trend in the venture industry of firms raising ever larger funds and fundraising more quickly  as startups also raise ever larger funding rounds and stay private longer  relying on venture capitalists and other private investors rather than the public stock markets for funding 
 Stuff is more expensive today than it was five years ago   said Mitchell Green  the firm s founder and managing partner   There is a lot of money chasing too few deals  
Increasingly  venture firms are competing against big mutual funds  sovereign wealth funds and SoftBank Group Corp s Vision Fund  a nearly  100 billion investment vehicle  to invest in the hottest tech companies  The competition requires they have more cash available 
Lead Edge previously invested in ecommerce and internet giant  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding  food delivery service Delivery Hero and cybersecurity company Duo Security  which was acquired by Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  for  2 35 billion  Uber Technologies Inc is its highest profile investment that remains a standalone  private company 
Lead Edge was also an early investor in Bird  the controversial Southern California scooter company valued at  2 billion 
The Bird investment aside  Lead Edge tends to invest in later stage companies that generally have at least  20 million in revenue  the firm s partners said in an interview  Its strategy means it avoids the youngest and riskiest startups  so fewer of its investments go bust  but because Lead Edge invests when companies are more valuable  its returns can be lower than other venture capital firms  the partners said 
The new fund brings Lead Edge s total capital under management to  1 5 billion  About 70 percent of the firm s fund comes from wealthy individuals who include technology executives  entrepreneurs and dealmakers ",2018-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/uber-investor-lead-edge-capital-closes-520-million-fund-1584371,1584371

215818,437334,CSCO,Kudlow Says U S  Willing to Talk With China as Tariffs Loom,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump is willing to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as the two nations square off over trade  but Beijing needs to show it s open to compromise  said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow 
Kudlow declined to say if the Trump administration will clarify Friday whether it will follow through with a plan to impose tariffs on  200 billion in Chinese goods  the day after a public feedback period ended   We will evaluate the comments and we will make a decision  in terms of the volume  tariff rate and timing  he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV 
While China s response to U S  demands has been unsatisfactory  Trump is still speaking to Xi  and would be open to meeting in person  said Kudlow  director of the White House s National Economic Council  An opportunity could take place when world leaders gather at the UN General Assembly in New York this month and the Group of 20 summit in Argentina in November  he said 
 It s never too late to make good trade policy   said Kudlow   But I will say this  the world trading system is broken   Trump is  dead serious  in his determination to push China to reform its trade policies  he added 
Trump is getting a last minute earful from prominent technology companies and retailers as he considers whether to follow through with his plan to ratchet up tariffs on Chinese exports 
 Time to Stop 
Members of the public had until Thursday to comment on the administration s plan to slap tariffs on everything from bicycles and baseball gloves to digital cameras  paving the way for Trump to announce the tariffs as early as Friday  As of Friday morning in Washington  the White House had made no announcement 
Trump  in an interview with Bloomberg News last week  showed no sign of backing down  repeating his long standing complaint that China has taken advantage of the U S  and its leaders for decades   It s time to stop  We can t let this happen   the president said 
The U S  Trade Representative s office didn t respond to a request for comment 
Tariff Plea
On Thursday  Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Hewlett Packard and other technology companies sent a letter to U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging the administration to avoid imposing more tariffs  By increasing duties on telecommunications networking gear  the administration would raise the cost of accessing the Internet and slow the roll out of next generation wireless technologies  the companies said 
Manufacturers and small and mid sized firms in particular can t quickly adjust and the tariffs imposed so far haven t led to any meaningful concessions  a coalition of the National Retail Federation and 150 organizations said in separate comments to Lighthizer  The administration should cease further tariffs actions and give another shot at talks for a trade deal with with China  it said 
 Tit for tat tariffs are counterproductive and so far have only produced increased costs for American businesses  farmers  importers  exporters and consumers    the coalition said 
The latest installment of tariffs would bring to  250 billion the total value of Chinese goods hit with duties  covering nearly half of all imports into the U S  last year  Beijing has threatened to retaliate with duties on  60 billion in American products 
China will be forced to retaliate if the U S  ignores resistance in public hearings and imposes additional tariffs  said Gao Feng  a Ministry of Commerce spokesman  at a regular briefing on Thursday in Beijing 
The trade conflict between the world s two biggest economies shows little sign of abating  roughly two months after the U S  imposed its first round of tariffs on Chinese goods  and negotiations to defuse the tensions have stalled  The International Monetary Fund has warned that a trade war could undermine the strongest global upswing in years 
Business Warnings
At public hearings last month  companies warned that fresh duties on Chinese imports could hike costs and stifle innovation  Almost 350 individuals from companies  trade associations and other entities testified  with most opposed to the levies  Many lawmakers  including from Trump s own Republican party  oppose the president s zeal for tariffs but have limited options for curbing such sanctions 
Efforts to negotiate a U S  China truce have proved fruitless  Two days of talks in Washington in August failed to yield a breakthrough following three rounds of unsuccessful talks earlier in the year  dimming hopes of a compromise 
EU  Nafta
The two nations have maintained contact on a working level since Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen visited the U S  last month  Gao said on Thursday 
U S  trade officials are juggling a number of high profile files  in addition to the China tariffs  at the same time as the president tries to tamp down reports of resistance to his agenda from within his own administration 
Lighthizer has been trying since last week to reach a deal with Canada on a revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico  and he heads to Brussels on Monday to meet with EU officials to discuss the outlines of a trade deal announced in late July 
The tariffs are intended to punish China for what the Trump administration says are unfair trading practices  including the forced transfer of intellectual property from U S  companies trying to get a foothold in the Chinese market

215824,437340,CSCO,Tech Daily  FTC Investigation  Trump Testimony  MWC  More,opinion,"The Federal Trade Commission  FTC  is investigating big tech for antitrust activity  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   is seeking Trump testimony  coronavirus impact on Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   Chinese manufacturing  companies pulling out of MWC and other stories are detailed below FTC Investigates Big TechThe FTC has asked Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Amazon  Apple  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and for the first time  Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   to furnish details  terms  scope  structure and purpose  of acquisitions going back to 2010 that were exempted  because of their small size  from antitrust scrutiny by the federal government under the Hart Scott Rodino  or HSR  Act The FTC derives authority under Section 6 b  of the FTC Act to collect non public information from companies that can then be integrated into a report and used to improve understanding of markets  boost enforcement strategies  formulate industry guidelines and best practices  and facilitate antitrust investigations FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said   If during the study we see that there are transactions that are problematic    we could go back and initiate enforcement action to deal with those transactions   He also said that  Digital technology companies are a big part of the economy and our daily lives  This initiative will enable the Commission to take a closer look at acquisitions in this important sector  and also to evaluate whether the federal agencies are getting adequate notice of transactions that might harm competition  The companies are already being investigated by the Justice Department  the FTC  state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee on concerns that their size and financial might position them to unfairly maneuver situations to either defend their market share or expand into adjacent areas And tech companies have fueled these concerns with some big deals  such as Facebook s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp  Amazon s acquisition of Whole Foods and Google s acquisition of Waze  Nest and DoubleClick  All the companies have spent more than a billion dollars in 2019 on just the kind of small acquisitions on which the FTC is seeking information Paul Holland  a general partner at Foundation Capital  said   They ve created a true marketplace for startups  They ve created a destination for them   The problem is  they ve simply become too big to control with regulations Amazon Wants Trump TestimonyAmazon s AWS lost the  10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud  or JEDI contract to Microsoft  but it vowed at the time to not take it lying down  Following up on that promise  it first filed a motion in court to delay the Department of Defense  DoD  deal until a court ruled on its challenge of the award That was followed by a discovery motion seeking to make President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper in particular and also former Defense Secretary James Mattis  Pentagon s chief information officer Dana Deasy  and the selection authority and its chairman to testify in court Amazon contends that  President Trump has unique knowledge about his involvement in the bid process  including private conversations with and instructions to others about the process and the award   Also   President Trump is the only individual who can testify about the totality of his conversations and the overall message he conveyed  AWS seeks leave to depose President Trump about conversations or other involvement he had regarding the JEDI bid process or efforts to harm Amazon or AWS  Further   President Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to use his position as President and Commander in Chief to interfere with government functions   including federal procurements   to advance his personal agenda   an AWS spokesperson said in a statement issued to Reuters  So now Amazon wants to establish in court  exactly how President Trump s order to  screw Amazon  was carried out during the decision making process   AWS has alleged zero facts    nothing    plausibly indicating any DOD official involved in the JEDI procurement  at any level  was actually influenced by the alleged anti Bezos statements   Microsoft wrote in its own statement Amazon must prove the connect between Trump s personal animosity toward its CEO and the DoD award if the lawsuit is to succeed Google Holiday Rental Service Under FireForty companies and trade bodies in nine EU countries  Switzerland and the U S  have written to EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager  urging an investigation into the way Google ranks and displays that they allege favor its own service over its competitors  Google prominently displays its product at the top of its general search results pages  along with pictures  a map review  ratings and prices  which the companies say is sufficient indication of  a competitive strategy for Google  to reduce them and the industry to  mere content providers for the  one stop shop  of Google s new product   Such favorable ranking and display secures Google s service more user attention and clicks than any competing service may acquire  even if these are more relevant for the user s search query   says the letter In Google s defense  a spokeswoman said   We re currently testing a new format for specialist searches in Europe  including jobs  local and travel  where people might see a carousel of links to direct sites across the top of the search results   and  this is designed to demonstrate the range of results available  Apple s Chinese ProductionMedia reports indicate that manufacturing at Apple s Chinese partner Foxconn is off to a slow start as spread of the coronavirus couldn t be contained as well as hoped  Chinese authorities are asking for greater protections before normal production can resume  Inflation rates are at an eight year high as supply shortages are leading to stockpiling  thus deepening the shortage  Rsearch firm TrendForce expects first quarter global smartphone production to fall by 12  to its lowest level in five years Apple supplier Foxconn is taking to steps to comply with government directives  It s also using its own production lines in the southern province of Guangdong to make masks for workers  The goal is to get to two million masks a day by late February  when the plant will work at full capacity Meanwhile  sources tell Reuters that around 16 000 people or 10  of its Zhengzhou workforce have returned to work while about 20 000 workers  or roughly 10  of the Shenzhen workforce are back from the New Year holiday  The Shenzhen workforce will return in stages Foxconn s slow return indicates the extent of the problem that the World Health Organization has declared to be a global health emergency  It s a huge disruption because Foxconn makes components for many electronics manufacturers globally so its shutdowns impact the global supply chain In Apple s case  it could not only push out iPhone sales into the next quarter but also disrupt its iPods business  as Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives says  According to him  every week of closure will push back around a million units of sales  so he expects a 3 5 million unit risk to his 44 million estimate if the disruption continues to February end  He says that iPods are already seeing supply shortages  so could be more severely impacted Tech Titans Pull Out of Barcelona MWCAmazon became the fourth company to pull out of the annual gathering on Feb  24 27  The first three to

215833,437349,CSCO,Week Ahead  Virus Risks Fuel Uncertainty  Powell Testifies To Congress,opinion,"Wall Street s resilience will be tested again as some clarity emerges on whether the Chinese containment efforts were successful in limiting the spread of the virus globally   The death toll and number of infections continue to rise in China  but optimism is growing the lockdown efforts in Hubei have prevented a broader breakout   The coronavirus economic impact to Chinese growth is unknown and if the larger manufacturers decide to keep their workers at home even longer  markets will quickly have to price in further demand destruction 

Fed Chair Powell s  testimony to Congress will focus heavily on the coronavirus  the  new risk  to the economic outlook   Congress will want further clarity on what the Fed is prepared to do and how will the coronavirus impact their current plans with the growth of the balance sheet 

On Tuesday  Democrats will get another chance at restoring voters  faith in elections   Wall Street is primarily interested in seeing if a progressive will emerge as the frontrunner for the democratic nomination   Financial markets however might not see any strong shifts with risk appetite as President Trump is still favored to get re elected 

Earnings season will also deliver critical updates from  Alibaba   NYSE BABA   Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Toshiba  T 6502  and along with several car and plane manufacturers   The latest updates on production in coronavirus impacted regions will be closely followed  The extended halting of operations could start to weigh on multi nationals

The upcoming week has a busy calendar filled with US economic data releases  Fed speakers and Treasury auctions   The US economy is strong and if growth reaccelerates and inflation picks up  we could see rate hike calls return once coronavirus concerns ease   Powell s testimony to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday will be the main event with investors also paying a close look at retail sales and consumer sentiment data on Friday 

Phase Two trade talks are should not begin until China knows how big of a downturn the coronavirus will deliver to their economy   China may push for some leniency in delivering some of the phase one purchase commitments until travel has returned to normal   The recent decision by the Chinese to halving tariff on US goods was done mainly with the hope the US will play nice until they know the overall impact the virus will have on their economy

RussiaThe Bank of Russia has rate cuts on cruise control following the sixth consecutive rate cut and could very well cut again at the next meeting   Russia is vulnerable to weakness in China and could see the ruble continue to weaken on safe haven flows to the dollar 
US Politics Following the debacle that was the Iowa Caucus  all eyes will be on Tuesday s New Hampshire primary   This is do or die time for Joe Biden and his campaign and if he has another disappointing outing that could be the end of his run for the nomination 
ChinaCoronavirus and its global spread remains the hot topic  News reports that the first person to person transfers outside of China should be causing concerns  but it hasn t  so far  With a 14 day incubation period estimated for the virus  we are approaching the deadline when we will find if the containment isolation process is a success 
So far only 2 deaths have been reported outside of mainland China  hence the bullish themes in equity markets this week  Data will likely continue to take a back seat with the Wuhan virus grabbing the headlines 

Next week s data releases include CPI data for January  a slight increase is nothing extraordinary during the Lunar New Year period   while retail sales and industrial production on Friday will suffer from the New year lockdown in some provinces 
Risk
No signs of a pause in the escalation in the spread and death toll from the Wuhan virus this week and next would hurt risk appetite  pressuring equities to the benefit of the usual safe havens of gold  the yen  Swiss franc  the US dollar and US Treasuries  It would be negative for oil and industrial metals 
Hong KongAnti government protests have really taken a back seat with the coronavirus outbreak  Surprisingly  the number of Hong Kong cases remains relatively low  21 at time of writing  but there s still the stigma of one virus related death  The Hong Kong dollar is holding up pretty well  with USD HKD still in the lower half of the permitted trading band  In the meantime  the offshore yuan has gained 0 35  versus the US dollar so far this week 
Risk
Any escalation in the coronavirus outbreak  especially given Hong Kong s  connectivity  with the Chinese mainland  though border crossings have now been cut back to two locations  would be negative for the HK33 index and could push USD HKD back to the upper half of the trading band  Carrie Lam is still under pressure to resign 
IndiaThe Indian central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at Thursday s meeting  It was the second meeting in a row the Bank stood pat after five consecutive cuts in a row during the 2018 2019 period but the central bank said the decision was not a pointer for future policy and a pickup in growth can be achieved by other means rather than monetary policy  India now has three coronavirus cases 
Risk
The Central bank acknowledged that the local economy was sluggish  which would be helped by government spending 
AustraliaRBA Governor Lowe has been moderate in recent speeches  almost suggesting he was unwilling to cut rates further  Local yields are higher this week and the Aussie has overcome disappointing data releases 
Risk
Gov Lowe expects a 0 2  hit to Q1 GDP as a result of the wildfires  If it s more  it will be negative for the Aussie  However  that GDP data will not be available until June 
New ZealandThe RBNZ is expected to hold rates at Wednesday s meeting  though given the coronavirus outbreak  we may hear comments about the preparedness scope to ease policy 
Risk
A surprise cut would hurt the kiwi 
JapanNothing of note for this week
Risk
Not really applicable   the stronger yen on the back of safe haven flows is not expected to influence the economy too much 
Market Oil After a fifth weekly decline with oil prices  OPEC   is still trying to see if they can do anything to prevent prices from collapsing any further  We were suppose to see a commitment of an additional cut of 600K  bpd  but the Russians needed more time to agree upon  it  Oil will have trouble stabilizing unless we see positive news on the virus front or if we see a significant amount of supply removed 
GoldIt seems gold prices are on the verge of ripping higher  The impact of the coronavirus on the global economy is unknown and it seems many investors may have been too optimistic 
Gold has been capped the  1 600 an ounce level  but if we see severe weakness when Asia returns to the market  we could easily prices target the  1 650 area 
Bitcoin Bitcoin is getting a steady flow of good news that seems to make it poised to break above its recent  6 400 to  10 000 range   Bitcoin is benefiting from some safe haven flows  improved progress in mainstream usage  and as the heavily anticipated halving event in May nears   While Bitcoin is not a true safe haven  cryptocurrency demand improved following the recent escalations in the Middle East   Progress on the Lightning network is also boosting hopes we could see further improvements in mainstream usage   The recent rally is a part of a broader appeal for risky assets as optimism grows the coronavirus impact might be limited to the first quarter and on optimism that China will play nice with the US on phase two trade talks

Economic News  The economy added 225K jobs in January  higher than estimates  while the Unemployment Rate rose to 3 6  

 The Labor Department s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday  showed the economy created 514 000 fewer jobs between April 2018 and March 2019 than originally estimated  This was the biggest downgrade to payrolls over a 12 month period since 2009  U S  job growth accelerated in January  with unseasonably mild temperatures boosting hiring in weather sensitive sectors  indicating the economy could continue to grow moderately despite a deepening slump in business investment    Reuters 


 U S  factory activity unexpectedly rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months amid a surge in new orders  offering hope that a prolonged slump in business investment has probably bottomed out  The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  said on Monday its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 50 9 last month  the highest level since July  from an upwardly revised 47 8 in December 


The improvement in the ISM data likely reflects ebbing trade tensions between the United States and China  Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal last month  The deal  however  left in place U S  tariffs on  360 billion of Chinese imports  about two thirds of the total  which economists say will remain a constraint on manufacturing    Reuters

215842,437358,CSCO,U S  congressional Republicans seek legislative fix to family separation crisis,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch and Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    Congressional Republicans scrambled on Tuesday to craft legislation that would quell an outcry over the Trump administration s separation of immigrant parents and children at the U S  Mexico border  with an opinion poll showing most Americans oppose the policy  The family separations and detentions of children  highlighted by videos of youngsters in cages and an audiotape of wailing children  have sparked anger at home from groups ranging from clergy to influential business leaders  as well as condemnation abroad  President Donald Trump arrived at Capitol Hill for a Tuesday evening meeting with House of Representatives Republicans to discuss their immigration legislation  He is focused on winning congressional funding for a wall he has long wanted to build along America s southern border with Mexico  a plan resisted by Democrats  Trump  who has made a tough stance on immigration a centerpiece of his presidency  has staunchly defended his administration s actions  He has cast blame for the family separations on Democrats  although his fellow Republicans control both chambers in Congress and his own administration implemented the current policy of strict adherence to immigration laws  On Tuesday  the president tried again to blame Democrats for what he called  loopholes  in the law that require families detained for entering the country illegally either to be separated or released   These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation  which we don t want   he said in remarks to the National Federation of Independent Business  adding he wanted Congress to give him the legal authority to detain and deport families together  Trump has sought to link an end to the family separations to passage of a wider bill on immigration  prompting Democrats to accuse him of using children as hostages  House Republicans were working on a revised draft of one version of an immigration overhaul that would prevent family separations in some cases for those attempting an illegal border crossing for the first time  according to a House Republican aide  The draft bill was seen just days ago as unlikely to pass  but has gained support in the House  But it was widely seen as dead on arrival in the Senate  where minority Democrats could use procedural tactics to block it and where competing but far narrower legislation may be emerging from top Republicans   CONTRARY TO AMERICAN VALUES  Two of the top U S  business groups  the U S  Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable  decried the separation policy on Tuesday and called for its immediate cessation    This practice is cruel and contrary to American values   Cisco Systems Inc  O CSCO  Chief Executive Chuck Robbins  who chairs the group s immigration committee  said in a statement   Nearly 2 000 children were separated from their parents between mid April and the end of May  The separations have been blasted by Democrats  some Republicans  medical professionals and rights activists  They began after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in April that all immigrants apprehended while crossing the U S  Mexico border illegally should be criminally prosecuted  Parents who are referred by border agents for prosecution are held in federal jails  while their children are moved into border shelter facilities under the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement  a Department of Health and Human Services agency   A Reuters Ipsos national opinion poll released on Tuesday showed fewer than one in three American adults supporting the policy  The June 16 19 poll found that 28 percent of people polled supported the policy  while 57 percent opposed it and the remaining 15 percent said they did not know  Republicans were much more supportive than Democrats  with 55 percent backing it versus just 12 percent of Democrats  but they appeared less enthusiastic about the policy than they were about the president s overall record on immigration   The images that have sparked widespread condemnation  of children in wire cages  are of a border patrol processing center in McAllen  Texas  LEGISLATIVE POSSIBILITIES A number of Republican senators called on Trump on Tuesday to allow families to stay together if they had crossed the border illegally  and Senate leaders said their chamber could have legislation to address the family separations matter in a matter of days   My hope is that this is not going to be something we re going to do over a matter of weeks and months  but something we can do in a matter of days  hopefully this week   Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed the new urgency   We hope to reach out to the Democrats and see if we can get a result  which means making a law and not just get into some kind of sparring back and forth that leads to no conclusion   he said  Top Democrats contended that Trump could change the policy with the stroke of a pen   The president is trying set this trap in the public mind that somehow there is a law requiring him to do this and Congress can undo it   said Senator Chris Van Hollen  who visited a detention center in Brownsville  Texas  over the weekend   We know this is a problem that was manufactured six weeks ago  and we re seeing the awful results today   Decrying  internment camps   Democrats and their supporters disrupted a U S  congressional hearing on Tuesday about an FBI probe  
With the sound of a young child crying in the background  the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee  Jerrold Nadler  broke from traditional protocol and started reading from a statement  saying   These  migrant  children are not animals   His Republican colleagues tried to shout over him   Out of order  ",2018-06-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-us-republicans-to-meet-amid-furor-over-immigrant-children-1498073,1498073
215843,437359,CSCO,Exclusive  Russia s telecoms security push hits snag   it needs foreign help,news,By Maria Kolomychenko and Polina Nikolskaya MOSCOW  Reuters    Russian telecoms operators will have to use foreign technology to comply with a law on storing data  two industry sources with knowledge of the matter said  even though Vladimir Putin told his government to ensure local companies produced the equipment  The law requires operators to store the content of users  phone calls and text messages for six months to aid the security services  President Putin wanted home grown technology to be used to perform the task  to boost the domestic tech industry and make telecoms systems less dependent on Western equipment   But faced with a tight deadline to start storing the vast amounts of information  and in the absence of suitable Russian hardware  operators will have no choice but to use equipment made by foreign firms including Cisco  O CSCO   Hewlett Packard Enterprise  N HPE  and Huawei  according to the sources   In having to resort to buying in hardware from abroad  Russia is encountering the same issues as other countries including the United States  the tech sector is a multinational endeavor and developing sophisticated systems using only home grown gear is fraught with difficulties   It s a good idea in theory to substitute imports  but you need to make a realistic assessment of the capacity of Russian firms   said Irina Levova of Moscow based independent think tank the Institute for the Study of the Internet   The money spent implementing this law won t stay in the Russian economy but will end up abroad   Adding to the problems besetting implementation of the law  no Russian telecoms operator has the necessary infrastructure in place  despite a July 1 deadline to start storing users  data  according to the two telecoms industry sources  One of the sources is a senior manager at a Russian telecoms operator  who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter  The other is the general director of Norsi Trans  a company that procures hardware for telecoms operators  Russia s ministry for digital development and communications did not respond to a request for comment about the use of foreign hardware or about whether telecoms firms have the necessary infrastructure in place   A spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov  responsible for telecoms  referred questions to the ministry for industry and trade  The ministry said Russian made storage equipment had been tested this year and that it would seek to help local manufacturers competing against foreign firms   There is no legal requirement for telecom operators to use Russian made hardware to comply with the data rules  which are part of package of anti terrorism legislation dubbed the Yarovaya laws after Irina Yarovaya  one of the sponsors in parliament  Of Russia s biggest operators  Rostelecom  Vimpelcom and MTS declined to comment about whether they would have to use foreign hardware to comply with the law  while Megafon and Tele2 did not respond to requests for comment  When asked whether they had the necessary infrastructure in place  Vimpelcom  Rostelecom  and Megafon said their systems were still under development  MTS and Tele2 Russia declined to comment    PUTIN S INSTRUCTION After signing the Yarovaya legislation into law in July 2016  Putin instructed his government to ensure that production of the equipment to store users  data took place within Russia   This needs to be done swiftly  We need to fill up the order books of our own firms  especially since these are good  guaranteed orders   Putin said at the time at a meeting with government ministers  A handful of Russian companies are approved by the domestic intelligence service  the FSB  to provide combined systems of software and hardware that gather and store the contents of phone calls and text messages   But the systems they are designing in most cases use foreign hardware to store the data  the two sources told Reuters   Russia just does not have the capacity to produce  in the quantities needed   the equipment for storing data  said the senior manager at a Russian telecoms operator  Sergei Ovchinnikov  general director of Norsi Trans   one of the companies selling the data gathering and storage systems to telecoms firms   also said foreign equipment was being used  Ovchinnikov said Russian made hardware for storing such massive amounts of data were still at the testing stage  He said his own company offered customers the option of using hardware from China s Huawei and other foreign firms to run home grown software   As far as I know  others producers of      the technology to lawfully gather users  data  mainly use foreign solutions   he added  The leader in the small Russian sector for supplying these combined systems is a firm called Citadel  which has a market share of about 50 percent  according to telecoms industry executives  followed by Norsi Trans with 20 30 percent   A Citadel representative declined to disclose to Reuters where the company procures its hardware  citing commercial secrecy  The company tailors solutions to the needs of each client  the representative said   Asked about deals with Russian telecoms firms  U S  company Cisco said it was  not in a position to comment on other organizations  network infrastructure    Huawei said it did not disclose commercial information about relations with its clients but it said it was looking into possible cooperation with companies producing equipment used for gathering users data under the law   U S  firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE  said company policy prevented it from commenting on contracts with customers  SECURITY CONCERNS The Yarovaya laws were written by officials in Russia s Security Council  according to four sources in the IT sector and the government  The council  which includes key ministers  sets the strategic direction for Russia s security and defense policies  The laws were written without consultation with technical specialists  according to business lobby group the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and the Institute for the Study of the Internet   The Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how the laws were written  A week after Putin signed the law  Deputy Minister of Economic Development Oleg Fomichev said there was not enough data storage equipment available  in Russia or abroad  to meet the terms of the legislation   The laws come against the background of a separate Kremlin drive to curb the use of foreign hardware and software in state digital infrastructure because it says such technology represents a cyber security risk  Last year Moscow instructed government bodies and state companies not to buy foreign telecoms hardware   Russia is not the only country to have such concerns  A hostile foreign government  counter intelligence officials say  could adapt technology at the point of manufacture  When it is sold to an overseas buyer  the hostile government acquires a  back door  into the host country s digital networks   The United States has pressured U S  companies to not sell products made by China s Huawei or ZTE  HK 0763  products  saying they potentially could be used to spy on Americans  They have also triggered concerns over Western companies such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise and SAP sharing their source code to the Russian authorities as a condition for access to the Russian market  Asked if their equipment could be exploited by foreign intelligence services  Cisco said it does not work with any government or customer to weaken its products for exploitation   Huawei said its products underwent a Russian certification process that includes testing to ensure there are no undeclared capabilities or vulnerabilities   HPE did not reply to Reuters questions on

215852,437368,CSCO,FBI warns Russians hacked hundreds of thousands of routers,news,"By Joseph Menn and Sarah N  Lynch
 Reuters    The FBI warned on Friday that Russian computer hackers had compromised hundreds of thousands of home and office routers and could collect user information or shut down network traffic 
The U S  law enforcement agency urged the owners of many brands of routers to turn them off and on again and download updates from the manufacturer to protect themselves 
The warning followed a court order Wednesday that allowed the FBI to seize a website that the hackers planned to use to give instructions to the routers  Though that cut off malicious communications  it still left the routers infected  and Friday s warning was aimed at cleaning up those machines 
Infections were detected in more than 50 countries  though the primary target for further actions was probably Ukraine  the site of many recent infections and a longtime cyberwarfare battleground 
In obtaining the court order  the Justice Department said the hackers involved were in a group called Sofacy that answered to the Russian government 
Sofacy  also known as APT28 and Fancy Bear  has been blamed for many of the most dramatic Russian hacks  including that of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 U S  presidential campaign 
Earlier  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  said the hacking campaign targeted devices from Belkin International s Linksys  MikroTik  Netgear Inc  TP Link and QNAP 
An FBI official told Reuters that the kinds of devices known to be affected by the hack were purchased by users at electronic stores or online 
However  the FBI was not ruling out the possibility that routers provided to customers by internet service companies could also be affected  the official added 
Cisco shared the technical details of its investigation with the U S  and Ukrainian governments  Western experts say Russia has conducted a series of attacks against companies in Ukraine for more than a year amid armed hostilities between the two countries  causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and at least one electricity blackout 
The Kremlin on Thursday denied the Ukrainian government s accusation that Russia was planning a cyber attack on Ukrainian state bodies and private companies ahead of the Champions League soccer final in Kiev on Saturday 
 The size and scope of the infrastructure by VPNFilter malware is significant   the FBI said  adding that it is capable of rendering peoples  routers  inoperable  
It said the malware is hard to detect  due to encryption and other tactics 
The FBI urged people to reboot their devices to temporarily disrupt the malware and help identify infected devices 

People should also consider disabling remote management settings  changing passwords and upgrading to the latest firmware ",2018-05-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/fbi-says-foreign-hackers-have-compromised-home-router-devices-1463511,1463511

CEO Chuck Robbins explained that   It feels like there is a bit of a pause  We saw things like conversion rates on our pipeline were lower than normal  which says that things didn t close the way we would have historically seen it  
Our approach to stock analysis uses market cycles to project price action  CSCO appears to be in the declining phase of its current cycle  If that is so  then the stock has broken down from the low at which it started the cycle  This is quite early in the cycle  giving it plenty of time to decline  Our target is  40 by March

215865,437381,CSCO,Cisco Systems  CSCO  Q1 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 84 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 81 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 75 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 70   A quarter ago  it was expected that this seller of routers  switches  software and services would post earnings of  0 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 83  delivering a surprise of 1 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Cisco  which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Networking industry  posted revenues of  13 16 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 64   This compares to year ago revenues of  13 07 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cisco shares have added about 11 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 23 3  
What s Next for Cisco 
While Cisco has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cisco was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 80 on  12 78 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 33 on  52 90 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

215866,437382,CSCO,Chart Of The Day  Cisco s Supply Demand Balance Suggests Weak Earnings Ahead,opinion,"Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is scheduled to release corporate results after market close today  The forecast calls for EPS of  0 81 and revenue of  13 07 billion   slightly lower than the previous quarter s  0 83 EPS and  13 43 billion revenue  but up from the same quarter last year   0 75  and flat on the revenue 
In the last 25 quarters  the company missed once on earnings   in August 2013   and three times on revenue  So  will the company maintain its record of strong earnings today  We bet against it  The supply demand balance suggests price weakness  Informed money may be trying to tell us something through the distribution of the company s shares 

The stock plunged more than 8  on Aug  15 after the company revealed that its Chinese business had plummeted 25   creating a huge falling breakaway gap that topped out the stock  Since then  the price has pulled back  found resistance by the gap  and fallen more than 9   while registering another low in the downward trend since the July high  The stock rebounded from the Oct  10 low by 7 4   more than 4  below the resistance above the gap and more than 2  from the September high  driven by demand attempting to challenge that supply line 
As things stand  the pattern that emerges since the breakaway gap in mid August is a continuation H S pattern since August  A downside breakout below the neckline s  45 level would imply a break below the long term uptrend line since 2016 and a retesting of the  40 support since March 2018  And if that level breaks  it will complete a massive H S top  implying a revisit to the 2016 lows  in the  20 area 
Volume has been drying up  as have both the short term H S continuation pattern and the long term H S top in the making  The 50 DMA crossed below the 200 DMA  triggering the much feared death cross  and the 100 DMA crossed below the 200 DMA amid the current rebound   none of which are encouraging signs 
To recap  the price is currently developing a continuation pattern since August  which  if it completes  would suggest it may fall below the long term uptrend line and target the  40 support  If this support is broken  it would imply a loss of close to 50  
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait for the completion of the massive H S top since March 2018 
Moderate traders would risk a short once the current  smaller H S completes 
Aggressive traders may short now  providing they understand and can withstand the risk

215873,437389,CSCO,Does Cisco  CSCO  Look Like A Buy Ahead Of Q1 Earnings  ,opinion,"Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   is set to report its first quarter results after market close on Wednesday  November 13  The tech giant has seen its shares rise 11 5  in 2019 thus far  lagging behind the broader computer office equipment market s over 44  run 
Cisco is coming off a fiscal year that sent the stock retreating after the company s forward guidance exacerbated worries about a potential slowdown in the tech sector  The company is looking to report a quarter that can set the tone for a strong fiscal 2020  Let s take a closer look at Cisco and what to expect from its first quarter performance 
Weak Guidance Taints Fiscal 2019 Performance 
Cisco reported fourth quarter results that beat our estimates on both the bottom and top line fronts  helping the company bolster its overall fiscal 2019 figures  The firm s Q4 metrics brought the company s full year revenue to  51 7 billion  which was up roughly 7  annually  and its adjusted EPS for the period to  3 10  up roughly 20  
Despite the encouraging top and bottom line performances from the tech giant  the forward guidance management provided for Q1 2020 sent shares lower as investors weren t satisfied with the company s expected trajectory 
The company expects sales to come in between 0  to 2  growth year over year in Q1  and its midpoint guidance for adjusted EPS of  0 81 represents Y Y growth of 8   Investors felt that the projected growth didn t justify the  4 5 billion the company spent on stock buybacks last year  as well as the billions spent in efforts to bolster Cisco s position in fields like cloud services  cybersecurity  analytics  and low power wide area networks 
Outlook 
As the general market has tried to weigh the macroeconomic impact that the US China trade war has had on the tech sector  Cisco s Q1 guidance did little to spur an assuring sentiment which prompted the selloff  Management s statements about macro level shifts in key markets contributing to softer demand in its service provider category could be cause for concern  especially when considering the sales decline in Q4 in that category 
Management suggests that much of the slowdown is due to enterprises ramping up spending on radio equipment for the transition to 5G  It also said that it will see a sales resurgence in the category once these businesses have the foundation level tech equipment in place to support their transition to the new networking technology 
Our Q1 consensus estimates forecast 8  bottom line growth to  0 81 per share and a tepid increase in net sales to  13 08 billion  Product revenue is projected to slip 0 81  to  9 81 billion and services are estimated to bring in  3 25 billion for a 2 13  gain  Looking ahead to fiscal 2020 s figures  our estimates predict a 1 79  top line jump to  52 83 billion and a 7 42  bottom line climb to  3 33 per share 
Bottom Line 
Cisco is currently facing a number of issues within its operations that have worried investors about a growth slowdown  In addition  the trade war has casted macroeconomic headwinds on Cisco that have weighed on the firm s operations  making it all the more difficult for the company to sustain its growth levels 
However  despite stock buybacks  fast dividend growth  and a big push to acquire businesses and assets  Cisco still boasts a net cash position of roughly  8 billion  The recent pull back in the stock has brought Cisco s forward multiple down to a discounted level that it often doesn t stay at for too long  For investors who may believe that Cisco can turn things around in the long run  the stock s current valuation is at an opportunistic level

for even small gains   UCTT was one of the stocks that made new highs last week and I want to dive deeper into the story to see if the stock is likely to continue to show us strength DescriptionUltra Clean Holdings is a developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment  flat panel  solar and medical device industries  Ultra Clean offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for gas delivery systems and other subassemblies  improved design to delivery cycle times  component neutral design and manufacturing and component testing capabilities  Ultra Clean s customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers for the semiconductor capital equipment  flat panel  solar and medical device industries  Ultra Clean is headquartered in Menlo Park  California Earnings HistoryAs I look at the last four quarters for UCTT  I see a positive picture   Three of the last four reports have topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and not by a little   When the lone miss  a negative earnings suprise of 8   is factored in  the average for the last four reports is still a positive 25  That means the three beats were all pretty big in size   I see positive earnings surprises of 31   16  and 61  respectively    That is what investors like to see Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Rank is an algo that looks for the best moves in earnings estimates   The consensus estimates for UCTT is doing just what investors want to see  its moving higher I see small increases for this quarter  next quarter  this year and next year The Zacks Rank cares the most about the full year number and for 2019 that number has moved from  0 77 to  0 87 over the last 30 days The 2020 number has moved from  1 09 to  1 29 These are big moves    and investors that believe that fundamentals matter know that higher EPS results lead to higher stock prices ValuationLast quarter topline growth was only 8   but that number is expected to increase as demand for UCTT services increases   The stock trades at 26x forward earnings estimates and has a price to book mulitple of 2x   Those are pretty low numbers for the chip industry  EnPro Industriesis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and today it is the Bear of the Day   Let s take a look at why this stock has the lowest Zacks Rank and if there are any good reasons to keep this stock on your radar screen DescriptionEnPro Industries  Inc  is a diversified manufacturer of proprietary engineered products used in critical applications  EnPro Industries are a leader in sealing technologies  metal polymer and filament wound bearings  components and service for reciprocating compressors  diesel and dual fuel engines and other solutions that meet the needs of industries worldwide  EnPro Industries commitment to innovation  quality and value has propelled our brands to wide recognition and leading positions in their markets  EnPro businesses manufacture high quality products and provide high quality services to the customers  These products and services are sold into more than 40 distinct industries with thousands of applications  ranging from jet engines to chemical plants  oil wells to semiconductor clean rooms and Navy ships to tractor trailer trucks  EnPro operates manufacturing facilities in North and South America  Europe and Asia Recent EarningsThe most recent earnings report was a miss of  0 22 or a negative 16  earnings surprise   When that happens  analysts tend to take down their estimates for the full year     and sometime the outlook for next year is lowered as well   This is part of the reason the stock slipped to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Estimate RevisionsEstimate revisions are the primary driver behind the Zacks Rank  as they move up and down the Rank follows right behing   For NPO  the Zacks Consensus Estimate dropped for this quarter  this year and next year The annual numbers carry more weight for the Rank  so the moved from  4 48 to  4 21 for this year really hurt Next year saw a move from  4 87 to  4 45 and that is not a good sign ValuationWhen estimates fall  the stock tends to follow along  and often times  multiples fall as well   The forward PE for NPO is sitting at 16x while the price to book is at 1 6x   Both of those metrics are on the low side  but I see the topline contracting  not growing   The price to sales of 0 93x is less than 1 which means the market doesn t value incremental sales as much as it does for other companies Does Cisco  CSCO  Look Like a Buy Ahead of Q1 Earnings Cisco is set to report its first quarter results after market close on Wednesday  November 13  The tech giant has seen its shares rise 11 5  in 2019 thus far  lagging behind the broader computer office equipment market s over 44  run Cisco is coming off a fiscal year that sent the stock retreating after the company s forward guidance exacerbated worries about a potential slowdown in the tech sector  The company is looking to report a quarter that can set the tone for a strong fiscal 2020  Let s take a closer look at Cisco and what to expect from its first quarter performance Weak Guidance Taints Fiscal 2019 Performance Cisco reported fourth quarter results that beat our estimates on both the bottom and top line fronts  helping the company bolster its overall fiscal 2019 figures  The firm s Q4 metrics brought the company s full year revenue to  51 7 billion  which was up roughly 7  annually  and its adjusted EPS for the period to  3 10  up roughly 20  Despite the encouraging top and bottom line performances from the tech giant  the forward guidance management provided for Q1 2020 sent shares lower as investors weren t satisfied with the company s expected trajectory The company expects sales to come in between 0  to 2  growth year over year in Q1  and its midpoint guidance for adjusted EPS of  0 81 represents Y Y growth of 8   Investors felt that the projected growth didn t justify the  4 5 billion the company spent on stock buybacks last year  as well as the billions spent in efforts to bolster Cisco s position in fields like cloud services  cybersecurity  analytics  and low power wide area networks Outlook As the general market has tried to weigh the macroeconomic impact that the US China trade war has had on the tech sector  Cisco s Q1 guidance did little to spur an assuring sentiment which prompted the selloff  Management s statements about macro level shifts in key markets contributing to softer demand in its service provider category could be cause for concern  especially when considering the sales decline in Q4 in that category Management suggests that much of the slowdown is due to enterprises ramping up spending on radio equipment for the transition to 5G  It also said that it will see a sales resurgence in the category once these businesses have the foundation level tech equipment in place to support their transition to the new networking technology Our Q1 consensus estimates forecast 8  bottom line growth to  0 81 per share and a tepid increase in net sales to  13 08 billion  Product revenue is projected to slip 0 81  to  9 81 billion and services are estimated to bring in  3 25 billion for a 2 13  gain  Looking ahead to fiscal 2020 s figures  our estimates predict a 1 79  top line jump to  52 83 billion and a 7 42  bottom line climb to  3 33 per share Bottom Line Cisco is currently facing a number of issues within its operations that have worried investors about a growth slowdown  In addition  the trade war has casted macroeconomic headwinds on Cisco that have weighed on the firm s operations  making it all the more difficult for the company to sustain its growth levels However  despite stock buybacks  fast dividend growth  and a big push to acquire businesses and assets  Cisco still boasts a net cash position of roughly  8 billion  The recent pull back in the stock has brought Cisco s forward multiple down to a discounted level that it often doesn t stay at for too long  For investors who may believe that Cisco can turn things around in the long run  the stock s current valuation is at an opportunistic level 5 Stocks Set to

215875,437391,CSCO,Cisco Earnings Preview  Slowing Sales May Hurt  But Long Term Potential Is Intact,opinion,"  Reports Q1 2020 results on Wednesday  Nov  13  after the close
  Revenue expectation   13 07 billion
  EPS expectation   0 81
Having warned that the global slowdown is starting to hit its business  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  has successfully set a low bar for its fiscal 2020  first quarter earnings report that s scheduled to be released on Wednesday 
The world s biggest maker of routers  switches and other gear that companies use to connect computers is forecast to make  13 07 billion in sales for the period that ended in September  a flat performance when compared to the same period a year ago  Profit  however  is expected to rise to  0 81 a share from  0 75  according to analysts  consensus forecast 
The ongoing trade dispute between the U S  and China  coupled with a cautious approach by the company s largest customers amid a slowing global economy  are some of the headwinds that are prompting companies to either put a brake on their orders  or reduce their purchases of Cisco products 
These products are considered the backbone of the internet economy  making it an economic bellwether offering visibility on global demand and the future outlook that s hard for investors to ignore 
In the last quarterly report  Cisco reported that emerging markets bookings were down and the Asia Pacific region posted a decline of 8   While Cisco gets less than 3  of its revenue from China  business there has dropped  dramatically   according to the company  Chinese state owned enterprises and some telecom providers that used to use small amounts of Cisco machinery have moved to the sidelines due to the current trade tension 





These negative developments have hit Cisco shares hard  they dropped 17  since reaching a multi year high of  58 26 in July  closing yesterday at  48 10  But despite these headwinds  we still believe Cisco stock is a good value play for long term investors and could be a bet worth taking 
A Solid Global Player
We derive our optimism from the company s solid global position as a network equipment supplier  While the cyclical nature of this segment of the hardware market could continue to put a drag on Cisco s stock performance  it s hard for companies to delay their investments indefinitely for products that are so crucial for their tech infrastructure 
Another reason we re fairly bullish about Cisco is the company s aggressive diversification drive away from hardware to a software driven model within new high growth areas of the market  such as cybersecurity and applications 
Under Chief Executive Officer  Chuck Robbins  Cisco has made a string of acquisitions to build a software and services business  In August  it announced plans to buy closely held Voicea  a maker of software that provides real time transcription and voice search capabilities  In July  it agreed to acquire Acacia Communications Inc  NASDAQ ACIA  for about  2 6 billion  gaining chips and machines that help translate optical signals into electronic data 
These growth initiatives  coupled with the company s dominant position in the America region in which its generates the majority of its sales  have positioned the company to outperform when the macroeconomic risks reduce  In addition to growth  Cisco is also a reliable company that pays regular dividends  making it an attractive option for those seeking to earn a growing income 
With its current annual yield touching about 3   investors are getting  0 35 a share payout  which has risen 14 20  per year during the past five years 
Bottom Line
Cisco is a company which is set to deliver strong growth as it benefits from a good mix of recurring revenue from its legacy business and its focus on the new high margin areas  We believe any post earning weakness on Wednesday should be taken as an opportunity to buy this quality stock ",2019-11-12,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-earnings-preview-slowing-sales-may-hurt-but-longterm-potential-is-intact-200484454,200484454
215876,437392,CSCO,Iran hit by global cyber attack that left U S  flag on screens,news,"DUBAI  Reuters    Hackers have attacked networks in a number of countries including data centers in Iran where they left the image of a U S  flag on screens along with a warning   Don t mess with our elections   the Iranian IT ministry said on Saturday   The attack apparently affected 200 000 router switches across the world in a widespread attack  including 3 500 switches in our country   the Communication and Information Technology Ministry said in a statement carried by Iran s official news agency IRNA  The statement said the attack  which hit internet service providers and cut off web access for subscribers  was made possible by a vulnerability in routers from Cisco  O CSCO  which had earlier issued a warning and provided a patch that some firms had failed to install over the Iranian new year holiday  A blog published on Thursday by Nick Biasini  a threat researcher at Cisco s Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group  said   Several incidents in multiple countries  including some specifically targeting critical infrastructure  have involved the misuse of the Smart Install protocol     As a result  we are taking an active stance  and are urging customers  again  of the elevated risk and available remediation paths   On Saturday evening  Cisco said those postings were a tool to help clients identify weaknesses and repel a cyber attack  Iran s IT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi posted a picture of a computer screen on Twitter with the image of the U S  flag and the hackers  message  He said it was not yet clear who had carried out the attack  Azari Jahromi said the attack mainly affected Europe  India and the United States  state television reported   Some 55 000 devices were affected in the United States and 14 000 in China  and Iran s share of affected devices was 2 percent   Azari Jahromi was quoted as saying  In a tweet  Azari Jahromi said the state computer emergency response body MAHER had shown  weaknesses in providing information to  affected  companies  after the attack which was detected late on Friday in Iran

215885,437401,CSCO,Cisco Systems  CSCO  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 13  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of routers  switches  software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 81 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8  
Revenues are expected to be  13 08 billion  up 0  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 76  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco 
For Cisco  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cisco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of  0 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 83  delivering a surprise of  1 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cisco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-systems-csco-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200482950,200482950

1  Wholesale Inflation  Manufacturing  Labor Data 
Thursday ushers in a deluge of economic reports which could either add to the narrative of a strengthening US economy or dent investor expectations for solid first quarter economic growth 
Inflation at the wholesale level as measured by the producer price index is expected to have rebounded 0 4  in January following an unexpected 0 1  fall in December  The wholesale data will likely attract added investor attention as they are expected to parse the report for signs of further price pressures after Wednesday s consumer inflation report topped economists  forecasts

215938,437454,CSCO,Cisco Outlook Takes Trade War Hit,opinion,"Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   reported revenue and earnings that barely exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 1 3  and 0 4   respectively  But investors are generally more concerned about orders because they are indicative of future performance  That s where Cisco under delivered 
A quick look at the earnings call slides clearly shows that the softness is attributable to the APJC  Asia Pac basically  segment with service provider and enterprise customers being the major pressure 
Service provider issues are nothing new  These customers are cash constrained  From a geographic viewpoint  however  it s clear that APJC played spoil sport  with difficult comps in India and continued weakness in China  Segment orders were down 21  
The 2  decline in enterprise orders was the other negative  with the commentary around it being more disturbing  It appears that the Chinese government isn t inviting bids from Cisco any longer and management says it s related to the trade war  Chinese actions accounted for a point  or half of the decline in enterprise orders 
But that isn t true of the technology sector as a whole  The sector has huge  and growing  exposure to China by virtue of its being the place where the largest chunk of the world s population is located and because it s still in the  developing  country category  To get unceremoniously kicked out of that growth just can t be good or desirable 

Don t Bet Against Cisco Though
China thankfully accounts for just 3  of its business and Asia Pac generates lower margins for the company  So the geographic mix was positive for the gross margin last quarter  The continued mix shift favoring software was also positive 
Second  the transition to a subscription model is largely complete  with 70  of all software revenue now coming through it  The company is including software  and security  in a growing number of services  which is helping subscription revenue  The recurring revenue model lends stability to a business that was earlier harnessed to high end hardware 
As far as product categories are concerned  infrastructure of course remains the largest segment by far  with switching strength at on premise and data center customers and routing hurt by service provider weakness  The applications business was up double digits across segments

215948,437464,CSCO,Chart Of The Day  With Cisco Now A Buy  Why Are Technicals Signaling A Fall ,opinion,"Cisco Systems  the San Jose based networking products giant  is due to report Q4 2019 results on Wednesday  August 14  after the bell  Expectations are for  1 14 EPS and  2 55 billion in revenue  That s versus  1 76 EPS and  3 12 billion for the corresponding quarter last year 
Over the past six years  Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  missed just once on EPS  November 2013  and twice on earnings  November 2018 and February 2019   The company is expected to beat again on Wednesady  after it released a string of upward guidance revisions during the past quarter 

During its previous report  Cisco delivered stronger than expected earnings after the company adjusted prices and worked closely with suppliers to offset problems from the trade war with China  On top of that  the firm reduced its overall China revenue to just 3   

Nevertheless  shares of Cisco closed up 21  YTD on Friday  barely any better than the  20 79  gains over the same time period from its benchmark index  the NASDAQ 100  where its 2 731  weighting makes it the 7th  heaviest  of the index s 100 components 
Why has a company that s seemingly pulled out all the stops to offset trade headwinds not been able to markedly outperform its broader index  The technical charts can provide some insight on supply and demand 


During last Monday s selloff  the stock fell below its rising channel since April  after having already fallen below its uptrend line on July 31  in place since the Christmas Eve rout  Conversely  its index  the NASDAQ 100  found support off its uptrend line of the same period  bouncing off it and confirming the uptrend 
Moreover  after finding support by the 200 DMA  which realigned with the May lows  the price consolidated with an upward bias  After the double digit selloff the week before  this rising congestion has all the telltale signs of a setup for another leg in the downturn 
This scenario fits with the technical pattern  a rising flag bearish after a leg down subsequent to breaking the support of the channel bottom  whose current resistance was confirmed with Friday s fall  and before attempting to take on the 200 DMA for the second time  Note the volume as well  it dried up in the previous rally and spiked amid the selloff 
Volume has also been falling against the rising flag  another sign that demand is drying up  This is further evidence of a coming flag pattern completion with a downside breakout 

Why has Cisco not been able to separate away from the sector  despite its greater independence from Chinese revenue  Though we don t know for sure  an assumption can be made that the company is now hampered by residual negative sentiment  for which Cisco is not at fault 

Or maybe this price action is being driven by informed money  people who may be close to the inner circle and have picked up on negative rumors  Meanwhile  ironically  of 30 analysts  21 now have a buy rating on the stock  with zero providing a  sell  
If there s a downside breakout of the flag  however  we ll be the first to call a sell signal 
Trading StrategiesConservative traders might wait for weekly falling peaks and troughs to establish a long term downtrend 
Moderate traders could enter a short position after the price falls below the 200 DMA and finds resistance upon a return move 
Aggressive traders might be content to short the stock with a downside breakout below  52

215965,437481,CSCO,Cisco Systems  CSCO  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 14  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of routers  switches  software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 82 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 1  
Revenues are expected to be  13 39 billion  up 4 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 52  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco 
For Cisco  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cisco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  1 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cisco appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-systems-csco-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200452272,200452272

215994,437510,CSCO,Why Cisco  CSCO  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   This company  which is in the Zacks Computer   Networking industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this seller of routers  switches  software and services has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 1 34   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Cisco was expected to post earnings of  0 77 per share  but it reported  0 78 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 30   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 72 per share  while it actually produced  0 73 per share  a surprise of 1 39  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Cisco lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cisco has an Earnings ESP of  1 53  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 14  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cisco-csco-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200449353,200449353

216005,437521,CSCO,6 Tech Stocks To Buy Pre Q2 Earnings On Trade Talk Prospects,opinion,Wall Street is continuing its dream run in 2019 despite a sudden collapse of trade negotiations between the United States and China  What is more important is that the primary driving force of the market s bull run is the technology sector  which was likely to be affected the most by lingering tariff related conflicts The technology sector is likely to benefit as U S  China trade talk is likely to resume although an amicable deal is nowhere to be seen  However  both sides have decided to come down from their rigid positions and offer some concessions to each other Technology Sector Soaring in 2019    The technology sector carries the highest weightage  20 1   within the 11 sectors of the broad market S P 500 Index  Technology stocks suffered a severe setback in 2018 and Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  declined 2 9   The tech laden Nasdaq Composite had plunged 3 9  last year However  in 2019  XLK is the best performer of the S P 500  gaining a massive 31 7   well above the benchmark index s gain of 19 9   Notably  on Jul 23  the XLK touched its all time high level of 82 15 before finishing at 82 07  The XLK has gained 4 6  so far in July  Moreover  the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite is also up 24 4  year to date Within the technology sector  the performance of semiconductors is worth mentioning as the industry had a rough 2018  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  was down 2 6  last year  However  the SOX has advanced an astonishing 35 2  year to date and 7 2  so far in July U S  China Trade Negotiations to RestartAfter the abrupt breakdown of U S  China trade talk in May  the two sides have decided to renegotiate from July  Following the successful conclusion of initial telephonic conversations between the two countries  a high level U S  trade delegation headed by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will visit China later this week Meanwhile  the U S  government has decided to relax some restrictions imposed on the Chinese tech behemoth Huawei Technologies  Several U S  tech companies will be given licenses to sell products to Huawei Notably  in May  the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei and refrained it from doing any sort of business with U S  corporates on national security concerns   On the other hand  China has decided to significantly increase imports of U S  agricultural products  especially soya bean Why Trade Solution is Important for Tech SectorChina is the largest trading partner of the United States  A trade spat with the United States resulted in significant slowdown of the Chinese economy  However  a strong Chinese economy will give U S  technology companies a solid boost as China is the largest market for high tech products On the other hand  China also plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  In 2018  the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinses imports worth  300 billion in two phases  Most of these products are from the high tech industrial sectors  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it raised prices of high tech equipment and several electronics products At this juncture  an amicable solution to the U S   China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants Our Top PicksAt this

an optical networking technology company  for  2 6 billion in cash and marketable securities  Consequently  Acacia shareholders will obtain  70 per share in cash  approximately a premium of 46  over the  64 91 price on Jul 8  2019 Cisco anticipates the acquisition to close in the second half of next year subject to customary closing conditions  Post the deal closure  Acacia will join Cisco s Optical Systems and Optics group   networking and security business Massachusetts based Acacia designs  develops  manufactures and markets communication equipments  The company offers coherent optical interconnect products for cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers  It operates primarily in the Americas  Europe  the Middle East  Africa and the Asia Pacific region According to Cisco s executive vice president of its networking and security business  David Goeckeler   The acquisition of Acacia will allow us to build on the strength of our switching  routing and optical networking portfolio to address our customers  most demanding requirements  Shares of the company have gained 30  in a year s time  outperforming the  s rally of 28 4  Synergies from BuyoutThe integration of Acacia s optical technology with Cisco s network and cloud security platforms is likely to enhance security features further  This will help Cisco make more differentiated products  thereby mitigating phishing incidents on devices  This acquisition will aid Cisco to deliver on its commitment of safeguarding customer data while focusing on people centric secure enterprise IT approach Further  the deal will help the company add more fundamental technology to its open source software in order to build networking machinery  With this buyout  Cisco s customers will be able to experience greater flexibility in operations  enhanced multi level security  increased awareness and greater administrative control Acacia is currently an existing supplier to Cisco  The former helps the latter to design and develop high speed  optical interconnect technologies that cater to the ever increasing consumer demand for data We believe that the acquisition will allow both the companies to better integrate technologies  Further  Acacia acquisition will also help Cisco bolster optical system portfolio and allow it to better compete against competitors  The company stated that it will continue to serve Acacia s customers  while also integrating Acacia s technology with its own in order to better serve customers and expand customer base What Investor s Needs to KnowThe growing clout of optics to address emerging network infrastructure demands of power and density deserves a special mention  With Acacia buyout  the company aims to expand optical transceiver portfolio to support higher bandwidth  primarily for its data center customers Increasing internet penetration worldwide is causing higher internet traffic  which in turn is fueling demand for higher bandwidth  In fact  per latest data from Cisco s VNI forecast  worldwide internet traffic is expected to more than triple to 13 2 exabytes per day in 2022  up from 4 1 exabytes per day in 2017 Cisco s Infrastructure Platforms comprise Switching  NGN routing  Wireless and Data Center solutions  which accounted 58 5  of total third quarter fiscal 2019 revenues  Revenues grew 5  from the

promise To ConcludeOver the past few years  strategic acquisitions have played an important role in shaping Cisco s growth trajectory  The company recently concluded the deal to buy Luxtera  The company intends to deploy Luxtera s integrated optics technology capabilities across its robust network portfolio featuring capacities ranging from 100GbE  Gigabit Ethernet  to 400GbE  This will enable Cisco to provide ultra high  data heavy bandwidth services to CSPs and network service providers The company had also announced that it has successfully closed the buyout of privately held Duo Security  This buyout will aid Cisco to deliver on its commitment of safeguarding customer data while focusing on people centric secure enterprise IT approach Continuous strategic acquisitions should support Cisco in expanding product offerings  strengthening footprint in the security markets and building customer base  Further  these buyouts reveal the company s intention to improve its software and service capabilities in order to diversify revenue streams toward sources of a more recurring nature  It is taking this initiative in a bid to mitigate the cyclicality associated with hardware

216023,437539,CSCO,China Could Be A Roadblock In Cisco s Acacia Acquisition,opinion,"Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   has announced its agreement to buy Maynard  Massachusetts based Acacia Communications   NASDAQ ACIA   for  70 a share  or  2 6 billion net of cash and marketable securities  That s a 46  premium to Acacia s closing price on Monday 
The all cash deal  if it goes through  will be the biggest acquisition since AppDynamics  which was taken for  3 7 billion  Over the past year  Cisco also added Duo Security for  2 35 billion in cash and stock and Luxtera for  660 million in cash and assumed equity 
Cisco has for several years  been diversifying beyond its hardware business  as a more software centric approach to solving network issues have started to make more sense and as competitors mushroomed to eat into its revenues 
Acacia has coherent optics technology  which facilitates faster data throughput in optical networks and is therefore of great strategic importance in the industry s move to take on transport speeds of 100 Gbps or more  The company s optics  digital signal processing technology  transceivers and other gear primarily cater to data center operators and telecom companies that are always pressed to offer faster data transfer even as the volume of network data continues to increase 
This therefore makes the portfolio a perfect fit with Cisco s cloud  service provider and enterprise customers  Since Acacia has quite a concentrated customer base with 74  of revenue coming from its top 5 customers  there s great scope for cross selling to Cisco customers 
In fact  Cisco will be able to use Acacia products throughout its network for enhanced throughput for its customers  It will also help customers looking to simplify operations and reduce network complexities to transition from chassis based systems to pluggable technology  The company will of course also support Acacia s current customers 
The acquisition will close in the second half of Cisco s fiscal 2020 ending in June provided that it gets the necessary regulatory approvals  That s where things could get tricky because Acacia s largest customer is China s ZTE  HK 0763   and the company generates 29  of its revenues from China  Thailand accounts for another 20   with Germany  U S  and other countries contributing 17  each  according to Bloomberg  
So Cisco may require Xi s blessings and that may not be forthcoming  given trade tensions with the U S  and the fact that ZTE products were even banned in the U S  between May 15 and July 13 of 2018

216061,437577,CSCO,5 Top Picks To Tap Momentum In Wireless Equipment Space,opinion,The United States is progressing well to lead the world in 5G   the next generation of wireless connectivity   which will enable faster speeds and low latency wireless broadband services  Although 5G network is not likely to replace existing 4G standards on a large scale before 2020  several telecom behemoths are expected to launch 5G smartphones in 2019 As wireless service providers ramp up investments in 5G network  wireless equipment makers are set to benefit significantly  Consequently  shares of wireless equipment manufacturers are also flourishing  Year to date  the wireless equipment industry has gained more than 19  surpassing the market s benchmark S P 500 Index s gain of 15 2  Trump s America Must Win Race BeginsOn Apr 12  President Donald Trump and the FCC unveiled several initiatives to accelerate 5G wireless network deployment in the United States  Trump said   The race to 5G is on and America must win  Per Reuters  the global 5G wireless market size will reach  1 271 billion by 2025  Per Reuters  the market is forecast to grow more than 49 1  over the 2018 2025 period  DELOITTE Global has predicted that 25 telecom operators will launch 5G in 2019 and 26 others will follow suit in 2020  About 20 vendors will launch 5G enabled smartphones in 2019 and over 1 million 5G handsets are likely to be shifted this year The FCC auctioned 1 550 MHz spectrum for commercial use of 5G wireless network  Furthermore  the regulator is going to auction a massive 3 400 MHz of new spectrum in the Upper 37 GHz  39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands  Additionally  the FCC is set to create  20 4 billion  Rural Digital Opportunity fund   to provide high speed broadband connection to 4 million homes and business enterprises in rural areas National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom SpaceAlthough  President Trump reiterated that 5G initiatives should be private sector led  instead of a government developed shared network proposed earlier  national security will be the key issue for the government On May 15  Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency preventing domestic corporates from using information and communications technology equipment from sources as this  poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States  Accordingly  the Department of Commerce banned Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies and its affiliates to do business with U S  companies  President Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry U S  companies that rely on low cost Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of high tech equipment and several electronic products for the telecom sector  However  the ban on Chinese equipment will certainly help U S  and European wireless equipment manufacturers Our Top PicksAgainst this backdrop  we have

216062,437578,CSCO,Here s Why Cisco Systems  CSCO  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cisco Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CSCO that show why this seller of routers  switches  software and services shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CSCO  shares are up 7 5  over the past week while the Zacks Computer   Networking industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 78  compares favorably with the industry s 1 59  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Cisco Systems have increased 7 13  over the past quarter  and have gained 29 97  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 4 24  and 5 78   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CSCO s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CSCO is averaging 21 262 252 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CSCO 
Over the past two months  12 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CSCO s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 06 to  3 08 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CSCO is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Cisco Systems on your short list ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-cisco-systems-csco-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200430881,200430881

Within the main components of the world stock market  there s been a conspicuous rotation of leadership  The formerly high flying Chinese market  iShares MSCI China ETF  NASDAQ MCHI  has retreated over the past month plus  ceding its year to date leadership to Central and Eastern Europe Fund  CEE  

The ongoing trade conflict between the US and China has taken a toll on China s stock market  as defined by MCHI  After a stellar rally in 2019 through the end of April  the ETF began to hit turbulence amid rising concerns that Washington and Beijing were at loggerheads over resolving a trade dispute   a dispute that appears no closer to resolution at the moment 

The possibility of a meeting later this month with President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart  Xi Jinping  offers a ray of hope  But as Reuters notes  expectations are low for the talks between the two leaders at the upcoming G20 summit on June 28 29 in Japan   The atmosphere is poisonous   remarks a senior Beijing based Western diplomat 
The US China trade battle is raising the risk of a worldwide economic slowdown  say analysts and business leaders  For example  US multinational Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  Systems  Chuck Robbins earlier this week said   My biggest fear is that what is going between the US and China may impact the global economy  and desires that the US China get a reasonable resolution as soon as possible which will be good for customers and economy  
If the impasse between the US and China rolls on  weaker growth is a likely outcome  warns Olaf Scholz  the German finance minister   We all hope there will be a way out of these trade tensions  Because every one of us knows that our fundamental economic data are influenced by the insecurity of this situation  As an indirect effect of these insecurities  companies postpone their decisions to invest  
A complicating factor that s come into play in recent days  the Hong Kong protests  which are directed against passing a bill that allows extraditions to mainland China  The political unrest in the city  a major financial center for the world economy  is raising concerns about the future of this quasi independent city state   The business and financial community is deeply concerned about what this may augur for Hong Kong   says Fred Hu  founder of the investment firm Primavera Capital Group 
Meanwhile  a momentum profile of the funds listed above continues to reflect a weaker trend generally via two sets of moving averages  The first definition compares the 10 day moving with the 100 day average  a measure of short term trending behavior  red line in the chart below   A second set of moving averages  50 and 200 days  offers an intermediate measure of the trend  blue line   The indexes range from 0  all funds trending down  to 1 0  all funds trending up   Based on this data through yesterday s close  the bullish climate from earlier in the year remains challenged with a softer trend  But while several components of the global equity market are showing weakness  the overall market via VT remains relatively resilient  at least for now ",2019-06-12,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-equities-hold-on-to-2019-gains-as-headwinds-build-200430793,200430793

216081,437597,CSCO,A scramble at Cisco exposes uncomfortable truths about U S  cyber defense,news,"By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    When WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange disclosed earlier this month that his anti secrecy group had obtained CIA tools for hacking into technology products made by U S  companies  security engineers at Cisco Systems  O CSCO  swung into action   The Wikileaks documents described how the Central Intelligence Agency had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco s widely used Internet switches  which direct electronic traffic  to enable eavesdropping  Senior Cisco managers immediately reassigned staff from other projects to figure out how the CIA hacking tricks worked  so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using the same methods  three employees told Reuters on condition of anonymity  The Cisco engineers worked around the clock for days to analyze the means of attack  create fixes  and craft a stopgap warning about a security risk affecting more than 300 different products  said the employees  who had direct knowledge of the effort   That a major U S  company had to rely on WikiLeaks to learn about security problems well known to U S  intelligence agencies underscores concerns expressed by dozens of current and former U S  intelligence and security officials about the government s approach to cybersecurity  That policy overwhelmingly emphasizes offensive cyber security capabilities over defensive measures  these people told Reuters  even as an increasing number of U S  organizations have been hit by hacks attributed to foreign governments  Larry Pfeiffer  a former senior director of the White House Situation Room in the Obama administration  said now that others were catching up to the United States in their cyber capabilities   maybe it is time to take a pause and fully consider the ramifications of what we re doing   U S  intelligence agencies blamed Russia for the hack of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election  Nation states are also believed to be behind the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2015 breach of the U S  Government s Office of Personnel Management   CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak declined to comment on the Cisco case  but said it was the agency s  job to be innovative  cutting edge  and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad   The Office of the Director of National Intelligence  which oversees the CIA and NSA  referred questions to the White House  which declined to comment  Across the federal government  about 90 percent of all spending on cyber programs is dedicated to offensive efforts  including penetrating the computer systems of adversaries  listening to communications and developing the means to disable or degrade infrastructure  senior intelligence officials told Reuters  President Donald Trump s budget proposal would put about  1 5 billion into cyber security defense at the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   Private industry and the military also spend money to protect themselves  But the secret part of the U S  intelligence budget alone totaled about  50 billion annually as of 2013  documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden show  Just 8 percent of that figure went toward  enhanced cyber security   while 72 percent was dedicated to collecting strategic intelligence and fighting violent extremism   Departing NSA Deputy Director Rick Ledgett confirmed in an interview that 90 percent of government cyber spending was on offensive efforts and agreed it was lopsided   It s actually something we re trying to address  with more appropriations in the military budget  Ledgett said   As the cyber threat rises  the need for more and better cyber defense and information assurance is increasing as well   The long standing emphasis on offense stems in part from the mission of the NSA  which has the most advanced cyber capabilities of any U S  agency  It is responsible for the collection of intelligence overseas and also for helping defend government systems  It mainly aids U S  companies indirectly  by assisting other agencies   I absolutely think we should be placing significantly more effort on the defense  particularly in light of where we are with exponential growth in threats and capabilities and intentions   said Debora Plunkett  who headed the NSA s defensive mission from 2010 to 2014  GOVERNMENT ROLE How big a role the government should play in defending the private sector remains a matter of debate  Former military and intelligence leaders such as ex NSA Director Keith Alexander and former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter say that U S  companies and other institutions cannot be solely responsible for defending themselves against the likes of Russia  China  North Korea and Iran  For tech companies  the government s approach is frustrating  executives and engineers say  Sophisticated hacking campaigns typically rely on flaws in computer products  When the NSA or CIA find such flaws  under current policies they often choose to keep them for

216091,437607,CSCO,U S  stocks take pause from Trump s  longest winning streak in decades ,news,"Investing com   Wall Street took a breather on Thursday and traded lower despite a handful of upbeat economic reports  after a recent rally that President Donald Trump dubbed the  longest winning streak in decades  may have caused markets to opt for consolidation before making their next move 
At 12 13PM ET  17 15GMT   the Dow Jones fell 28 points  or 0 13   the S P 500 lost 6 points  or 0 26   while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 18 points  or 0 31  
President Donald Trump hit headlines as he showed his enthusiasm for recent record highs in stocks in his first tweet of the day on Thursday 



 Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades   he tweeted  adding that there was a  great level of confidence and optimism   even before tax plan rollout  
Experts disagreed over the validity of his statement as it was unclear as to exactly what  winning streak  the President was referring to 
Trump has been credited with being a major catalyst behind Wall Street s impressive rally since election day  with some dubbing it the  Trump Jump    Trump rally  or  Trump trade  as investors welcomed his promises of tax reform  infrastructure spending and deregulation 
The fact is that all three major indices closed at fresh highs Wednesday for a fifth straight day  the best run in 25 years  as traders continued to bet on a pro growth agenda under President Trump 
Others provided arguments that the seven day rise in the S P was only the best since 2013  while the five days of gains for the Dow saw its match last September and Nasdaq  up seven session  saw that a similar upside streak ending just last January 11 
But Business Insider pointed out other impressive statistics that began even before Trump s November win such as the fact that stocks haven t registered a 1  decrease since October 11  its longest run since at least 2006 or the fact that the current bull market run began on March 9  2009 was now the second longest in history  following behind the streak from 1987 to 2000 
The financial news publication also noted that the seven consecutive record high closes in the Nasdaq Composite was its longest streak since 1999 
That date is not without its irony as Investing com noted Thursday in its weekly comic that  recent gains have led to speculation of a near term reversal with some fund managers likening the current stock market euphoria to the dotcom bubble  which reached a peak on the last day of 1999 and then burst dramatically  
Whether or not Thursday s current pause is simply a healthy consolidation of gains or a response to the call of bears claiming that stocks have gone too far too fast remains to be seen 
However  it was clear that a handful of positive economic reports were insufficient to convince traders to continue to pour more money into equities on Thursday 
Weekly jobless claims continued to show a solid labor market as they came in lower than expected  Experts at Bespoke noted that the reading has been below 240 000 in five of the last seven weeks and highlighted that  they didn t go below 240 000 once between December 1973 and December 2016  
The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index showed that activity in the sector soared to 43 3 in February  soaring past expectations at its highest level since 1984 on the back of the biggest one month gain in the reading since June 2009 
 Business activity expanded at a solid clip in New York State   the report from the New York Fed noted   Indexes for the six month outlook suggested that respondents remained highly optimistic about future conditions  
The housing market also showed solid indicators as building permits hit a 14 month high in January  Although housing starts actually fell after an upward revision to December s data  the number of units still settled 22 000 above forecasts 
Despite the better than expected data  the dollar broke an 11 day winning streak on Thursday  falling back against the euro  yen and the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength after hitting its highest in a month a day earlier at 101 75 
Comments by Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen in testimony to Congress this week showed that the central bank was on track to continue with gradual rate hikes and had supported the greenback 
On Thursday  Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer noted that he expected the labor market to strengthen further and said in the interview on Bloomberg Television that inflation was moving towards the 2  target 
Fischer further repeated the idea that rate hikes would be gradual though he refrained from specifying how many there would be 
The Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart told the same news agency in a later interview Thursday that he  could probably go either way  on a March rate hike 
Lockhart also insisted that the Fed could hike in May or any of the meetings without a press conference 
In any case  it should be noted that Lockhart will retire in 12 days  before the March meeting 
In big moves on earnings   Avon Products   NYSE AVP  tanked 18  as a 2 4  drop in revenue caused the cosmetic maker to miss consensus 
Shares in TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP  also sank nearly 9  on Thursday as the online travel company disappointed on both the top and bottom line 
Dean Foods  NYSE DF  slumped 7  as the largest U S  dairy processor issued a first quarter profit guidance well below consensus 
On the upside  Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  jumped nearly 3  as revenue in the blue chip s security business  which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems  rose 14  to  528 million  beating analyst forecasts for  519 1 million 
Also in the headlines  Snap Inc  owner of the popular messaging app Snapchat  was reported to be seeking a valuation of between  16 20 billion and  18 52 billion in its highly awaited initial public offering  below speculation that had pointed to a range of  20 to  25 billion 
Meanwhile  oil prices moved lower in U S  midday trade on Thursday turning around from initial gains on the back of OPEC sources cited by Reuters who said the reduction in crude production could be extended or deepened at the May meeting if oil stocks are still too high 
Oil prices have been stuck in a narrow range around the lower to mid  50s over the past two months as investors weigh the impact of cuts in supply from the historic OPEC non OPEC agreement against record stockpiles of crude and increased drilling activity in the United States 
U S  crude futures lost 0 36  to  52 92 by 12 15PM ET  17 15GMT   while Brent oil traded down 0 77  to  55 32",2017-02-16,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-stocks-take-pause-from-trump’s-‘longest-winning-streak-in-decades’-460439,460439

216093,437609,CSCO,Snap vaults venture investor Lightspeed into the Silicon Valley elite,news,"By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    A decade ago  Lightspeed Venture Partners was an obscure firm investing in highly technical startups that were mostly unknown outside of Silicon Valley  The firm is now poised to cash in handily on the biggest technology IPO in three years   Snap Inc   N SNAP   which is set to make its public market debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday at a valuation that could top  22 billion  Lightspeed stands to reap one of its best returns from an investment that started as a  485 000 bet on a college student  That investment in the owner of social media app Snapchat promises a big boost to Lightspeed s status in the fiercely competitive Silicon Valley venture capital community  Firms that are perceived to pick the best companies  a group that includes Benchmark  Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz  can often beat out other VCs for coveted deals and raise more funding from their limited partners   Monster IPOs in particular can be quite significant   said Beezer Clarkson  a limited partner and managing director with Sapphire Ventures   A fund s reputation is strengthened  which can mean enhanced deal flow and greater confidence that lightning will strike again   Lightspeed owns 87 million Snap shares  according to public filings  or 8 6 percent of the company  At the top of the expected IPO price range of  14 to  16 per share  that stake would be worth about  1 4 billion  It was the sole investor in Snap s  485 000 seed round in 2012  an early stake that super charged Lightspeed s returns  A particularly big winner on Thursday will be Jeremy Liew  the Lightspeed partner who led the Snap investment   If you re a venture investor and you can bag a dragon  that s a spectacular outcome   said Chris Albinson  co founder and managing director of Founders Circle Capital   That individual gets to do the victory lap and ride that for awhile    And Lightspeed s breakout is not limited to Snap  Cisco Systems Inc  O CSCO  bought software firm AppDynamics in January for  3 7 billion  and Lightspeed s cut of the deal is expected to return more than the entire  480 million fund the firm raised in 2006  Nutanix  a cloud computing company that went public last year at a  2 2 billion valuation  was another big winner  Lightspeed is also the largest shareholder in MuleSoft  an enterprise software company that filed for an initial public offering in mid February  MuleSoft  AppDynamics and Nutanix are all part of Lightspeed s 2006 fund   Lightspeed declined to comment  citing U S  Securities and Exchange Commission rules that require investors to remain quiet during an IPO process  Graphic on Lightspeed s deal flow   STRATEGY SHIFT Lightspeed was launched in 1999 by four partners who were experts in enterprise software and early internet companies  making only the occasional investment into consumer technology companies  But then came the rise of social media  In 2006 Lightspeed hired Liew  who had been at AOL in operations and management roles  He did not have a highly technical background  but did have a knack for marketing and a strong personality that Lightspeed thought would raise the firm s profile and help it break into the consumer sector  Sources close to Liew  45  describe him as an investor who will travel halfway across the world and stay in a mediocre hotel to get a deal done  He is a fanatical researcher who once read Cosmo Girl and Teen Vogue  magazines for teenage girls  on the premise that consumer technology that enters the popular culture is first adopted by young women  who might lead him to the next hot company  He is well known around Silicon Valley for his splashy wardrobe  which includes a selection of festive pants   He comes in and he wears his yellow pants and his crazy shirts and spews off some really smart things and people say   I guess this guy really knows what he is talking about    said Brian Lee  co founder and chief executive of The Honest Company   Liew was the first investor in The Honest Company and backed Lee s previous startup  ShoeDazzle  And he attended a bitcoin conference in 2013  when the cryptocurrency was still viewed  as kind of a joke   said Peter Smith  CEO of digital currency startup Blockchain  where Liew is a board member   He is exploring markets that most people think are nuts   Smith said  PayPal co founder Max Levchin  now CEO of lending startup Affirm  met Liew when he tried to hire him around 2005  just before Liew went to Lightspeed  Years later  Liew reached out about Affirm  and  he basically followed me around for about a year before I was ready to take money   Levchin said   Liew was the first outside investor in Affirm  alongside Khosla Ventures  A shrewd dealmaker  Liew is described by many as prickly and outright abrasive in his critique of entrepreneurs   Smith said Liew once sat in on his interview with a prospective employee  after which Smith got an earful on his interviewing style   If he has bad news for you he doesn t put it between two slices of good news   Smith said   Liew and Lightspeed will now be under pressure to show they can repeat their success  They have some irons in the fire  with The Honest Company valued at about  1 7 billion by private investors  though it will be tough to match the Snap windfall  But the firm has plenty of money to play with  Lightspeed s fund size has more than doubled since 2006  and it closed its 11th fund at  1 2 billion last year    Everyone in the Valley knows them now  and before that wasn t the case   said Curtis Lee  co founder and CEO of Luxe  an on demand parking company backed by Liew   When I used to tell people about them I used to get blank stares

216101,437617,CSCO,Cisco AppDynamics deal seeks to boost ratio of software revenue,news," This January 25 story was refiled to correct misspelling in headline  By Stephen Nellis  Reuters    Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  Inc s decision to acquire software startup AppDynamics for  3 7 billion  nearly double the private market valuation  reflects Cisco s struggles in building its software business  according to company financial reports and internal documents  The push by Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins to boost the share of revenues from software stalled in the most recent quarter  Executives on its earnings call said 29 percent of Cisco s  12 4 billion in fiscal first quarter revenues came from recurring software and services  That was barely up from 28 percent in the previous quarter  which was only a slight increase from 25 percent a year earlier  One of Cisco s key product lines is dramatically underperforming that software revenue ratio  according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters  Cisco s N9000 switch uses a mix of hardware and software to route information to data centers  Cisco paid  863 million in 2013 for the technology from a startup named Insieme  hoping to boost software revenue in its networking division  But the document showed that as of the end of fiscal 2016 year last summer  Cisco had  888 million in contracts for N9000 switches  which does include a software component  but only  89 million in connected contracts for the so called Application Centric Infrastructure software product designed to be sold alongside it  Those numbers suggest a software to hardware revenue ratio of about 10 percent  below Cisco s overall average  A company spokesman would not comment on unreleased financial figures or say what percentage of switch revenue comes from software  While the N9000 switch will be a small part of Cisco s revenue  the lagging software component could help explain why Cisco was eager to pay a premium for AppDynamics  Cisco spokesman Jim Brady noted that in its most recent quarter  the amount of deferred revenue attributable to recurring software sales grew 48 percent  an indicator that software revenue will grow   As we continue to evolve our business toward a more software centric  recurring revenue model  we are very pleased with our incremental growth in this area   Brady said   We feel the acquisition of AppDynamics     will also accelerate our transition toward software based solutions that deliver predictable and recurring revenue

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 30   A quarter ago  it was expected that this seller of routers  switches  software and services would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 73  delivering a surprise of 1 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Cisco  which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Networking industry  posted revenues of  12 96 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 64   This compares to year ago revenues of  12 46 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters

Cisco shares have added about 20 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 1  
What s Next for Cisco 
While Cisco has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cisco was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

216147,437663,CSCO,Exclusive  Probe of leaked U S  NSA hacking tools examines operative s  mistake ,news,By Joseph Menn and John Walcott SAN FRANCISCO WASHINGTON  Reuters    A U S  investigation into a leak of hacking tools used by the National Security Agency is focusing on a theory that one of its operatives carelessly left them available on a remote computer and Russian hackers found them  four people with direct knowledge of the probe told Reuters  The tools  which enable hackers to exploit software flaws in computer and communications systems from vendors such as Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  and Fortinet Inc  were dumped onto public websites last month by a group calling itself Shadow Brokers  The public release of the tools coincided with U S  officials saying they had concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible for hacking political party organizations in the run up to the Nov  8 presidential election  On Thursday  lawmakers accused Russia of being responsible  Various explanations have been floated by officials in Washington as to how the tools were stolen  Some feared it was the work of a leaker similar to former agency contractor Edward Snowden  while others suspected the Russians might have hacked into NSA headquarters in Fort Meade  Maryland  But officials heading the FBI led investigation now discount both of those scenarios  the people said in separate interviews   NSA officials have told investigators that an employee or contractor made the mistake about three years ago during an operation that used the tools  the people said  That person acknowledged the error shortly afterward  they said  But the NSA did not inform the companies of the danger when it first discovered the exposure of the tools  the sources said  Since the public release of the tools  the companies involved have issued patches in the systems to protect them  Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the former NSA person  who has since departed the agency for other reasons  left the tools exposed deliberately  Another possibility  two of the sources said  is that more than one person at the headquarters or a remote location made similar mistakes or compounded each other s missteps   Representatives of the NSA  the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the office of the Director of National Intelligence all declined to comment  After the discovery  the NSA tuned its sensors to detect use of any of the tools by other parties  especially foreign adversaries with strong cyber espionage operations  such as China and Russia  That could have helped identify rival powers  hacking targets  potentially leading them to be defended better  It might also have allowed U S officials to see deeper into rival hacking operations while enabling the NSA itself to continue using the tools for its own operations  Because the sensors did not detect foreign spies or criminals using the tools on U S  or allied targets  the NSA did not feel obligated to immediately warn the U S  manufacturers  an official and one other person familiar with the matter said  In this case  as in more commonplace discoveries of security flaws  U S  officials weigh what intelligence they could gather by keeping the flaws secret against the risk to U S  companies and individuals if adversaries find the same flaws   Critics of the Obama administration s policies for making those decisions have cited the Shadow Brokers dump as evidence that the balance has tipped too far toward intelligence gathering   The investigators have not determined conclusively that the Shadow Brokers group is affiliated with the Russian government  but that is the presumption  said one of the people familiar with the probe and a fifth person   One reason for suspecting government instead of criminal involvement  officials said  is that the hackers revealed the NSA tools rather than immediately selling them   The publication of the code  on the heels of leaks of emails by Democratic Party officials and preceding leaks of emails by former U S  Secretary of State Colin Powell  could be part of a pattern of spreading harmful and occasionally false information to further the Russian agenda  said Jim Lewis  a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies   The dumping is a tactic they ve been developing for the last five years or so   Lewis said   They try it  and if we don t respond they go a little further next time  ,2016-09-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive:-probe-of-leaked-u.s.-nsa-hacking-tools-examines-operative's-'mistake'-427965,427965

216153,437669,CSCO,Mind the air gap  Singapore s web cut off balances security  inconvenience,news,"By Jeremy Wagstaff and Aradhana Aravindan SINGAPORE  Reuters    Singapore is working on how to implement a policy to cut off web access for public servants as a defense against potential cyber attack   a move closely watched by critics who say it marks a retreat for a technologically advanced city state that has trademarked the term  smart nation   Some security experts say the policy  due to be in place by May  risks damaging productivity among civil servants and those working at more than four dozen statutory boards  and cutting them off from the people they serve  It may only raise slightly the defensive walls against cyber attack  they say  Ben Desjardins  director of security solutions at network security firm Radware  called it  one of the more extreme measures I can recall by a large public organization to combat cyber security risks   Stephen Dane  a Hong Kong based managing director at networking company Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   said it was  a most unusual situation   and Ramki Thurimella  chair of the computer science department at the University of Denver  called it both  unprecedented  and  a little excessive   But not everyone takes that view  Other cyber security experts agree with Singapore authorities that with the kind of threats governments face today it has little choice but to restrict internet access  FireEye  a cyber security company  found that organizations in Southeast Asia were 80 percent more likely than the global average to be hit by an advanced cyber attack  with those close to tensions over the South China Sea   where China and others have overlapping claims   were particularly targeted  Bryce Boland  FireEye s chief technology officer for Asia Pacific  said Singapore s approach needed to be seen in this light   My view is not that they re blocking internet access for government employees  it s that they are blocking government computer access from Internet based cyber crime and espionage    AIR GAPPING  Singapore officials say no particular attack triggered the decision  but noted a breach of one ministry last year  David Koh  chief executive of the newly formed Cyber Security Agency  said officials realized there was too much data to secure and the threat  is too real   Singapore needed to restrict its perimeter  but  said Koh   there is no way to secure this because the attack surface is like a building with a zillion windows  doors  fire escapes    Koh said he was simply widening a practice of ministries and agencies in sensitive fields  where computers are already disconnected  or air gapped  from the Internet   Public servants will still be able to surf the web  but only on separate personal or agency issued devices  Air gapping is common in security related fields  both in government and business  but not for normal government functions  Also  it doesn t guarantee success  Anthony James  chief marketing officer at cyber security company TrapX Security  recalled one case where an attacker was able to steal data from a law enforcement client after an employee connected his laptop to two supposedly separated networks   Human decisions and related policy gaps are the No 1 cause of failure for this strategy   he said    STOPPING THE INEVITABLE    Indeed  just making it work is the first headache  The Infocomm Development Authority  IDA  said in an email to Reuters that it has worked with agencies on managing the changes  to ensure a smooth transition   and was  exploring innovative work solutions to ensure work processes remain efficient   Johnny Wong  group director at the Housing Development Board s research arm  called the move  inconvenient   but said  it s something we just have to adapt to as part of our work    At the Land Transport Authority  a group director  Lew Yii Der  said   Lots of committees are being formed across the public sector and within agencies like mine to look at how we can work around the segregation and ensure front facing services remain the same   Then there s convincing the rank and file public servant that it s worth doing   and not circumventing  One 23 year old manager  who gave only her family name  Ng  said blocking web access would only harm productivity and may not stop attacks   Information may leak through other means  so blocking the Internet may not stop the inevitable from happening   she said  It s not just the critics who are watching closely  Local media cited one Singapore minister as saying other governments  which he did not name  had expressed interest in its approach  Whether they will adopt the practice permanently is less clear  says William Saito  a special cyber security adviser to the Japanese government   There s a trend in private business and some government agencies  in Asia to go along similar lines  he said  noting some Japanese companies cut internet access in the past year  usually after a breach   They cut themselves off because they thought it was a good idea   he told Reuters   but then they realized they were pretty dependent on this Internet thing   Indeed  some cyber security experts said Singapore may end up regretting its decision   I m fairly certain they would regret it and wind up far behind other nations in development   said Arian Evans  vice president of product strategy at RiskIQ  a cyber security start up based in San Francisco  
The decision is  surprising for a country like Singapore that has always been a leader in innovation  technology and business   he said ",2016-08-23,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/mind-the-air-gap:-singapore's-web-cut-off-balances-security,-inconvenience-421981",421981

216159,437675,CSCO,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Cisco Systems  CSCO  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cisco Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CSCO is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this seller of routers  switches  software and services holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CSCO  shares are up 2 37  over the past week while the Zacks Computer   Networking industry is up 1 37  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 64  compares favorably with the industry s 1 74  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Cisco Systems have increased 27 68  over the past quarter  and have gained 32 02  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 14 77  and 10 75   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CSCO s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CSCO is currently averaging 20 397 636 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CSCO 
Over the past two months  13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CSCO s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 02 to  3 06 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  13 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line

Global Growth Projections for IIoT
According to   the IIoT market is set to witness compound annual growth rate of 33 4  during the period of 2018 2023  up from  3 27 billion in 2018 to  13 82 billion by 2023 
North America is anticipated to emerge as the global leader in the IIoT market by virtue of its technological advancement  with the United States and Canada being major contributors  Asia Pacific region is estimated to witness the highest CAGR during 2018 2023 

IIoT Holds the Ultimate Solution for Manufacturing Industry
Rising demand for efficient manufacturing systems  location tracking  centralized monitoring and prediction of faults for maintenance are some of the major factors boosting the IIoT market

Australia s dollar won the wooden spoon among Group of 10 currencies last year  beating its New Zealand cousin in a race to the bottom  This year the contest is a race to the top 
Both commodity currencies are rallying in 2019 after the Federal Reserve turned dovish and as China introduces a slew of measures to bolster flagging growth  The Aussie and kiwi have both strengthened about 3 percent since the start of January  after sliding 9 7 percent and 5 3 percent respectively in 2018 
The first half of February will go a long way to proving if the Aussie or kiwi is the real deal  with interest rate decisions from the two central banks along with the Australia central bank s quarterly assessment of economic conditions and key New Zealand job data    
The Aussie may get a further leg up if the RBA gives out any further hawkish signals in this Tuesday s policy statement  For the kiwi  any improvement in employment and wage data on Thursday would back up recent gains in business sentiment  and possibly herald a more positive tone when policymakers meet on Feb  13   Bloomberg

This seller of routers  switches  software and services has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 81  
For the last reported quarter  Cisco came out with earnings of  0 75 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 72 per share  representing a surprise of 4 17   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 69 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 70 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 45  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Cisco  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cisco currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 28   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 13  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-cisco-csco-200376062,200376062

216336,437852,CSCO,Cisco Systems  CSCO  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 14  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of routers  switches  software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 72 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18  
Revenues are expected to be  12 87 billion  up 6 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 17  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco 
For Cisco  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cisco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of  0 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 70  delivering a surprise of  1 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cisco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-systems-csco-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200356284,200356284

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 17   A quarter ago  it was expected that this seller of routers  switches  software and services would post earnings of  0 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 70  delivering a surprise of 1 45

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cisco shares have added about 17 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 8  
What s Next for Cisco 
While Cisco has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

216339,437855,CSCO,U S  tech firm Cisco to invest  10 billion in China expansion,news,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING  Reuters    Cisco  O CSCO  plans to invest more than  10 billion in China along with local business partners over the next several years  the U S  network equipment maker said on Wednesday  as it seeks to shore up its position against strong domestic rivals 
Cisco  the world s biggest maker of switching equipment and routers that run the Internet  announced the investment plans following high level meetings between top executives and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang and other government agency leaders 
A statement issued by the Silicon Valley company provided the broad outlines of how it planned to invest but did not detail any specific spending or timelines for doing so 
It said in a statement it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding  MoU  with China s state planner  the National Development and Reform Commission  to expand investment 
This will be used to fund innovation  equity investment  research and development and job creation  Cisco said 
It also signed an MoU with the Association of Universities  Colleges  of Applied Science  AUAS  to advance technical training of information and communications engineers 
The company said it will invest in a four year network engineer training program with 100 universities and colleges of applied science recommended by AUAS 
Cisco is looking to capitalize on initiatives promoted by the Chinese government including  China Manufacturing 2025    Internet   and its strategy to deliver more services as cloud based Internet services 
The move comes as pressure has grown on foreign technology firms in the world s biggest Internet market as Beijing has moved to promote domestic technology suppliers it says are needed to protect state secrets and data 
Earlier this year  a Reuters analysis found Cisco was among U S  technology firms which had been dropped from state procurement lists in recent years 
Cisco and arch rival Huawei Technologies  HWT UL  of China have been battling each other for a decade  Political controversies over ties to their respective governments have raised questions about their futures on each other s lucrative home turf 
In 2013  John Chambers  Cisco s long serving chairman and chief executive  acknowledged that security controversies had stymied the company s moves to expand in China 
Chambers took part in the recent meetings with Chinese government officials along with CEO Designate Chuck Robbins  who is scheduled to take over as chief executive in July  Chambers will remain as executive chairman of the company ",2015-06-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-tech-firm-cisco-to-invest-$10-billion-in-china-expansion-347009,347009

216350,437866,CSCO,Conspicuous Weakness In Market Internals A Bad Omen For Stocks ,opinion,"One week ago  FactSet revealed that 250 of the stocks in the S P 500 had dropped more than 20  from all time peaks  The index itself  however  had only declined a modest 5  from its record top 
Today  there are more indications of market distress  The Russell 2000  a popular small cap barometer  has dropped 13  from its high  The Dow Jones Transportation Average has fallen 13  as well  And the Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  is sitting at a 52 week low 

Theoretically  shares of financial institutions should perform well when the economy is firing on all cylinders  However  the investment community is expressing concern about higher interest rates and the credit risks associated with outstanding loans 
Is another financial crisis lurking  That depends on one s perspective on developments abroad 
For example  Italy s battle with the European Union has revived fears about bank exposure to Italian sovereign debt  The iShares European Financials ETF  NASDAQ EUFN  is down 26 5  from its 52 week high water mark 

In contrast  price depreciation for U S  assets has largely coincided with a  hawkish  Federal Reserve  Chairman Powell and committee member colleagues appear resolute in hiking the overnight lending rate four more times by the end of 2019 
On the surface  pushing the Fed Funds Rate  FFR  from the 2  level to the 3  level across a 12 month span may not seem like a big deal  On the flip side  the shift from zero percent rate policy to where we currently stand  2   has adversely impacted mortgage rates and home affordability  The latter is at a 10 year low 

Another concern may be profit margins  When one couples higher borrowing costs with higher labor costs  U S  dollar strength and tariffs  it is not too difficult to forecast deceleration in U S  corporate profit growth 
It follows that some of the volatility and rapid fire selling of stock assets relate to investors rethinking valuations  For instance  year over year earnings growth comparisons lose the tax cut benefit in the first quarter of 2019  Higher overall costs are likely to hinder profitability  And previous claims regarding a low rate justification for exceedingly high stock valuations falls by the wayside 
At present  market internals look horrendous  Nearly one quarter of securities trading on the NYSE have hit 52 week lows  In fact  the New York Stock Exchange High Low Index has not pointed to market breadth this troublesome since the world s central banks  e g   Bank of Japan  European Central Bank  etc   injected trillions of quantitative easing stimulus into the global financial system nearly three years ago 

Back then  the U S  Fed backed off its four rate hike plan for 2016 by telegraphing an intention for a single year end hike  The markets rejoiced  Today  the U S  Fed is decidedly in favor of regular rate hikes and shows little indication of capitulating to critics 
Back then  the world s central banks were willing to create trillions of currency credits to push bond yields lower  even negative  Today  None of the world s influential central banks are discussing emergency stimulus measures 
Granted  there may be little evidence of a U S  based recession in sight  Nevertheless  decreasing liquidity  tighter credit and asset price depreciation themselves can bring about recessionary pressure 
Not sure about that  Then you may have a short memory 
A bursting of the technology stock bubble preceded the 2001 economic downturn  It came about in a Fed tightening cycle  Meanwhile  the popping of the residential housing balloon preceded the Great Recession  It occurred after the Fed kept rates too low for too long  before slowly hiking rates 17 times to a level that it considered  neutral  
So here we are again  Asset prices are falling or flat lining at a time when the overwhelming majority of economists and Fed committee members see nothing but blue skies for years to come 
Me  I see speculative behavior in clients that remind me of when I co hosted a national talk radio show in 1999  Then  callers peppered me with inquiries about the New Economy s dot com revolution  What did I think about Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   JDS Uniphase  JDSU  and Sun Microsystems  SUNW   Now clients are interested in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and cannibis stocks like Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY  
Even when we step outside of the crazes that emulate a MegaMillions lottery  the notion of normal seems skewed  Right now  there are are more U S  stocks trading at insane price to sales ratios of 10x revenue than at any moment since the 2000 tech top 

I am not advocating a panicky run for the exit on all of one s holdings  That said  I see every reason to be patient with a larger than usual percentage allocation to cash equivalents ",2018-10-24,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/conspicuous-weakness-in-market-internals-a-bad-omen-for-stocks-200350423,200350423

216400,437916,CSCO,Chart Of The Day  Is Cisco s  Earnings Downtrend  About To End ,opinion,"Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is slated to release corporate results for Q3 2018 today after the market close  Eight Zacks Investment Research analysts forecast that the networking and IT products giant will show EPS of  0 59 EPS up from the  0 54 EPS it posted for the same quarter last year 
For Cisco  2017 was a good year  Even as growth stagnated  the company increased its value by more than 25   Although growth this year declined to 20 percent  that s still significantly better than the NASDAQ Composite s relatively paltry 6 45 percent or even the NASDAQ 100 s 7 75 percent gain YTD 
After the first revenue growth in the last quarter  should Cisco s revenue guidance of 3 percent YoY materialize  bringing that metric to just under  12 billion  it would break the company s revenue downtrend  seen over the last two years 

Stocks are an economic leading indicator  Cisco shares last week recorded their highest close since the 2000 tech bubble   46 30 only 7 cents below the session high of  46 37  registered that same day 
Any stock that escaped the recent volatility unscathed demonstrates that its shareholders are loyal  It also indicates the stock could potentially withstand future swings in the future 
This is important  Future stock market volatility is likely as geopolitics take surprising turns and economic data signal conflicting messages about rates  against the backdrop of the highest US yields since 2011 
In the four sessions that followed Cisco s highest close since the 2000 tech bubble  the stock corrected 2 75 percent as of yesterday s intraday low  However  the price rebounded and closed only 2 00 percent lower than last week s record 
This higher close formed a Hammer  demonstrating that bulls had the last word  The proximity to the uptrend line since the beginning of April underscores the uptrend  suggesting an ideal entry for a long position  if traders can disregard the geopolitics and rising yields  as they mostly have done thus far  In any case  that s why equity management is key for consistent trading success 
Trading Strategies   Long Position Setup
Conservative traders may wait for a higher peak to confirm that prices may continue to rise despite geopolitics and the sudden renewed of 3 more rate hikes this year 
Moderate traders would be satisfied with a higher close than yesterday 
Aggressive traders may enter now  providing they can afford a stop loss below the uptrend line at  44 7 per the current angle or the presumed support at the  44 00 congestion  alternatively  they may wait for a buying dip toward these levels 
Equity Management
Traders are advised against entering trades with less than a 1 3 risk reward ratio  To achieve this  work out your risk  based on the stop loss and potential reward  based on your target relative to your entry price 
Example

Entry   45 00
Stop loss   44 50
Risk   0 50  target must be at least  1 50 to achieve 1 3 RRR 
Target   46 50
Reward   1 50

216402,437918,CSCO,Intraday Examination  Cisco  Treasurys  S P  Nasdaq,opinion,"One of the few big companies left to report earnings was Cisco  It doesn t look like the market is taking the news especially well  There was a time in history  around 2000  such a drop would guarantee a huge down day tomorrow  Errr  not so much anymore  Cisco isn t the largest company on the planet like it used to be  Indeed  no one gives a crap anymore  Not one crap 

My  huzzah   moment today was how the fight back on bonds got smushed  You can see how bonds tried to rally  green tint   but it flopped over and ended at the lows of the day  Yay 

This pattern fits within the broader context of the daily chart below  Indeed  the fractal is pretty amazing 

As for equities in general     meh  It seems like we can t get more than one stinking down day anymore  We had a little dip yesterday  but  lo and behold  we had to flip it right around Wednesday  Quite annoying  We need to hold below 2750 on the ES to keep me and the other two bears on the planet from going suicidal 

Likewise  the NASDAQ needs to stay below the peak it made on Monday 

Generally speaking  it s far more important for me to see bonds continue to weaken than it is for the likes of the NASDAQ to behave itself  but I gotta tell ya  it sure would help if the red numbers were a little more consistent among all the asset classes ",2018-05-17,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intraday-examination-200316826,200316826
216403,437919,CSCO,Cisco Down Despite Upbeat Q3 Earnings,opinion,"American technology company Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  shares fell more than 4  during the after hours trading on Wednesday despite a better than expected quarterly earnings report that exceeded estimates 
The company posted a weak guidance for its upcoming fiscal fourth quarter report  According to Cisco  the company expects earnings of around 68 to 70 cents per share as well as a revenue growth of 4  to 6  
Fiscal Q3 Results
For the quarter that ended on April 28  Cisco posted earnings of  0 66 per share beating analyst estimates of  0 65 per share in earnings  Cisco s revenue came in at  12 46 billion for the quarter also exceeding analyst forecasts of  12 43 billion 
Majority of the company s revenue is still comprised of its hardware business which has shown a sales growth only during the two out of nine previous quarterly earnings report  Cisco chief executive officer Chuck Robbins has extended his efforts in making the company depend less on the market for expensive equipment through the company being able to make its own hardware as well as being able to sell more networking services as well as software 
Currently  Cisco has increased its networking gear spending which is currently keeping the company s main business up which would allow more time for the company to increase its backlog of deferred software as well as translate its revenue into more sustained sales growth 
Robbins also added that this strategy which was created three years ago is working and that the company is pleased with their recent actions and steps  The new business model is expected to deliver faster revenue growth for the company as it makes more progress into switching its customers from traditional switching and routing to software products 
During the previous quarter  Cisco shares also rose in February when the company posted its fiscal second quarter earnings results with their earnings coming in at  0 63 per share compared to analyst expectations of  0 59 per share while their revenue came in at  11 89 billion compared to analyst expectations of  11 81 billion 
The company remains optimistic on demand globally as they had been for a long time according to Robbins  The company also expects another period of sales growth  However  most analysts and investors have forecasted a higher growth number from the company in the coming months 
While Cisco remained optimistic regarding the demand  a weak demand has been seen from video service provider customers as well as routers which required machines to connect networks to each other and is not currently expected in the current period according to Cisco chief financial officer Kelly Kramer during the conference call ",2018-05-17,trade 12,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-down-despite-upbeat-q3-earnings-200317048,200317048

216427,437943,CSCO,Exclusive  China Telecom plans bid to build Mexico broadband network   sources,news,By Christine Murray MEXICO CITY  Reuters    China s third largest carrier China Telecom is preparing a possible bid for a contract to build and run a new mobile broadband network in Mexico and is seeking local partners to join it in a consortium  three people with knowledge of the matter said  It has already secured up to several billion dollars of financing from Chinese state controlled banks  including the China Development Bank  for the project  which Mexico estimates will cost  10 billion over 10 years  one of the people said  The proposed network is part of a sweeping reform designed to break billionaire Carlos Slim s hold on the Mexican telecoms business  but the Chinese involvement could prove controversial and trigger concerns from the U S   some Mexican officials say  Mexico s government is trying to ease its economic dependence on the United States and ramp up Chinese investment  A Chinese led consortium looks poised to win a  3 75 billion contract to build a high speed train system  sources with knowledge of the plan say  This is despite the group s previous winning bid being revoked late last year amid a political scandal  Representatives for China Telecom did not return requests for comment  and representatives for China Development Bank could not be reached for comment   A spokesman for Mexico s Communications and Transport Ministry  SCT  declined to comment  On a trip to China in November to reduce tensions caused by the train contract cancellation  Communications and Transport Minister Gerardo Ruiz Esparza also discussed the mobile network plan with the Chinese government  according to a ministry press release  State owned China Telecom s international subsidiary China Telecom Global wants to be an operating partner in the network and not just an investor  said the people  who requested anonymity   It is still looking for Mexican partners  the people said  It was unclear who had been approached  GOVERNMENT ASSETS The people did not say how big a stake the Chinese would take in the consortium that would make the bid  Under a government timeline published last year  the tender should have begun last month  with a winner due to be chosen in August this year      Creation of the wholesale network was written into Mexico s constitution as part of telecom market reforms in 2013  It aims to allow Slim s mobile competitors better coverage without using the network of his company America Movil  or bearing the cost of building their own  Under current plans  Mexico s government will not take a stake in the company that runs the network  according to two of the sources  Instead  the winning group will have a public private partnership contract with the government which will allow it use of some state infrastructure  such as sites to build towers on and a fiber optic network owned by the state electricity firm   It will also have a concession for use of 90 MHz of the valuable 700 MHz spectrum   In exchange the network will have to cover large parts of the country with the exact coverage to be decided in the tender  The winning company would then subcontract telecoms equipment makers to build and maintain the network  If the Chinese bid wins  it would mean the Chinese government indirectly owning part of a telecoms network that would cover most of Mexico right up to the U S  border  Many large U S  companies also have operations in Mexico  Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei  HWT UL  has expressed interest in the project and would be more likely to supply parts to the network if it is Chinese led and financed  as has happened in other deals outside China  Huawei has been largely locked out of supplying network equipment to the U S  because of opposition from U S  lawmakers who allege the company maintains ties to the Chinese authorities and could use its equipment to spy on U S  communications  Huawei has consistently rejected the allegations  Representatives for Huawei did not respond to a request for comment  The SCT already received an unsolicited bid proposal from a group of ex telecoms executives  lawyers and bankers supported by equipment makers Ericsson and Alcatel Lucent  The ministry chose not to accept it in order to keep the competition level  one person said  Accepting it would have meant giving the team an edge in the bidding process  Finland s Nokia and U S  equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc  have also had meetings with the Mexican government about a possible bid  one person said  Spokesmen for the both companies declined comment ,2015-01-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive:-china-telecom-plans-bid-to-build-mexico-broadband-network---sources-323847,323847
216428,437944,CSCO,Apollo to pay more on Presidio amid reputational  credit questions,news,By Lisa Lee  Mike Stone and Mariana Santibanez NEW YORK  Reuters     This story filed on January 22  2015 has been refiled to clarify proposed creditor terms of the Caesars bankruptcy and related quotation   The term debt financing backing Apollo Global Management LLC s  APOLO UL  buyout of information technology services provider Presidio Inc is facing pushback from loan investors wary of an unpopular sponsor  the deal s high leverage and issues related to the credit itself   The  650 million term debt facility has been struggling to attract enough buyers since the deal was launched in early January  people familiar with the planned borrowing said   To entice investors wary of Presidio s lack of hard assets  high leverage and business model  lead arranger Credit Suisse this week made some adjustments to the credit  sources said  Buyer Apollo may also be paying a price for its involvement in restructuring Caesars Entertainment Co  at a time when debt and bondholders stand to face losses on roughly  18 billion of debt    Because Apollo is wiping out the Caesars debt holders  the  debt buyer universe has shrunk  for the Presidio transaction   a source close to the financing said  referring to the hardest hit Caesars creditors   An Apollo spokesperson declined to comment   The sweetened terms will hike Apollo s borrowing costs  but are seen as necessary to get the deal done  The spread over Libor was increased to 525bp from prior guidance of 475bp  the original issue discount slashed to 97 from 99  and the call protection extended to one year from six months   The loans consist of a  600 million seven year term loan and a  50 million revolver  A notes issuance of  400 million also supports the  1 3 billion acquisition   Investors want to be better compensated for the risk taken as the company is increasing its financial leverage to fund the buyout  Apollo s buyout boosts leverage to the mid six times Ebitda range  according to Moody s Investors Service  Loans that cross the six times leverage threshold have been criticized by regulators for overloading on risk  and could potentially lead to penalties for bankers   Investors are also frowning at the IT services outsourcing company  a reseller of other technology company products  low margins  overconcentration on one client  Cisco Systems Inc  49 percent   and lack of hard assets    We passed on Presidio  We dislike the business to begin with and it s too much leverage and no assets   said a loan investor    We just didn t like the credit  We didn t think the current level of performance could be maintained  There is not a big recurring revenue generation   said a second loan investor   The offer of additional yield moved the syndication forward  however  More than 75 percent of the deal has been placed among investors  according to loan market sources  and the transaction is now moving towards closing  There is still some chance for further changes to ensure that the  600 million term loan trades well in the secondary market  they said   Apollo Premium  An important wrinkle for marketing the Presidio loan is the presence of Apollo as the financial sponsor  The private equity firm is in the midst of restructuring of debt burdened Caesars Entertainment Co  and fielding accusations of misappropriating assets at the expense of debt and bondholders    People are hesitant to finance Apollo type deals because the covenants are very weak and they have shown in a number of situations that they will do whatever they can to protect their interests at the expense of bondholders   a bond investor said   Under the Caesars restructuring support agreement  RSA   second lien bond holders would get  0 30 cents on the dollar if they sign up for the restructuring  less if they do not  First lien bond holders would wind up with a recovery valued at  0 938 cents on the dollar and bank lenders would receive a full recovery  The RSA was proposed by Caesars as a voluntary bankruptcy plan and still needs to be approved by the court  Though Caesars s contested bankruptcy is a sharp reminder of Apollo s unpopularity among debt investors  the impact may not put a kibosh on the transaction    Having Apollo involved can be a negative given how they treat debt holders and bond holders   explained the second loan investor   But it s usually not a deal killer    Apollo s unpopularity  paired with credit issues  has increased Apollo s borrowing costs before  In late 2014  the sponsor paid up heavily on a  1 1 billion bond buyout deal for Canadian oil and gas company Jupiter Resources Ltd  Investors cited credit specific issues and Apollo s bad reputation as reasons for their snubbing the transaction   But  particularly given the skimpy primary calendar for new leveraged loans  investors need to put their money to work and do not have the luxury to pass on a deal simply because Apollo is the financial sponsor  several investors said    They really don t have much recourse though  There s always an Apollo premium on things  Investors not liking Apollo is a

216463,437979,CSCO,Weak telecom spending  emerging markets weigh on Cisco forecast,news," Reuters    Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc forecast current quarter profit below analysts  average estimate  weighed down by capital budget cuts at telecom service providers and weak sales in emerging markets 
Cisco s shares reversed course in extended trading following the forecast and fell 1 percent  They had risen after the company reported a better than expected revenue and profit for the first quarter 
 Service provider is the big challenge   that s due to two to three U S  service providers who have dramatically slowed the order rates with us   Chief Executive John Chambers said on a post earnings conference call with analysts 
AT T  the No  2 U S  telecom services provider  said last week that it would trim its 2015 capital spending outlook to  18 billion from  21 billion 
Cisco has also struggled with sluggish sales and increased competition in emerging markets  The company said sales in China fell by a third in the first quarter 
Revenue from U S  service providers dropped 18 percent  while it declined 6 percent in emerging countries  the company said 
The company forecast adjusted profit of between 50 52 cents per share and revenue growth in the range of 4 7 percent for the second quarter ending January 
Analysts were expecting a profit of 53 cents per share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Cisco reported better than expected first quarter revenue and profit  thanks to an increase in demand for its new high end switches and routers

216478,437994,CSCO,Big Tech winning battle with  patent trolls ,news,"By Andrew Chung and Dan Levine   Reuters    For two decades  companies that buy software patents to sue technology giants have been the scourge of Silicon Valley  Reviled as patent trolls  they have attacked everything from Google s online ads to Apple s iPhone features  sometimes winning hundreds of millions of dollars   But now the trolls are in retreat from the tech titans  interviews and data reviewed by Reuters show   In the wake of several changes in U S  law  which make it easier to challenge software patents  patent prices are plummeting  the number of court fights is down  and stock prices of many patent holding companies have fallen  Some tech firms say they are punching up research budgets as legal costs shrink  while support for major patent reform is under fire as trolls get trounced    Their entire business model relies on intimidation  and that has lost its edge   said Efrat Kasznik  president of intellectual property consulting firm Foresight Valuation Group   If the patents are not enforceable in court anymore    the troll has no legs to stand on    Brokers who work with the patent acquisition companies acknowledge the new climate    In some cases  there are just no current buyers for these patents at all   said Robert Aronoff  founder of the patent brokerage Pluritas  citing new legal standards for the change   NetApp  a Silicon Valley maker of sophisticated data storage devices  last month used a new legal precedent to force a patent holder to pay its legal fees  The judge called the case  reckless and wasteful    The new playing field allows NetApp to spend more on developing its own patents  as opposed to litigation defense   It is freeing up dollars   said Douglas Luftman  NetApp s chief intellectual property counsel   To be sure  not all litigious patent owning companies are losing ground  Some with court tested patents are doing well  And not all big tech companies are convinced of the change   Cisco Systems Inc  O CSCO  has been at the forefront of the fight against infringement lawsuits and has not seen a drop in new suits in recent months  said General Counsel Mark Chandler   Cisco will continue to push for laws to stop warrantless lawsuits  Chandler said  Others see the need diminishing   THE BIRTH OF TROLLS  Big tech companies distinguish between their own intellectual property  which they fiercely protect  and those of their adversaries  which they often dismiss as broadly worded and vague  allowing holders to sue all manner of defendants  The big tech companies note that the patent acquisition companies they label as trolls generally make no products but are solely in the business of buying patents and litigating to enforce them   The putative trolls see a different world  They buy patents from inventors and each other  creating a marketplace that checks big tech companies  sway  and rely ultimately on a fair arbiter  courts  This can provide vital protection for investors  ideas  said Matt Vella  CEO of Acacia Research Corp  which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies   I see it as a Robin Hood function   he said   If the so called trolls had a birth date  it would be the summer of 1994  when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time   In the ensuing years  software patents exploded  covering topics from Wi Fi to one click shopping  So did patent lawsuits  Last year  more than 6 000 patent suits were filed  according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina  A 2013 White House report said  trolls  were responsible for 60 percent of suits  up from 29 percent in 2010   Congress struck the first blow against these high volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system  Starting in 2012  companies accused of infringement could ask the U S  Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation  The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court   The reviews proved popular    and devastating for many patent owners  As of June  the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents  claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent  depending on the type of review   Then  in June of this year  the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea    not normally eligible for a patent    does not become patent worthy if run on a computer  That case  Alice vs  CLS Bank  has made it easier still to quash software patents  and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that   MOUNTING EVIDENCE  New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year  to 329 cases  data from Lex Machina show   Defendants are also fighting longer  driving up costs for the acquisition companies  In 2004  the median time it took for a case that didn t settle was 467 days  By 2013  that had reached 673 days  according to Lex Machina   Intellectual Ventures  one of the largest private patent buyers  laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year  The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally  but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round  Intellectual Ventures declined to comment   A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings  found the average price of a patent was  165 000 in the second quarter of 2014  down from  375 000 in 2012   Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules  however  Marathon Patent Group  O MARA  announced last month that the U S  government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent  Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid June   Michael Friedman  managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo  said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM  Microsoft and Qualcomm  are still in a strong position to seek licenses   But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice  the 2014 Supreme Court case  InterDigital  O IDCC  has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp  O ACTG  is down over 9 percent   See graphic     Just three weeks after Alice was decided  an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing  used to sue over 30 tech firms   Acacia is appealing and said that in general  its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way  since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk   
Still  Vella  Acacia s CEO  said  said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy  away from one patent cases to challenges based on several patents     Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington ",2014-10-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/big-tech-winning-battle-with-'patent-trolls'-313870,313870

Complex analysis suggests high volatility  whatever the CPI report

Key Events
Yesterday  a synchronized decline in yields and the US dollar for a third straight day supported a mirror image from equities  a third consecutive advance by US stocks  as investors count the minutes till this morning s release of the US CPI inflation report 
All four major US indices the S P 500  Dow  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 advanced  posting their longest winning streak since January 

The S P 500 climbed 0 26 percent  led by a 0 73 percent bump higher in Real Estate  Energy and Materials were the only two sectors in the red  losing 0 39 percent and 0 25 percent respectively 
Energy stocks were pulled down by seven days of declines in the price of oil within eight days  while the drop in Materials shares may have been led by traders cashing in after the sector s outperformance during Tuesday s session 
Falling Treasury yields slowed the migration of funds out of an erratic equity market into more secure  higher yielding assets  while the weakening dollar simply makes dollar based assets proportionately cheaper 
However  the known fundamental driver of the equity selloff was the sudden realization by investors that rates may go higher  and at a faster pace than anticipated  upsetting complex intermarket and highly leveraged derivative positions and forcing hedge funds to liquidate  dumping more supply all at once than can be handled by demand 
The sudden shift in outlook follows the recent employment report that average hourly earnings rose 2 9 percent YoY  not only more quickly than anticipated  but also at the fastest rate since 2009  Higher wages increase the likelihood that corporates will raise the prices of their goods and services to cover these costs  which in turn spurs inflation  Whereupon the Fed would increase rates to avert the risk that inflation gets out of hand  which ultimately pushes up the cost of borrowing  whose unprecedented affordability has pushed equity prices to record highs 
It thus comes as no surprise that today s CPI reading is likely to be the most watched in a long time  Investors will look for further inflationary signals that could warrant a faster pace of interest rates hikes  or for clues that the previous CPI reading represented an anomaly 
Economists forecast that core CPI  excluding volatile food and energy prices  climbed 1 7 percent YoY in January  compared with 1 8 percent in December  However  from another point of view  inflation may have grown  a 0 2 percent MoM rise in the same indicator  as economists forecast  would result in a three month annualized rate of 2 3 percent  according to analysts at Wells Fargo Securities  That would mark the fastest pace since February 2017 
However  the calculation is more complex  In order to extrapolate inflation projections from CPI data  investors must analyze different aspects of the report  including the unexpected increase in some particular components of the previous monthly report  such as medical goods and cars  Then  they must adjust figures to the assumption that companies tend to hike prices in the beginning of the year  as they test consumer demand  Finally  they need to gauge variations in how data is tracked and whether they have an impact on the projection and how 
After they get through the other side of this labyrinth  they need to formulate an intelligent trading plan  according to the potentially changed economic environment  As we have already experienced  the market narrative on economic figures can change from the time data is released  morphing in the following days and even weeks  Therefore  regardless of what the report actually reveals  there s a good chance that knee jerk reactions  buyer and seller remorse and investors navigating through the maze of figures will result in considerable volatility 
Meanwhile  institutions have raised their stakes in Treasury futures to a record  signaling an expectation that the current bond selloff is not quite over yet  with some  10 year yields will rise to 3 5 percent in the next six months and pricing in a yet steeper pace of Fed tightening  
Global Financial Affairs
This morning  global stocks extended their rebound from the worst two week selloff in two years  with Asian markets taking the lead  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index benefited from surges in Chinese shares listed both on the mainland s Shanghai Composite and on Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index  as well as gains in South Korea s KOSPI and Australia s S P ASX 200 Index 
Japan was the only key market to post a retreat  with shares losing ground both on the TOPIX and the Nikkei 225 

However  declines in the influential Japanese benchmarks were not linked to the recent global selloff but rather to a local situation  the yen soared to a 15 month high  hurting exports and rendering yen denominated shares more expensive via the exchange rate  thus pushing both indices to near 4 month lows 
Stocks in Europe climbed after Germany s GDP rose 0 6 percent in the fourth quarter  as its economy expanded 2 9 percent annually  The report backed the European Commission s claim that the region s expansion is the most balanced since the financial crisis and the IMF s improved global outlook for the year  The region registered its best performance in ten years in 2017  signaling the ECB could soon proceed to reduce its balance sheet 

Curiously  the eurozone s strongly upbeat growth figures did not boost the single currency  which kept falling 

Possibly  that s because US Treasury yields started climbing again 

The dollar  on the other hand  is on the rise  paring a daily loss as it crossed above a downtrend line since Monday 
Ironically  despite a third day of advances for stocks  safe haven assets continued to gain traction  As mentioned above  the yen is set for its strongest close since November 2016  when the dollar fell prior to President Donald Trump becoming  the market s savior  
The Swiss franc and gold are up  Does this signal that investors don t trust equities yet  or are these safe haven categories simply rising on a falling dollar  Treasury yields  normally an indicator for risk aversion  do not currently apply  as buying Treasuries   generally  a bearish indicator for stocks   are now a bullish indicator  as they unwind the very cause of the selloff 

South Africa  rand climbed as the nation awaited President Jacob Zuma s response to his party s request that he resign  As mentioned yesterday  the USD ZAR pair appears to have completed a bearish  Rising Flag  and is falling on the good news 

On Friday JP Morgan Chase sent a note to clients calling the creation of a Bitcoin ETF a  that could become a gamechanger  It would provide easier access to the cryptocurrency  a liquid market and added integrity  since it would be traded through brokerage accounts that carry insurance via SIPC 

WTI crude oil fell below  59  even on a weaker dollar  extending the worst weekly performance for the commodity in two years  on the prospect of rising US supplies

The reality though is the  when few were talking about it and it was emerging out of a Stage 1 base  Now everyone is talking about it and greed has taken over and the Stage 2 uptrend has gone into a breathtaking parabola  Earlier today Bitcoin was more than 130  above it s 30 week MA which is the most overbought it has been since this uptrend began in 2015  Amazingly this is the third time in the last 6 months the price has stretched more than 100  above the MA  that is exceedingly rare for something with a market cap of over  150 billion

QUALCOMM reached a market cap of  100 billion during the same time period which is more similar to Bitcoin but was only able to get 150  above its 30 week MA  which is close to where Bitcoin is currently 

It s impossible to tell where Bitcoin will top  or even if it does move lower from here  whether this area will be  the top   But it s easy to say Bitcoin is the most overextended since this uptrend began because it is  And Bitcoin has no price support in the chart all the way back down to the  3000  4000 area which is more than a 50  loss from here ",2017-11-29,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-buying-panic-leaves-a-dangerously-overextended-market-200269305,200269305

216696,438212,CSCO,Should You Dump Ericsson  ERIC  From Your Portfolio Now ,opinion,A lot has been happening in the network infrastructure and 4G deployment field  and Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   has  no doubt  been quite in the thick of things  Even so  the company has been in a tough spot in recent times  dragged by low investments in mobile broadband and weak demand The beleaguered infrastructure giant s repeated earnings misses  eroding profitability and precipitous revenue decline have left investors high and dry  The stock has lost 21 3  in the past three months  much wider than the  s average decline of 4 7  Most of the company s troubles have stemmed from drying up investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world  Particularly  uncertainty in the financial markets  reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson  The company s revenues and margins in the Networks and IT   Cloud segments continue to take a grave beating from adverse industry trends Further  in the second quarter 2017 earnings report  Ericsson said that it expects a  high single digit percentage  drop in the market for radio access networks this year  which is worse than previously projected  Network equipment sales  particularly in the North America and Europe markets  continue to contract Europe and Latin America   the markets with the biggest impact   are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment in the quarters to come Overall  the company expects the negative industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well We believe the only potential upside to earnings in the near future depends mostly on expense management  Ericsson had earlier announced a restructuring plan to cut costs and streamline the company s focus areas  as well as explore options for the media business  The company now plans to reduce capitalization of its product platform  software release development costs and hardware costs  which could cut operating income for the second half of 2017 by SEK 2 9 billion Ericsson further intends to implement cost savings with an annual run rate effect of at least SEK 10 billion   1 2 billion  by mid 2018  Thus  more restructuring charges are knocking on Ericsson s door and we have a subdued view of operator spending and investments in R D  Currently  it appears the company s savings plans and job reductions are not nearly enough to counter macroeconomic woes and swiftly declining product demand There is also an elevated risk of market and customer project adjustments  which can have a negative impact of SEK 3 5 billion on the operating income in the coming 12 months  In the last quarterly report  Ericsson s CEO warned that an uncertain market could wipe out as much as SEK 5 billion of operating income over the next year Ericsson plans to accelerate its planned cost cuts and scale back expansion plans that aren t moving as anticipated  and refocus on the company s core business of selling networking equipment prior to the anticipated roll out of 5G networks In view of the numerous headwinds  several analysts have downgraded Ericsson since September  as they have a bleak view of the company s revenues and margins  They believe that a rollout of the 5G technology won t provide enough of a boost to the company s revenue base  Investors who are looking for exposure to the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle or Internet of Things might look at players like Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corporation   NYSE NOK   and Cisco Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CSCO   The consensus analyst community is showing no favor toward the stock either  as earnings estimates continue the steep downward trend  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2017 has fallen from earnings of 4 cents to a loss of 1 penny in the past 60 days  dragged by three downward estimate revisions versus none upward Ericsson Price and Consensus   Nevertheless  Ericsson still expects to stabilize its operations amid a difficult market next year and remains hopeful of reaching its targeted operating margin of 12  beyond 2018 Its restructuring plan will help streamline Ericsson s focus areas  improve profitability  and revitalize its technology and market leadership  Ericsson also plans to explore options for the company s media business and review  low performing  contracts in its managed service business Whether these steps will allow Ericsson to jump back on the growth track  remains to be seen  However  as of now  we have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on the stock  as we are deeply concerned over the effect of the restructuring and tough market conditions on the company s profits and share price in the near term Stocks to ConsiderA better ranked stock in the broader sector is Red Hat  Inc    NYSE RHT    carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Red Hat has a robust earnings surprise history  with an average positive surprise of 7   driven by three earnings beats over the trailing four quarters Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana

   Cisco   Arista Feud Turns Nasty Due to CompetitionWe note that Cisco has significantly underperformed Arista on a year to date basis  While the networking giant gained 3   Arista returned 53 6  

Cisco s underperformance reflects the impact of stiff competition it is facing from not only smaller players like Arista and Huawei but also from Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Open Compute Project  OCP  Hence  the lawsuits have significant importance for Cisco  as it looks to regain market share  particularly in the data center networking solutions market  A ban on Arista products surely gives a competitive edge to Cisco The ban on import not only hurts Arista s gross margins  domestic manufacturing costs higher  but also increases lead times to customers due to redesigning of products Robust Portfolio  Edge for AristaWe note that Arista has become a strong challenger to Cisco s dominant position within a short span of time owing to robust portfolio of switches and routers  ably supported by the Extensible Operating System  EOS  EOS s fully programmable and highly modular architecture has been the key differentiator  in our view  Moreover  Arista targets the high end data centers that require fast throughput at low cost  Its high end applications are typically for the cloud data centers  which have better growth prospects as compared with the enterprise data centers Meanwhile  apart from intensifying competition  ongoing transition to subscription based model will continue to hurt Cisco s top line growth at least in the near term  The company recently provided an uninspiring long term outlook  3 5 years  primarily due to these trends Zacks Rank   Key PickCisco has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   while Arista carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   However  TESSCO Technologies   NASDAQ TESS   that sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is a top ranked stock worth watching in the broader sector   You can see Long term EPS growth for TESSCO is currently pegged at 10

216781,438297,CSCO,The Internet Of Things Showdown  Cisco Vs  Sierra Wireless,opinion,"As technology advances  we are becoming more and more interested in the idea of home automation  We feel that it would be great to have the lights turn on at a certain time or even have the blinds automatically go up in the morning  This is called the internet of things and we are only on the tip of the iceberg 
Every year it seems as though there is some new way to automate our lives  While I am not going to get into the advantages and disadvantages of automation in this post  I am going to talk about 2 big players in this space 
Both Cisco and Sierra Wireless are in a position to benefit greatly from the internet of things  But one is a better long term play than the other  Which one is it  Continue reading for the analysis of these two companies 
Overview Of Cisco
Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is a tech stalwart  They were around when the tech bubble burst at the turn of the century  The stock took a beating even then took a long time to recover  But the company is much healthier now and is looking toward the future 
The business of Cisco is manufacturing routers  switches and other software for internet connectivity  Since you need these devices to automate your home  Cisco sees a new income stream on the horizon 
As a result  in 2016 they purchased Jasper Technologies which will help Cisco with processing and analytics of the internet of things 
They have also partnered with the major automakers to provide high speed data transfer networking technology inside the vehicle 
Recently Cisco reported earnings per share of  0 60  which beat estimates by  0 02  Revenues came in at just shy of  12 billion  which beat estimates by  40 million but was a 0 5  decline compared to last year 
The good news is that Cisco knew this revenue drop was coming but is expected to hit upcoming revenue numbers 
As you can see  Cisco is in a good place to take advantage of the internet of things 
Next up is Sierra Wireless 
Overview Of Sierra Wireless
Sierra Wireless Inc   NASDAQ SWIR  is closely related to the business of Cisco  They manufacture 2G  3G and 4G modules and gateways for internet connectivity 
And as with Cisco  Sierra is being proactive in the internet of things space by purchasing smaller firms to cement their position as a top player in the field 
Over the past few years  Sierra has purchased 

AnyData
In Motion
Wireless Maingate
Accel
MobiquiThings
GlobalTop Technology

By making these acquisistions  Sierra Wireless is positioning itself as a pure play internet of things player  who is able to not only allow for network connections  but also analyze  process and gather data 
In its latest earnings report  revenue came in at  161 million  which beat estimates by  6 million and was an increase of 13  compared to the prior year  Earnings per share were  0 24 which beat estimates by  0 08 
For full year 2017 the outlook is good  Revenue is expected to be up 10  and earnings per share up 53  
So just like Cisco  Sierra Wireless is on top of its game when it comes to positioning itself for the internet of things 
The Internet Of Things Showdown
So with two companies poised to profit on the internet of things  which is the better stock to own 
Before I get into that  we need to understand the market size for the internet of things  Cisco estimates it is a  19 billion dollar per year market and Sierra sees over 50 billion connected devices 
Forbes thinks that by 2020  the internet of things market will hit  267 billion by 2020 
So there is money to made here  But are these estimates too rosy  I like to try to look at things from a neutral position before making an investment decision  I agree there is a growing market for the internet of things 
I would love to have my blinds drop based on when the sun is hitting my face when watching television  And the autonomous car is a reality  It might not be the norm in a few years from now  but it is going to happen 
But with that said  I think some aspects of this new technology is more of a fad  I don t see the need to have everything in your house be a smart device 
And I haven t even touched on the issue with privacy concerns  I refuse to have a voice assistant in my house because it is always listening and recording  Sure I m not doing anything illegal  but who knows how that data is being used 
So there is a market for the internet of things  Which stock is better positioned 
Sierra Wireless is setting itself up as a main player in this field with the acquisitions it has been making  As long as the market explodes for this technology  Sierra is going to profit  The only issue is their pricey stock 
With Cisco  they too are positioning themselves well to be a leader in this field  But what I really like about them and why I think they are the better buy is because of diversification 
If the internet of things doesn t live up to the hype or the market crashes  Cisco will be OK  They survived a major market meltdown in the past and they are diversified in many areas of the technology sector should this new industry not live up to the hype

Non GAAP total gross margin and product gross margin were 64 4  and 63 2   respectively  This was a decrease from the prior year period  primarily due to pricing and product mix that was partially offset by continued productivity improvements

216851,438367,CSCO,Cisco  Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio  April 2017,opinion,"Ten new stocks make our Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio this month  which was made available to members on April 20  2017 
Recap from March s Picks
Our Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio   3 3   outperformed the S P 500   0 3   last month  The best performing stocks in the portfolio were large cap stock Tupperware Brands  NYSE TUP   which was up 6  and small cap stock  CBL   Associates Properties  NYSE CBL   which was up 11   Overall  18 out of the 20 Safest Dividend Yields stocks outperformed the S P in March 
The success of the Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio highlights the value of our Robo Analyst technology that scales our forensic accounting expertise  featured in Barron s  across the footnotes in 10 Ks for 3000  companies under coverage  Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality and safer dividend yields because we know they have the cash to support the dividend 
This Model Portfolio only includes stocks that earn an Attractive or Very Attractive rating  have positive free cash flow and economic earnings  and offer a dividend yield greater than 3   We think this combination provides a uniquely well screened group of stocks that can deliver returns greater than the market 
New Stock Feature for April  Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO   33 share 
Cisco Systems  Inc   CSCO  is one of the April additions to our Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio  We first featured CSCO as a top pick back in December 2014  when we highlighted the company s impressive return on invested capital  ROIC  and free cash flow  FCF  generation  Since then  the stock has outperformed the S P 500 on a price  23  vs  15   and total return basis  33  vs  20   
CSCO has a long track record of profit growth and shareholder value creation  Since 1998  Cisco has increased after tax profit  NOPAT  by 13  compounded annually  Over the same period  the company has earned an average ROIC of 15   and Cisco currently earns a top quintile ROIC of 17   The company has improved its NOPAT margin from 17  in 2011 to 21  over the last twelve months  TTM

Free Cash Flow Generation Supports Dividend Growth
CSCO increased its quarterly dividend to  0 29 per share in 1Q17  an increase of nearly 12  year over year  The company has meaningfully increased its payout every year since 2011  when the quarterly dividend was just  0 06 per share  Per Figure 2  these increases represent a 30  compound annual growth rate over the past six years  The growth and sustainability of the dividend is enabled by CSCO s positive free cash flow  FCF  generation  Figure 2 shows how much Cisco s free cash flow exceeds its dividend every year since 2011 except for 2013  Over the same time  CSCO has generated a cumulative  41 billion in FCF  24  of market cap  while paying out just  21 billion in dividends 
Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality dividend yields because we know the firm generates the cash to support its dividend  On the flip side  dividends from companies with low or negative free cash flow cannot be trusted as much because they may be financing the dividend with debt or cash on the balance sheet

CSCO Appears Undervalued in Light of Strong Fundamentals
At the current price of  33 share  CSCO has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 8  This ratio means the market expects CSCO s NOPAT to permanently decline by 20  from current levels  Such expectations seem overly pessimistic given CSCO s position in the growing global IT sector and its long term track record of NOPAT growth 
Even if CSCO never grows profits from current levels  the company s economic book value  or the no growth value of the firm  is  43 share   30  upside from the current valuation 
If CSCO can maintain TTM NOPAT margins  21   and grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  50 share today   52  upside from the current valuation  Meaningful upside potential coupled with CSCO s current 3 5  dividend yield provides investors with an attractive risk reward opportunity

216863,438379,CSCO,Staggering Results Of Trading Options To Profit From The Cloud Revolutio,opinion,"LEDE
What we re going to look at could feel uncomfortable  not in that it s difficult  but rather that it s a glaring example of how the top 0 1  have been dissecting retail traders for decades  But its objective data   this is how option professionals find the edge they require to keep going 
PREFACE
Arista Networks Inc  NYSE ANET  is the young technology company that has burst onto the seen as the first legitimate competitor for Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  and it is rapidly gaining market share in various areas  in particular the high speed data center switching market 

It s these switches and routers that power every computer in every cloud and Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  and Arista Networks Inc  NYSE ANET  are in a brutal competition 
Arista Networks Inc  NYSE ANET 
When trading options we need to answer three critical questions 
  What to trade
  When to trade
  When to close the trade
Arriving at an answer to these questions has had staggering implications  It s also been a disaster for those that have not been prepared 
What to trade  Let s examine selling out of the money puts spread in Arista Networks Inc 
When to trade  Let s now compare examine selling the weekly options versus the monthly options 

Look  while trading partners  pundits or just general social media gurus may belly ache and proclaim that the difference between trading a weekly option 4 times a month or a monthly option once a month is no different   they are wrong and they will cost you money 
It might have felt like a trivial difference   to trade weekly or monthly options   but it isn t trivial at all  Selling a weekly out of the money put spread in ANET over the last two years has returned  44 7  while simply switching to the monthly option has returned 102   It really does matter   and it s different for each stock 
Now that we know the what to trade and the when to trade  we must objectively answer when to close 
Reduce Risk
A short put spread has downside protection but it s one of the most common questions traders have with selling option premium    when do you close the trade  
It turns out that if a put spread was sold for  say  2 00  closing that put spread out once it drops in value to  0 30 has had a large impact on results for Arista Networks Inc  Here s how we account for our limit gain 

And now  the results 

We told you it might feel uncomfortable   the fact that some people have access to this information and others don t 
CONSISTENT
Skepticism is natural   trading isn t a game and that means we have to prove to ourselves that this isn t luck or happen stance 
What we need to do now is look at this short put over various time periods  We see that it has worked over the last two years  now let s look at the last year 

A  29 7  return  when we switched to monthly options and followed a rule of when to close turned into an 81 2  gain 
It s not a magic bullet   it s just easy access to objective data 
Finally  we look at this short put spread over the last six months  these are the results 

WHAT JUST HAPPENED
We don t mean to make you feel uncomfortable  but this is it   the difference between the professionals and the amateurs  This is how people profit from the option market   it s preparation  not luck 
To see how to do this for any stock or ETF and for any strategy  with just the click of a few buttons  we welcome you to watch this 4 minute demonstration video

The dollar was up in early trade on Wednesday  after U S  retail sales and inflation data beat expectations  In the 12 months through January  inflation  as measured by the Consumer Price Index  CPI  rose 2 5  beating expectations of 2 1   
Large gains in energy prices  especially crude oil prices over recent months  were one of the main components  which contributed to a spike in inflation  A separate report showed that U S  retail sales rose 0 4  in January  compared to expectations for a 0 1  increase 
Core retail sales  which exclude automobile sales  increased by 0 8  in January  compared to forecasts for an advance of 0 4  
However  the dollar gave up gains almost immediately  as market focus shifted to a second day of congressional testimony from Fed chief Janet Yellen  who briefly mentioned that the U S  economy was  close to achieving Fed mandates  
For today  the U K  will round up the week with a report on retail sales and Canada is to report figures on foreign securities purchases 
EUR USD
The euro continues to remain under pressure against the stronger dollar on Wednesday  with EUR USD trading flat around  1 0592 in a quiet day for the Euro zone economic calendar

Eurozone manufacturing data will take the center stage next week along with the minutes from the Fed s last meeting 
In addition  markets will continue to watch events in Greece as efforts continue for reaching a deal on the country s next bailout payment before February 20th

Gold
Gold prices gained on Wednesday  in what seems to be a technical rebound  despite positive reports on U S retail sales and inflation  
The yellow metal also seemed to ignore Yellen s hawkish remarks later in the day which favor an interest rate hike sooner than anticipated along with comments by a key Fed policymaker that rates could soon rise going by current economic signals 
Gold fell as low as  1217 50 early in the U S  session and then bounced back up to cross the  1230 level  as the dollar rally faded 
In the coming week  minutes from the Fed s last meeting will be in focus along with developments regarding the Greek bailout  the French and German elections  and the Brexit

Gasoline stocks rose 2 8 million barrels  compared with analysts  expectations in a Reuters poll for a 752 000 barrel drop  That pushed inventories of the fuel to a record at 259 million barrels 
Because of the conflicting price drivers of OPEC s cuts and rising U S  inventories and production  analysts said that prices were largely moving sideways

Higher EPS
From consensus analyst estimates of  11 55 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share  the networking giant reported profits of  2 3 billion for the fiscal second quarter with earnings of 57 cents per share and  11 58 billion in sales  Cisco s revenue declined by 2  compared to last year s same quarter at  11 93 billion to the most recent report of  11 58 in revenue 
Although Cisco s overall revenue rose  its revenue for its Switching business tumbled by 5  compared to the same quarter last year to  3 30 billion narrowly missing analysts  expectations of  3 39 billion 
Along with the release of their earnings report  Cisco also announced that they would boost their quarterly dividend from 26 cents to 29 cents 
Cisco chief financial officer Kelly Kramer stated that the company expects the performance to go on and that they expect the value to be returned to their shareholders  In the statement  she emphasized that the company is pleased with the business transition to software and their recurring revenue progress 
The positive earnings report also impressed investors as the company cut more than 5 000 jobs August last year  which was around 7  of its workforce globally as a part of a restructuring program for Cisco which was a shift to focus the business more on cloud services  security  and internet services 
 We are pleased with the quarter and the continued customer momentum as we help them drive security  automation  and intelligence across the network and into the cloud   said Chuck Robbins  chief executive of Cisco 
Cisco Shares
Although shares of the company rose by 1 58  following the release of the earnings report at  32 82  Cisco shares fell back by 1  to  32 50 during after hours trading on a weaker earnings outlook for the fiscal third quarter at around 57 to 59 cents per share still in line with some analysts estimates at 58 cents EPS 
As the stock declined during after hours trading  analysts became concerned with whether how the company is keeping up with its transitioning and the performance of their computer hardware business which was originally their main source of revenue

Add up the prices per share of all 10 candidates and multiply by 100  That will be the cost to buy 100 shares of each and sell 1 option contract per security  Now take that amount and divide into the cash available  In this example  if we had  300 00 00 cash available we could purchase 300 shares of each stock costing  264 273 00 plus commissions 
Selection process  advanced approach
In this procedure  we calculate the average cash per position  For a portfolio of  300 000 00 and 10 stocks  we would dedicate approximately  30 00 00 per position  Next  we divide the price per share into  30 000 00 and round of to the nearest 100  For example  we would buy 1000 shares of Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO    30 52  and 200 shares of MMM   179 61   Adjustments may need to be made to assure an adequate amount of cash available for potential exit strategy opportunities 
Calculations if we purchased 300 shares of each stock  The Ellman Calculator

Results show initial 5 week premium returns of 1 52  with  returns of an additional 1 99  This creates a scenario with a possible 5 week maximum return of 3 51  which annualizes to 36 5 
Discussion
Option selling can be tailored to one s personal risk tolerance  Using blue chip stocks only as the underlying securities is a conservative approach to covered call writing  Generally  returns will be lower than those from our main premium watch list but still formidable  A secondary benefit is that these securities also offer dividend distributions which can enhance returns even higher

216885,438401,CSCO,Rookies Of The Year  The 4 Most Successful IPOs Of 2016,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
This is Part III of our four part series about how specific groups of stocks repaid investors in 2016  
Part I  Best Comeback Stocks Of 2016  was published right before the Christmas holiday  Part II  SPX MVPs  The 5 Best Performing Stocks of 2016 was published earlier this week  We borrowed our designations from the world of sports  Early next week we ll publish our final installment in the series  a look at the stocks that most disappointed investors  the  draft picks  that turned out to be a bust 
The 2016 Initial Public Offering  IPO  market was not an exciting one by any measure  Following on the heels of 2013  which gave investors the chance to own shares of Twitter  NYSE TWTR   and 2014 when Alibaba  NYSE BABA  made its debut in the markets  and 2015 when high end automotive enthusiasts were finally able to take a stake in Ferrari  NYSE RACE  even if they couldn t afford the car itself  expectations of a splashy IPO during 2016 never materialized  Indeed  our hopes were focused on Snapchat  which it turns out  at least as of this writing  is slated to go public in March 
Unfortunately  we re equally disappointed with the quantity of IPOs that occurred in 2016  The average number of IPOs over the past three years is 284  but this year gave us only 124 IPOs  less than half of the three year average  and the smallest number of IPOs since 2009 
 Courtesy Callum Thomas
There are a few plausible explanations for the slowdown in IPOs  First  the market s abysmal performance at the beginning of this year had a deleterious effect on many companies considering an IPO  as understandably  it s never smart to issue shares when markets are depressed 
Venture capital funds also appear to have a hand in the current situation  It looks like they may be keeping some of their companies private for longer  There are now more  unicorns  doing business than ever before private startups valued at one billion dollars or more  Right now  it is estimated that there are upward of 180 such companies  including Uber and Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi at the top of the list  worth  68 and  46 billion dollars  respectively 
Still  even in a year as dull as this one  there were a few very successful IPOs with returns of over or close to 100  from their first day of trading 
Note that while most publications focus solely on IPO price  we find that metric to be irrelevant for individual investors since the IPO price is reserved for institutional investors who get in on the action earlier than the common investor  who doesn t have access to shares at that early price 
Though we mention the IPO price  we ve calculated returns based on the opening price on each stock s first day of public trading on its respective exchange 


 4  Impinj  Inc 

IPO price   14
Began trading at   18  July 21st 
Current price   35 64
Gain    17 64   98 

Impinj  NASDAQ PI  manufactures referral and information network  RAIN  radio frequency identification  RFID  solutions that provide item intelligence in retail  pharmaceutical  healthcare  food and beverage  and manufacturing and supply chain logistics  The company s platform uses RAIN RFID to wirelessly connect and network everyday items  such as inventory and assets  to software applications  such as enterprise resource planning systems and management systems 
According to its IPO filing  Impinj estimates its market share of the passive RFID tag customer base is about 65   While the world hasn t yet adopted the technology at the rate the company anticipated  if and when the RFID boom occurs  Impinj is set to reap the rewards  Until then  a 30  revenue growth from year to year is a fine accomplishment too 



 3  Merus BV

Began trading at   9 75  May 19th 
Current price   20 97
Gain    10 97   109 

Merus BV  NASDAQ MRUS  is a biotechnology company focusing on oncological treatments  The company has three drugs for breast  colon and ovarian cancer all in clinical trials 
Shares jumped 53  on December 21st  when it was announced that Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  will pay approximately  200 million total to gain access to Merus  research  It has also been agreed that Incyte will fund the development and commercialization of Merus  drugs  in a deal that could potentially be worth  2 8 billion to Merus 


 2  Acacia Communications

IPO price   23
Began trading at   29  May 13th 
Current price   65 90
Gain    36 9   127 

Acacia Communications   NASDAQ ACIA  innovation  optical interconnect products that use special silicon photonic integrated circuits that convert light coming off of fiber optic cable into usable data  While fiber optic technology has been around for a while  Acacia s silicon circuits are more efficient taking up less space and generating more power  thus giving them a technological advantage over older circuits 
Such circuits are used largely by big data center that require ultra fast data transfer  Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  and Huawei  the Chinese networking and telecommunications company  are customers  ACIA s quarterly revenue has grown by 100  year over year for the second quarter in a row  which helps explain the phenomenal growth in share price since the IPO 



 1  AveXis  Inc 

IPO price   20
Began trading at   18 02  February 11th 
Current price   48 59
Gain    30 57   169 

AveXis  NASDAQ AVXS  is a biotech specializing in gene therapy  specifically the company is looking to find genetic treatments for orphan neurological diseases  AVXS is developing a treatment for spinal muscular therapy  SMA  type 1  a disease caused by a genetic defect that leads to the loss of motor neurons  resulting in progressive muscle weakness and paralysis 
The treatment candidate  AVXS 101  is currently in Phase 1 human clinical trials  This past July  the treatment received the FDA s Breakthrough Therapy designation  based on positive clinical trials  This enables the company to fast track the drug s development and testing via the FDA 
Medical research companies are often some of the market s most volatile stocks because there is often little data available on their work coupled with hefty expectations  and thus hit or miss for investors  Shares shoot up on good news and crash on hiccups in the research  It s a similar situation for Merus  mentioned above 
Nonetheless  as long as the probability of AveXis  treatment reaching approval and distribution seems likely  its share price will continue to rise 
Author s Note  A shout out is due as well to ZTO Express  Cayman  Inc  NYSE ZTO   a Chinese delivery firm that raised 1 4 billion dollars and was the biggest IPO of the year  Unfortunately  the biggest IPO was also one of the year s biggest flops  In three short months the company lost a third of its value  falling from  18 40 to  12 31 
An additional honorable mention goes to Twilio  NYSE TWLO   a cloud based communication platform that started trading on June 23rd at  23 99  shot up 195  to  70 96 during late September  only to fall back to earth during Q4 to trade at  30 21

216902,438418,CSCO,What s In Store For Pure Storage  PSTG  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Enterprise data storage firm Pure Storage  Inc    NYSE PSTG   is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2017  ended Oct 2016  results after the market closes on Nov 30  In the last reported quarter  earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 8   Over the trailing four quarters  the company missed earnings estimates twice with an average negative earnings surprise of 5 01  
 Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Key Factors in the Third Quarter   
During the quarter  Pure Storage enhanced its FlashStack Converged Infrastructure Solution by collaborating with Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO     This move facilitates easy deployment  expansion and maintenance of the solution for FlashStack customers  Pure Storage and Cisco have a number of collaborations for various technologies 
While the FlashArray product line addresses structured workloads  FlashBlade has been designed to tackle unstructured workloads  Such collaborations augur well for both the companies but are likely to have a minimal impact on the to be reported quarter s earnings 
The company has also announced the availability of petabyte scale storage utilized for mission critical cloud IT  the next generation of FlashArray  m  This will give its customers a wider range of products to choose from and will enhance the company s sales 
The data storage industry is touted as one of the hi tech industries to watch out for in the coming years and is reportedly on the cusp of a revolutionary change  Storage systems  based entirely on flash chips similar to the ones used in smartphones  are expected to ultimately replace high performance disk drive systems  With cutting edge flash storage technology that is comparatively less expensive  Pure Storage is rapidly gaining traction and is likely to record healthy top and bottom line growth in the to be reported quarter 
The company focuses on research and development  primarily upgrading its existing products  while also developing new ones  These upgradations and innovations  however  come at a high cost  Such costs can be a drag on the company s income in the to be reported quarter PURE STORAGE Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Pure Storage will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is pegged at 0 00  
Zacks Rank  Pure Storage has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of companies which per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Golar LNG Ltd    NASDAQ GLNG   has an Earnings ESP of  7 14  and Zacks Rank  3 
PVH Corp    NYSE PVH   has an Earnings ESP of  0 42  and Zacks Rank  2  You can see

	Chicago  IL   November 16  2016   Stocks in this week s article include Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   NASDAQ     Cardiovascular Systems  NASDAQ     Five9  Inc   NASDAQ     Generac Holdings  NYSE     and Nxstage Medical  NASDAQ      

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin Matras 

Top Stocks with Big Potential Catch up Moves

	Given the recent run up in the market last week  here s a screen I ve been using recently for my own stock picking 

	First  it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries  Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank  1s   2s and  3s  which are Strong Buys  Buys and Holds  respectively  But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks 

	Why would I do something like that 

	Here s why 

	You ve probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group that it s in  And that s true  In fact  oftentimes  even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason 

	Now  take a look at any top group  You ll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there  But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time  Some will move more than others at any given time 

	So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change  you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch up move 

	Here s how to set up that screen 

	  Best Zacks Ranked Sectors    Best 8
	We re screening for only those stocks with the best  lowest  average Zacks Rank  With 16 sectors  the best 8 sectors give us the best 50  of sectors 

	  Best Zacks Ranked Industries    Best 132
	Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru  Since there are 264  X  or expanded industries we look at  the best 132 will give us the best 50  of industries  But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru  If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it s outside of the top sector rank  it will not get thru 

	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2
	Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank  1s   2s  Only Strong Buys and Buys can get through 

	  Price and Avg  Volume greater than or equal to  5 and 100 000 shares
	Only stocks over  5 with at least an average of 100 0000 shares traded daily will be considered 

	  Relative   Price Change    4 Weeks greater than 0
	This means we re screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market  S P 500  over the last 4 weeks 

	    Change in Price    4 Weeks  Bottom 50
	Then finally we re scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks  So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market  they increased in price less than their peers 

	So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector  This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1 

	Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks  you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from 

	And from that list of winners  we re selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list  Remember  these stocks aren t  dogs  or unresponsive stocks  Quite the contrary  they have all outperformed the market  It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list  But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry  we ve singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to  catch up  to the others 

	It s an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names 

	Here are 5 from that list 

	 NASDAQ      Cisco Systems
	 NASDAQ      Cardiovascular Systems
	 NASDAQ      Five9  Inc 
	 NYSE      Generac Holdings
	 NASDAQ      Nxstage Medical

	All great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them 

	Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software

Beat earnings estimates  The company reported earnings of 55 cents per share  topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents per share  This number excludes 9 cents from non recurring items 
Beat revenue estimates  The company saw revenue figures of  12 4 billion  also beating our consensus estimate of  12 342 billion and growing 1  year over year  Product revenue was down 1   and service revenue was up 7   
On a GAAP basis  total gross margin and product gross margin were 63 8  and 63 4   respectively  thanks to productivity improvements and the divestiture of the SP Video CPE Business  which was partially offset by pricing and to a lesser extent product mix  Non GAAP total gross margin and product gross margin were 65 2  and 64 8   respectively 
Looking ahead to Q2  revenue is forecasted to decline  2   to  4   year over year  while GAAP EPS is expected to fall in the range of 42 cents to 47 cents  and non GAAP EPS in the range of 55 cents to 57 cents

216933,438449,CSCO,Cisco Earnings Preview  A Low Bar To Beat,opinion,"Networking equipment giant Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  will deliver its fiscal Q1 earnings results after the closing bell today  Here s a preview of what investors can expect 
Cisco will unveil its results via press release shortly after the market closes at 4 00 pm Eastern  with a 4 30 pm conference call to follow  Typically  the company provides guidance within the press release itself  so the conference call tends to be a non event 
Analysts are expecting Q1 EPS of  0 59  which would be flat from last year  on revenue of  12 33 billion  which would be a 2 7  decrease  Cisco should provide guidance for Q2 as well  and Wall Street is expecting a forecast of  0 59 per share and  12 15 billion for the current period 
Another important metric to key on will be CSCO s gross margins  Last quarter  the company posted non GAAP gross margins of 64 6   up 0 7 percentage points  and product gross margins of 62 9   also up 0 7 points  Meanwhile  service gross margins were 67 0   up 1 1 points 
You wouldn t know it from its share price performance this year  but Cisco has repeatedly said the current operating environment is very challenging  The company sees significant volatility continuing in its geographic markets  which was evident by the fact that in fiscal Q4  revenue in its Service Provider and Emerging Markets segments turned negative  down 5  and 6   respectively  Outside of those two units  however  the remainder of Cisco s businesses saw 5  growth in orders 
Cisco shares fell  0 03   0 08   to  31 67 in Wednesday morning trading  Year to date  CSCO has gained 16 52   more than doubling the return of the benchmark S P 500 index during the same period ",2016-11-16,ETF Daily News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-earnings-preview:-a-low-bar-to-beat-200164999,200164999

216955,438471,CSCO,Top Stocks With Big Potential Catch Up Moves,opinion,"Given the recent run up in the market last week  here s a screen I ve been using recently for my own stock picking  


First  it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries  Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank  1s   2s and  3s  which are Strong Buys  Buys and Holds  respectively  But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks  


Why would I do something like that  


Here s why  


You ve probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group that it s in  And that s true  In fact  oftentimes  even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason  


Now  take a look at any top group  You ll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there  But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time  Some will move more than others at any given time  


So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change  you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch up move  


Here s how to set up that screen  


  Best Zacks Ranked Sectors    Best 8 
We re screening for only those stocks with the best  lowest  average Zacks Rank  With 16 sectors  the best 8 sectors give us the best 50  of sectors  


  Best Zacks Ranked Industries    Best 132 
Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru  Since there are 264  X  or expanded industries we look at  the best 132 will give us the best 50  of industries  But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru  If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it s outside of the top sector rank  it will not get thru  


  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 
Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank  1s   2s  Only Strong Buys and Buys can get through  


  Price and Avg  Volume greater than or equal to  5 and 100 000 shares 
Only stocks over  5 with at least an average of 100 0000 shares traded daily will be considered  


  Relative   Price Change    4 Weeks greater than 0 
This means we re screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market  S P 500  over the last 4 weeks  


    Change in Price    4 Weeks  Bottom 50 
Then finally we re scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks  So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market  they increased in price less than their peers  


So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector  This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1  


Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks  you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from  


And from that list of winners  we re selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list  Remember  these stocks aren t  dogs  or unresponsive stocks  Quite the contrary  they have all outperformed the market  It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list  But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry  we ve singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to  catch up  to the others  


It s an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names  


Here are 5 from that list  

 Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   Cardiovascular Systems  Five9  Inc   Generac Holdings  Nxstage Medical  


All great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them  


Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software

216967,438483,CSCO,What s In The Cards For Five9  FIVN  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Five9 Inc    NASDAQ FIVN   is set to report third quarter 2016 results on Nov 1  Last quarter  the company posted a loss of 7 cents per share  which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents  Moreover  the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the four trailing quarters with an average positive surprise of 29 13  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Five9 offers a virtual contact center cloud platform that acts as a hub for interaction between clients and customers  This facilitates contact center operations focused on inbound or outbound customer interactions within a single unified architecture  The company offers software products such as workforce management  speech recognition  predictive dialer and voice applications 
The cloud based contact center solution industry has been witnessing growth over the past several quarters as organizations are looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support  We believe that Five9 has been capitalizing on this opportunity  which should be reflected in its to be reported quarter 
Furthermore  the company s sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio will aid its top line performance 
However  intensifying competition from small and large players like Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO   is likely to dent Five9 s third quarter performance FIVE9 INC Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Five9 is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the upcoming release  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Five9 is  10 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 11 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 10 cents  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
Zacks Rank  Though Five9 s Zacks Rank  1 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of companies which  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Boyd Gaming Corp    NYSE BYD    with an Earnings ESP of  16 67  and a Zacks Rank  2 You can see  
NVIDIA Corp    NASDAQ NVDA    with an Earnings ESP of  8 93  and a Zacks Rank  3

216981,438497,CSCO,Ericsson s  ERIC  Q3 Earnings In The Red  Shares Tumble,opinion,"Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson  ST ERICAs   publ    NASDAQ ERIC   more than delivered on its profit warning last week for its third quarter 2016 results  as it reported its first loss in nearly four years  Its diluted loss came in at SEK 7  1 penny  in the quarter  compared with earnings of SEK 94 in the prior year period 
The Swedish wireless equipment maker had released ominous preliminary results last week  indicating a huge decline in top line  citing a steadily weakening mobile broadband business and overall adverse industry trends  The news shocked investors and sent the stock plummeting 20  
Ericsson reported non IFRS earnings per share  excluding amortizations  write downs of acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges  of SEK 34  4 cents  for the quarter  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents by a whopping 55 6   The bottom line fared even worse in year over year comparison  having fallen a colossal 75  from the prior year tally of SEK 1 34 
Investors were terribly disappointed with the top  and bottom line miss  Ericsson s shares were trending down significantly in pre market trading  falling 4 3  at one point 
This is the third consecutive earnings miss for the Swedish giant  Ericsson missed earnings by nearly 29  in second quarter 2016 
The decline in bottom line can be attributed to the consistent weak product demand  which gave rise to weakness across the company s segments  Also  negative revaluation effects of currency hedge contracts and restructuring charges put further pressure on earnings 
Inside the Headlines
Revenues continued their downward spiral and fell 14  year over year to SEK 51 1 billion   6 billion  for the quarter  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 5 billion 
Sluggish growth in emerging markets like Brazil  Russia  and the Middle East  completion of major projects in European markets and adverse currency translation hampered revenues  Other broader negative trends from the first half of the year accelerated as well  particularly impacting Networks segment 
The decline in sales was all pervasive  with all three operating segments of the company charting negative revenue growth 
Segmental Performance
On a segmental basis  Networks revenues were down 19  year over year to SEK 23 3 billion   2 7 billion   Markets with a weak macro environment recorded softness in both mobile broadband coverage and capacity sales  Delayed spectrum auction in India and lower 3G sales in China proved to be drag on sales in this segment 
Also  lack of revenues on account of completion of major European mobile broadband projects in 2015 compounded the segment s problems  However  rapid 4G deployment in China  along with strong core networks sales compensated the decline to some extent 
Global Services revenues fell 8  year over year to SEK 24 8 billion   2 9 billion   Continued decline in Network Rollout sales and tepid professional services performance led to the unimpressive sales 
Support Solutions revenues also went down 11  year over year to SEK 2 9 billion   340 million   dragged primarily by lower software licensing sales in transformation projects 
Ericsson s gross margin  excluding restructuring charges  in the quarter contracted 560 basis points year over year to 28 3  The company s efforts to curb costs failed to offset the diminishing sales and thus  the company s margins contracted sharply  A bigger share of lower margin business like services business  along with lower sales in Networks and mobile broadband businesses  contributed to the compressed margins 
The decline in Ericsson s operating margin  excluding restructuring charges  was even more pronounced  plummeting 790 basis points on a year over year basis to 0 7   The effect of lower gross margin trickled down to operating margins  with higher R D expenses further contracting it 
Three Pronged Growth Plan
Ericsson is presently following a three pronged strategy to drive growth  The first strategic area is  core business growth   in which the company is focusing on deployment of 4G and promotion of 5G  The company constantly seeks to seize business opportunities as operators shift toward 4G deployment and prepare grounds for the forthcoming 5G revolution 
The second area of focus  which is to improve profitability in the targeted growth areas  is witnessing the company concentrate on  software sales  and  recurring businesses  to drive growth in its thriving Professional Services 
The final growth area is  cost and efficiency program  that has been devised to generate higher cost savings  In fact  to adapt to and counteract the lower demand for mobile broadband investments  Ericsson has mapped a set of significant actions to boost efficiency and cut costs further 
The formerly announced cost and efficiency program  through which Ericsson intends to unlock savings of SEK 9 billion in 2017  is moving ahead per the plan  Ericsson further revealed plans to reduce cost of sales  in order to adapt operations to weaker mobile broadband demand  The company plans to reduce the annual run rate of operating expenses  excluding restructuring charges  to SEK 53 billion in the second half of 2017  through these initiatives  This is comparable to SEK 63 billion in 2014  and equates to double the amount of savings in operating expenses that was previously targeted 
Liquidity
During the quarter  cash utilized in operating activities came to SEK 2 3 billion   270 million   compared with cash generated from operating activities of SEK 1 6 billion at the end of third quarter 2015 
Ericsson s cash and cash equivalents as on Sep 30  2016 totaled SEK 24 4 billion   2 9 billion   compared with SEK 34 billion a year back 
Changes in Company Structure
In first quarter 2016  Ericsson announced a set of structural changes to improve strategy execution and drive efficiency  The company plans to design five business units and one dedicated customer group for Industry   Society  in line with its three pronged growth strategy  With these changes  Ericsson believes that it will be better equipped to cater to the needs of multiple customer segments and leverage on market opportunities to drive faster growth 
To Conclude
Ericsson has been grappling with an industry wide slump in demand and fierce competition from China has further exacerbated this cyclical downturn  Investors have steadily lost faith in this company  which has tanked 49  over the past year 
ERICSSON LM ADR Price and EPS Surprise
 
   Ericsson is contending with stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp    NYSE NOK    Slumping demand in Russia and Brazil  and accelerating negative industry trends have further compounded its problems  Slowing pace of telecom industry  upgrades to 4G standards  and consequent lower spending from clients like Vodafone  LON VOD  and Verizon have battered Ericsson s prospects 
To combat such critical industry concerns  Ericsson recently struck a partnership with Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    to boost its product lineup and sell more complete networks  The company expects that the deal would generate  1 billion or more in annual sales for each company by 2018 
The company is also taking internal steps to stabilize its operations somewhat  It has plans to reduce its operating expenses by 10 billion kronor by 2017 compared with 2014  However  the company has acknowledged that its savings plans and job reductions do not seem enough to weather the swiftly declining demand 
Whether the growth and cost streamlining efforts of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company will help it beat industry wide demand blues  remains to be seen 
InterDigital  Inc    NASDAQ IDCC   develops and markets advanced digital wireless telecommunications systems  using proprietary technologies for voice and data communications  The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has an excellent earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters  beating estimates all through  with a robust average positive surprise of 82 4   You can see  
Note  SEK 1    0 1172  Period average from Jul 1  2016   Sep 30  2016

217016,438532,CSCO,Cisco Prices  6 25B Senior Notes  Rated A1 By Moody s,opinion,"Shares of Cisco Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CSCO   have been scaling steadily higher over the last 12 months  The company s stock provided a return of 19 2  as compared to the S P 500 s 6 7  over the period 
The upside can be primarily attributed to the company s strong market position  a wide product range  initiatives for growth  new investments and dividend payout  Moreover  a gradual shift towards cloud computing and increasing data flow on computer networks are further helping the stock climb higher  However  on the flip side  Chinese competition remains a matter of concern for the company 
Cisco has recently announced the pricing of senior unsecured notes aggregating  6 25 billion  These bonds have been issued in five tranches of different amounts with varying coupon rates and maturity dates  The offering is expected to close on Sep 20  2016  subject to customary closing conditions 
Out of these notes   500 million  carrying an interest at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 34 basis points  will mature in 2019  Senior Notes worth  1 5 billion   2 billion  and  750 million  with annualized interest rate of 1 400   1 850  and 2 200   are due to mature in 2019  2021 and 2023 respectively 
Additionally  another  1 5 billion worth of senior notes having an annualized interest rate of 2 500  will mature in 2026 
Management intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  These may include share repurchases  debt repayment  including the repayment of previously issued senior unsecured notes  acquisitions  investments  additions to working capital  capital expenditures  cash dividends or investments in its subsidiaries 
Moody s Rating
Moody s Investor Services   the credit rating agency of Moody s Corporation   assigned an  A1  rating to the Notes  The A1 rating carries a stable outlook 
The rating was based on the Internet protocol  IP  provider s strength in network equipment domain aided by its broad and innovative product line  expansive operations and distribution  end to end networking capabilities and advanced technology development abilities  Despite intensifying competition from several smaller players  these key points helped the company to sustain its market share 
In addition  the company s strong footing in the networking space  cost efficiency and a sturdy balance sheet influenced the rating  The company has around  66 billion in cash and highly liquid investments 
The company maintains strong liquidity and has moderate financial leverage  This enables the company to return value to shareholders through regular share repurchases and dividend payouts  Moreover  it allows the company to invest aggressively to expand its core business and effectively deal with competitive challenges 
Technically Speaking

As we can see from the Daily chart of Cisco above  price has broken out of a Rising Wedge pattern to the downside  along with a Negative Divergence with the 14 period Money Flow Index  wherein price is making higher highs but the oscillator is making lower highs indicating that volume is drying up on the way up  This indicates that the stock lacks the energy to go higher in the short term and a reversal is very likely 
In the short term  the stock may fall further to take support at the  27 level

This stock lost over 90  of its peak value from the dot com days  making a low in late 2002  And frankly  since then it has not done much of anything  For 14 years  That is a whole lot of nothing  Recent activity  though  has the stock poised for a possible major move higher  The monthly chart below tells the story 

This chart shows a tightening consolidation around a mid point at about 25  Since bouncing off of the bottom of the consolidation zone in late 2012  it has trended higher  Now as it starts September  it s at the top of the triangle  It has support for continued upward price action from the rising and bullish MACD and a RSI in the bullish zone and rising 
Prices To Watch
If the price continues higher    and over the triangle    there are a few price levels to watch that would add increasing confidence of a large move higher  The first is a break of the triangle at about 32  Next is 33 15  This would be a move over the high bump in the chart from 2007  The third is 36 38  This is a 38 2  retracement of the move lower from the dot com crash  A break over that 38 2  level and close on a monthly basis would then present a target move to either the 50  or 61 8  level  That s the major move

217044,438560,CSCO,Gold On A Leash Through These Dog Days,opinion,"Has anyone noticed that gold through these  Dog Days of August  has been on a fairly tight leash  almost as if reined in by the S P 500 such that both markets from one month ago to date have netted at best a mild 1  uprise   the S P s lacking earnings otherwise  
You know you re in these so called  Dog Days  when  given the significant and far too oft horrific events which have befallen the globe this past year  the lead StateSide story of late has something to do with swimmers  mis escapades at the summer games down Rio way  Not unusually  the August air has become ripe with complacency  Gold and the S P traipsing along together as if hand in hand on the summer s final happy walk along the creek and up to the waterfall before  tis back to reality  the city and the school bus  Here are the two markets  percentage tracks over the last 21 trading days  one month   for which Gold is  1 0  and the S P  0 7  

To be sure  our  expect daily trading ranges   EDTRs  have been narrowing near nothing as we next see for both Gold and the S P from one year ago to date  again these are not price tracks  rather our expectations of prices  day to day differences between their highs and lows  A little summertime  how low can you limbo  goin  on out there  after the stormier  yet Gold positive turbulence we endured across these markets back from mid June into early July 


 Course  as goes the classic Neil Young piece from  77  You are like a hurricane  there s calm in your eye      And you know how Septembers tend to go   Hey Egbert  I just saw Mabel the cat fly past the window     In fact  three of the past five Septembers have been net down for the S P  as have four of them been for Gold  Still  we ve a week and a half to mull over what may befall or befriend Gold next month  with price presently  26 9  year to date at 1346   and having been up as much as 29 9  upon reaching our targeted year to date high at Base Camp 1377 on 06 July    tis fair to say the year s trend is up  what  Moreover  during the 10 year run from 2001 2010  Gold suffered but one net negative September   a 4 6  loss in 2006   We look forward to further assessing the Then 
As for the Now  here we ve Gold s weekly bars  their having run out of puff through these Dog Days  with this third consecutive week having closed near its low   which for you technician types out there is  three hammers in a row     Tis also the third straight week wherein the net change has been less than one percent  Yes  the sleeping dog may now lie low  but in a month s time be back on the go   tis the direction we wish to know  the trend being that Gold ought grow 


 But  mmb  the economy s not lying low  the July LEI was  0 4   which you said it wouldn t be  huh  

Well  Squire  you ve called me out on that one  Indeed in last week s missive we stated that the Conference Board s July reading of their Leading Indicators   oft called the  LEI  for  leading economic indicators    wouldn t grow by the  0 4  consensus expectation  But it did  Yet if we go  inside the numbers  via the Economic Barometer  metrics related to July as below shown make up the purple portion of the Econ Baro s line  With due respect to the Conference Board  does that purple bit look like  0 4  growth to you 

Ought we thus be concerned   duh   Take that   0 4  growth   plus the stock market making a marginal new high as most days go by  and the motto of the Alfred E  Neuman Institute for Common Knowledge stands firm   What  me worry   Brings to mind this graphic with which you veteran Gold Update readers are familiar 
Still  according to Reuters   US inflation tame despite economy gaining momentum   It is  Rather  we ask  is the first economic domino in the course of being tipped  A CNN piece this past week alerted us that  Global Central Banks  are  Dumping American Debt At A Record Pace  That s cute   Course  taking the other side of the trade is  private demand  in the chase to grab some  safe  yield whilst  tis still positive  barely   the 10 year U S  Treasury Note as of yesterday s  Friday s  settle is yielding 1 578   Want more  They re those equity funds for emerging markets which reportedly just hit a 58 week high  Nuthin  like  safety in numbers   eh  Sheesh 
Irrespective of whether the first domino to fall is Debt  or Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   or the Dollar    the latter having lost ground in seven of the last 10 trading days due to a  faltering economy   thank you Bloomy     there then would fall the second domino  Might it be higher unemployment  We read that Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is to let go some 14 000 folks  Or earnings becoming weaker still  Amidst all the apparently robust housing news we find that home improvement and appliance supplier Lowe s is cutting its profit outlook  indeed with Q2 Earnings Season now concluded  for the 2 500  companies collected  only 55  improved over 2015 s Q2   our  live  reading of the S P s price earnings ratio still at a staggeringly high 38 0x   What about our foreign friends  Stocks across the pond  as measured by the STOXX 600  just put in their worst week in two months  rents in London are actually falling  some UK savers  rates are being halved  thank you Santander  MC SAN  and Brexit banking instability   whilst further  round the world  Japan s Q2 gross domestic product disappointingly stalled   poor ole able Abe  
All that said  thank goodness there s Gold  Where would we end up without it  The problem is  of course  most folks are without it  As for  Where is it    we next turn to the following two panel display of Gold s daily bars for the past three months on the left  and the 10 day Market Profile on the right  The baby blue dots   our day by day measure of 21 day linear regression trend consistency   are making a somewhat daunting dip rather than returning back up above their  80  level  again  having now had three weeks in a row  per the above weekly bars  of Gold giving up its intra week gains lends to a negative technical bent  at least near term  And in the profile  you can see the overhead trading resistors depicted at 1348  1352 and 1358 

The panels are similar for Sister Silver  her  Baby Blues   left  having just abruptly blown below their 0  neutral level  whilst in her profile  right  the 19 75 level appears as stark overhead resistance 

So although Gold going forward is nothing but fundamentally fantastic  the near term    strictly technical read    is mildly bearish  The same can be said for Silver  albeit as you know  she has a hankerin  of getting torn down away from Gold should Cousin Copper struggle in his industrial metal fettle 
Now let s wrap this week s missive with a bit of Golden Glitter  Apropos of having opened this piece with mention of Rio s Olympic Games  we spent this past mid week up in Olympic Valley  site of Squaw Valley s 1960 Winter Olympics  And obviously in traveling from here  San Francisco  to there  we traversed California s Gold Country  wherein we were most highly privileged to have been afforded a private tour of a high security Gold stash deep in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains  Securitized by floor weighting sensors  invisible beams  atomic air particle measurements  all surrounded by guards and four legged critters with whom you d rather not have to face as foe  your accidentally breaking wind at either end in this place will set off alarms aplenty  even in the Governor s bedroom many miles westward down in the valley  Yet by their risking it all to give us a peek as a professional perk  we were actually allowed to take the following photograph   even upon our first warning them that thousands of readers would see it   Behold Real Gold  some 200 troy ounces within a frame not even one meter square  And when you do the math  don t forget to add in almost two centuries of collectible value as well 
Fairly inspirational stuff  that  So if you re one of the 99  without it  then get with it  Unleash yourself and go buy some Gold ",2016-08-21,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-on-a-leash-through-these-dog-days-200149150,200149150

The weekly chart of Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   shares shows the stock still has not managed to recover from the Dot com crash in 2000 2002  Currently trading slightly above 31 dollars a share  it is not even close to the pre crash levels  But what is even more worrying is the fact that the entire price development since the top in March  2000  looks like an almost complete 5 3 wave cycle  A five wave  from 82 00 all the way down to 8 12 in October  2002  followed by a three wave W X Y correction  whose wave Y is still in progress  According to the   impulses show the direction of the larger trend  As soon as the following correction is over  the trend resumes in the direction of the five wave sequence 
In Cisco s case this means that once wave Y end  another significant sell off is likely  Correction usually develop between the parallel lines of a corrective channel  We believe Cisco stock would probably reach the upper line of the above shown channel  around 40 dollars a share  Despite the extreme optimism this new multi year high would arouse in investors  owning Cisco shares could turn into a costly mistake  because once the downtrend resumes  prices below 8 dollars a share should not be surprising  When such low levels are reached  a company s very existence is under threat  Only time will tell if Cisco is going to survive through the next market meltdown  but it definitely does not look like your best long term investment right now ",2016-08-08,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-might-not-survive-another-crisis-200146634,200146634

217162,438678,CSCO,Retired Investors  Give This Blue Chip Technology Stalwart A Close Look,opinion,"Introduction
I believe that building and managing a successful stock portfolio is simple and straightforward  but not necessarily easy  Building and successfully managing a portfolio of individual stocks requires work  a disciplined philosophy and a reasonable commitment of time  But perhaps most importantly  it s critical to start out with a precise understanding and acceptance of how you approach the investing process 
You can either behave as a prudent long term investor or as an active trader  The differences between these two approaches are not subtle   they are vast  Unfortunately  at least in my personal experience  there are many well intentioned people that feel they would be most comfortable with the prudent long term investor approach  but cannot resist the seduction of stock price volatility  No matter how hard these investors try  they cannot ignore the daily ups and downs of stock price movements 
As one Morningstar writer I once read so aptly put it   Given the proclivity of Mr  Market to plead temporary insanity at the drop of a hat  we strongly believe that it s not worth devoting any time to predicting its actions   Stated more directly  in the short run  stock price movements are often irrational and consequently unpredictable  Later I will provide a clear example supporting the veracity of that statement  Nevertheless  there are many active traders that believe they have an edge  however  I ve yet to have anyone convince me that they in truth and fact do 
This brings me to the primary difference between the mindsets and perspectives of active traders versus long term investors  Active traders tend to primarily be stock price focused  In their world  everything is about whether the price of the stock is rising or falling  A stock with a falling stock price is a bad stock  where a stock with a rising stock price is a good stock  Active traders possess more of a casino like mentality and as such have little or no regard or concern about fundamentals or business values 
Ironically  the active trading approach requires more time  energy and effort than does a more prudent long term approach  In other words  active trading essentially turns investing into a full time job  Consequently  I contend that this approach is not appropriate for most people  Most of us have more important things to do with our lives and time than sitting in front of a computer screen obsessively tracking stock prices 
In contrast  long term investing implies focusing more on the business you are invested in with little or even no concern about short term price volatility  Instead of focusing on price movements  the focus is on the company s financial performance and fundamental strengths  Prudent long term investors understand that in the long run it s the success of the business that truly matters most  These investors recognize and understand that buying a stock represents becoming a part owner in a business 
Personally  when I invest in a stock as a passive shareholder owner  I am not interested in running the business  I leave that work to the management team  The only work I m interested in is having my money working for me  As a minority shareholder  I am keenly interested in how the company is doing and only mildly interested in its short term stock price movements  This is especially relevant when I have a clear understanding of what the business is worth  Therefore  if or when short term market price drops below that level  I never assume I m losing money  Especially if the business I own is continuing to perform as expected  Instead  I simply consider the business temporarily illiquid 
Therefore  if I did need to raise money  for example  in an emergency  I would look to other stocks I might own that the market was either valuing correctly or overvaluing  My point is that I don t consider it intelligent to sell an asset for less than I believe it is worth  This type of business owner s mindset goes a long way towards keeping emotion out of the investing equation  I draw my confidence from the strength and health of the business I own which keeps me from panicking during periods of high market volatility 
I have chosen the business below because I believe it is attractively valued and because it offers a high yield in today s low interest rate environment  However  this particular business also offers important insights and represents a quintessential example of the principles I have been discussing in this introduction  In other words  not only do I consider it an excellent investment at this time  I also feel it offers vitally important investing lessons  I intend to elaborate on both as I review Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  below 
Quintessential Lessons in Long Term Investing
It is a commonly held view that technology companies are cyclical stocks  To a great extent  this is true  However  just because a business operates in the Technology Sector does not simultaneously suggest that it is a highly cyclical business  Cisco is a case in point  A quick review of the following earnings and dividends only  on Cisco suggests that this technology bellwether looks more like a growth stock than a cyclical stock  Business did falter a little bit during our last two recessions  but neither case suggests deep cyclicality 
On the other hand  since fiscal 1997 earnings growth has averaged over 13  per annum and the company initiated a dividend at the beginning of fiscal year 2011  The honeydew green line  white  plots the company s dividends per share  and the area below the line represents the portion of earnings they paid out  commonly known as the dividend payout ratio  The light green shaded area shows the same dividends after they have been paid out  This graph illustrates our first look at Cisco the business 
When looked at from this business perspective  I see very consistent and strong long term business performance  Additionally  a review of the FAST FACTS boxes to the right provides additional initial insights into the quality of this business  I like the low debt to capital ratio of 25   I like the AA  S P credit rating and I like the dividend yield of 3 9   I also like the growth of the company s dividend since they started paying one in 2011  From what I see here  Cisco represents exactly the kind of business that I would like to be the owner of  Importantly  there are no stock prices to contaminate my thinking or engender emotional responses 

When I am initially examining a business for prospective investment  I start out by reviewing its long term earnings performance as I did with Cisco above  Next  I like to also look at its historical cash flow generating performance  Examining cash flows is even more relevant when I am evaluating a dividend paying stock  Clearly Cisco is more than adequately covering its current dividends with strong cash flows 

Investing in the Business
At this point  I consider Cisco a further research worthy candidate because I like what I see regarding my first look at the business behind Cisco s stock 
 Note  before I would actually consider a stock  research worthy  it would also have to be available to me at an attractive valuation  Cisco currently meets my valuation criteria  However  this can only be determined by including stock price into the equation  In the context of this article s secondary objective of presenting time tested lessons in investing  I have chosen to save stock price inclusion for later when I delve deeper into valuation principles  
Nevertheless  Cisco s consistent and impressive long term operating record motivates me to want to look deeper under the hood  Of course  this implies diving into the company s financial statements 
The first metric I like to examine in the financial statements are revenues  Bottom line results like earnings must start and come from the top line  Additionally  accounting conventions coupled with financial engineering could possibly paint a rosier earnings picture than is deserved  whereas top line results clearly illustrate whether a business is truly growing or not  I like to look at revenues from two perspectives  First I examine gross revenues in dollars  Cisco s long term revenue growth has been impressive as depicted below 

However  since I am also a passive shareholder  I also like to look at revenues per share  Revenues per share can be impacted by what some call financial engineering in the form of share buybacks  On the other hand  as I will later illustrate  share buybacks can be a positive or a negative depending on the company s stock valuation at the time and or whether or not the company has a good use or need of its cash to fund future growth  Cisco s revenue per share record is just as impressive as its gross revenues 

After reviewing a company s top line  I like to turn my attention to profitability  At this point I am interested in determining how much profitability the company generates per dollar of sales  To evaluate this  I look at gross profit margins compared to net profit margins  Cisco generates very high gross profit margins which I consider a plus  My personal benchmark for net profit margin is 15  or better  Cisco has consistently produced net profit margins exceeding that benchmark  I like businesses with high net profit margins 

After I have reviewed profit margins  I typically turn to analyzing return on equity  As a shareholder  I consider this metric important because it essentially measures the return the company is earning on shareholder money  I am quite comfortable when I see a return on equity of 10  or better  Cisco earns returns on equity above this threshold  One caveat regarding return on equity is that companies can boost it by taking on more debt  Consequently  I put more weight on this metric when debt levels are reasonable   as is the case with Cisco 

Thus far I ve illustrated some of the go to metrics that I like to look at when evaluating the strength and health of a business I might be interested in investing in  However  I don t stop here  Additionally  I thoroughly examine the company s balance sheet  cash flow statement and income statement  These financial items are available from numerous sources  Personally  I utilize F A S T  Graphs  and FUN Graphs  fundamental underlying numbers  to facilitate a deeper look into the company s financials 
Bonus  for readers that are interested  I offer the and set of FUN Graphs on Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   
I typically start out by examining all of the metrics together on the company s balance sheet  cash flow statement and income statement  Here is a sample of Cisco Systems  balance sheet which includes assets per share  atps   cash per share  cashps   common equity per share  ceps  also known as book value  debt long term per share  dltps   debt to total per share  dtps  and invested capital per share  icaptps  

Additionally  I will look at each metric on the balance sheet one at a time in order to focus more clearly on each metric  Here s an example of Cisco s cash  Clearly  Cisco possesses significant financial resources and flexibility 

Learning About The Business
Once I have thoroughly examined a company s financial results  health and strength  I typically turn my attention to learning as much as I can about what the company does and how they make their money  The easiest way to do that is to simply follow the link on my F A S T  Graphs  to the company s website  Although I recognize that much of what I will find will be company propaganda spun as positively as they can  I can also learn a lot about the company s products and various business enterprises  Here is a snapshot from Cisco s website illustrating key product areas with specific links to each  If I m seriously interested in investing in the company  I will peruse each of those links 


I will usually then go to the company s investor services sections and look for presentations that the company has recently presented  Here is an example of an informative slide from Cisco s Q2 Fiscal Year 2016 Conference Call 

But  my favorite places to learn about the company s businesses are by reading the compay s 10 Ks and 10 Qs  As I previously stated  researching a stock is simple and straightforward  However  I also stated that it requires time and effort  Consequently  I will usually not go to this extent with my research process unless I am very confident that I am examining an attractive potential investment 
Cisco Systems  Inc   Quintessential Lessons on Valuation
In the introduction to this article I suggested that stock price movements are often irrational and consequently unpredictable  Furthermore  I promised that I would present a clear example supporting the veracity of that statement  The stock market s long term valuation history on Cisco Systems provides compelling evidence supporting just how irrational the stock market can be at times 
In the late 1990s Cisco Systems  along with several other bellwether technology stocks  were being valued at ridiculous valuations  see the red circle on the graph   At its peak  Cisco was being valued at over 160 times earnings and for a time had one of the largest market caps of any company on the earth  However  this was an irrational valuation because Cisco s fundamentals clearly did not support such a ridiculously high level  In other words  Cisco s business was worth nowhere near what the market was valuing it at 
Remember  I also earlier stated that it s the value of the business that truly matters in the long run  Therefore  the subsequent fall from grace of Cisco s stock price in calendar years 2000 and 2001 presents striking evidence of that reality  But we must also recognize that just as the market can irrationally overvalue a business  it can also be just as irrational with undervaluing a business 
It is my contention that this is precisely what has been happening with Cisco s stock price since the beginning of 2010  see the green circle on the graph   Consequently  my primary investment thesis for suggesting Cisco is based on what I consider to be significant current undervaluation by the market  A blended P E ratio below 12 and a dividend yield of approximately 3 9  with the opportunity to grow seems compelling to me considering Cisco s quality and financial health as described above  However  prudence might dictate waiting until the company reports 3rd quarter results on May 18 

One additional comment regarding Cisco  its recent performance and valuation  is to point out that in spite of this  the company has outperformed the S P 500 since it initiated its first dividend in fiscal 2011  The following earnings and price correlated graph with performance calculations illustrates how attractive Cisco has been over this timeframe 

Earnings and price are not the only valuation metrics I like to examine  Cisco also looks very attractively valued based on its current price to book  pb  and price to sales  ps  

Management
One final but extremely important element involved in thoroughly researching a company is analyzing the company s management team  In my personal opinion  the capability of Cisco s management team has been historically much maligned providing further evidence of irrational investor behavior  This especially relates to former CEO John Chambers  Over the years I have read many scathing criticisms of his lack of skills of running Cisco  Yet the very first graph I presented in this article clearly supports the undeniable fact that John Chambers did a great job running the business 
The company s earnings growth under his reign has been nothing short of spectacular  On the other hand  the irrational way that the market has been pricing the stock was simply beyond management s control  Management can grow the business  but they have no control over how the market will price the stock  John Chambers has recently stepped down as CEO but remains executive chairman 
I offer the following graphical comparison to illustrate the competency of Cisco s management team and their stewardship since fiscal year 1997  Earlier I discussed the potential impact of financial engineering on earnings relating to share buybacks  The comparison of the following two graphs illustrate that Cisco s management was prudently issuing shares when valuations were high  above the orange line  and excessive  In contrast  this also illustrates how management has been prudently buying back shares recently when valuation of the stock was low  on or below the orange line  

Summary and Conclusions
I am a firm believer and aligned with legendary investor Warren Buffett who said  investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike   Prudent long term investors are most interested in positioning themselves as long term shareholder owners or partners in excellent businesses  At the same time  they recognize that in the long run  business results matter most  When you are investing as an owner  you go in with the intention of owning the investment for a long period of time  Consequently  you spend most of your effort and energy focusing on business results and very little worrying about day to day price volatility 
I believe that most people intuitively understand and even embrace the time tested principles of investing as business owners  However  I also recognize that the relentless siren song of stock price volatility in the short run can be very unnerving  Nevertheless  if long term investing success is truly your goal  then I believe it s imperative that you learn to trust business results more than short run price action

217163,438679,CSCO,The Week Ahead  Springtime For Housing ,opinion,"This week s economic calendar includes some key data on the housing market and few other major reports  The debate about the strength of the U S  economy continues  The housing market is an important contributor to the economy  As we enter the key season for real estate many will be asking 
Is it Springtime for housing  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted that there would be special attention to the mixed message of economic reports  contrasting the relative strength of employment with other data  That was a major theme  Some insisted that the employment was overstated  Others said it was a lagging indicator  A few mentioned that GDP was probably understated  Friday s relatively strong data continued the mixed message  I also suggested that the political sideshow would grab attention  but that was obvious 
Once again the early strength faded at the end of the week  Doug Short captures the story of the decline  the third straight  with his excellent weekly chart   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

The  adds more analysis on the major themes as well as a multi year context 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
The economic calendar has mostly secondary reports again this week  Friday s stronger economic data only intensified the debate  as the market reacted negatively  This week features three important housing reports and two of lesser significance  Since springtime brings higher expectations for this sector  I expect more attention than usual  The punditry will be asking 
Is it Springtime for Housing  
Background 
Attention focuses on housing with some frequency since it is important to the economy  Wells Fargo  that residential investment rose 14 8  in the past year  contributing 0 5  to the Q1 GDP growth  which coincidentally was 0 5    Last year the National Association of Homebuilders  that housing was over 15  of GDP  The impact is not just home sales  but also remodeling 

Viewpoints 
The basic themes  moving from bearish to bullish on stocks are as follows 
The real estate market is about to crash    
  Didn t we learn anything 
Increasing housing prices strain the affordability for new buyers  prices are too high  
 do not have  
Homes held in foreclosure proceedings or by speculators provide low priced competition   Whoops  That one changed  
Home sales are low because there is insufficient supply  the new version  
Interest rates remain at historically low levels  helping affordability 
We can expect increasing purchases from young people 
Increased home prices enable more people to sell   trading up or even sideways to take new jobs 
It is easy to find disciples for each viewpoint 
As always  I have my own opinion in the conclusion  Make your own choice  and feel free to make your case in the comments 
But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was some good news 
 Framing  lumber prices are higher  One of the many reasons to follow  is finding data no one else mentions 
The  shallow industrial recession  seems to be over   provides both data and analysis 
Retail sales were much stronger than expected  up 1 3  versus expectations of 0 9   The retail earnings reports varied widely  with high end names doing poorly  Online sales were excellent and gas station sales moved higher   Remember that gas prices have been part of the recent retail weakness   Auto sales remain strong 
Life expectancy is higher   and health inequality is lower   of the  presents the data  including the chart below  There is still a downward slope in the data  but the entire line has shifted 

The Michigan sentiment index beat both last month and also expectations by a wide margin   95 8 versus about 90  This survey gets timely information about job creation and spending that we do not see elsewhere  As always  I recommend looking at the   and also great discussion  from Doug Short  This month I also recommend checking out the   You can find long term charts and a great explanation of the method  Here is the summary of the key forward looking data 

The job market improved  as indicated by the JOLTs report  I often describe this as the most misunderstood data release  Too many people try to use it to analyze net job growth  something better done with various other sources  The ECRI has a new indicator  something about purple animals  subtracting actual hires from job openings  and  if this difference increases  They seem to be on a mission to find something negative in the data  Here is their key chart 

Let s keep this simple 
Job openings are good   the more the better 
The quit rate shows voluntary departures from jobs  a strong signal of confidence about finding an alternative 
 has an article that is geared toward non economists  but explains the key points  The article notes that quits are highest in low paying jobs and lowest among financial services workers and government employees 
 the strength of the voluntary quit rate versus layoffs 

The Bad
Some of the news was negative 
Energy bankruptcies increased  despite rising oil prices   suggests that recent oil price increase might be too little  too late for many companies 
Rail traffic continues to worsen   the 10 6  y o y decline  adding a variety of interesting comparisons 
Earnings season continued with mixed data   has a nice weekly analysis with interesting charts and also a focused discussion on key sectors  Here are some of the main themes 
The 71  earnings  beat rate  is higher than usual  but everyone knows the expectations have been lowered 
Earnings declined for the fourth consecutive quarter 
The sales beat rate was below normal 
Many companies cited the strong dollar as a source of weakness  so they expect better future results 
Autos and internet sales showed the most strength 
A forgiving market did not punish  misses  as much as usual   at least on average 


Jobless claims edged higher  294 000 was the highest reading in more than a year     Employment is important and we should watch in closely   both job creation  which this does not measure  and job loss  which it does  
Business inventories rose more than expected  The inventory data is easy to spin and difficult to interpret accurately  Does it reflect unsold goods or business confidence in future sales    GEI  sees the bullish side 
Puerto Rico defaulted on a  400 billion debt payment  The Council on Foreign Relations  
The Ugly 
The TSA  Airport security lines have grown much longer  People are missing planes and some airlines are even delaying flights  Baggage is sitting outside because of inspection delays  There are no immediate plans for more TSA resources  so it is a matter allocating what is available  Here is a good story in   via a tweet from Real Clear Markets    of the lines at Chicago s Midway airport now has over two million views 
The comments from Guardian readers suggest that the situation is having an impact on potential international travelers 

The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  Nominations are welcome  I see plenty of opportunities 
Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  I recently made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the ten year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of   whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am now using our new model   Holmes   Holmes is a friendly watchdog in the same tradition as Oscar and Felix  but with a stronger emphasis on asset protection  We have found that the overall market indication is very helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
The new approach improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high  This is not market timing as we normally think of it  It is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short

The Week Ahead
We have a modest week for economic data  While I highlight the most important items  you can get an excellent comprehensive listing at Investing com  You can filter for country  type of report  and other factors 
The  A List  includes the following 
Housing starts and building permits  T   Most are looking for a rebound 
Existing home sales  F   Less GDP impact than new construction  but a good read on the market 
FOMC minutes  W   Expect pundit efforts to make something out of nothing 
Leading indicators  Th   A controversial but popular measure of economic trends 
Industrial production  T   An important but volatile series  Signs of improvement in a lagging sector 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B List  includes the following 
Philly Fed index  Th   I have promoted this indicator in importance after an academic study of it  First May data 
Business inventories  F   March data  but relevant for Q1 GDP 
CPI  T   Inflation by any measure remains of secondary importance until we get a few hot months  Then the story will change significantly 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 


There is a little FedSpeak  The Supreme Court will announce some decisions  perhaps including Obama actions on immigration and Puerto Rico  Political news will continue  and some are indeed attributing market weakness to the probable candidates  There are still a few important earnings reports 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have six different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
WTWA often suggests a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames 
Insight for Traders 
We continue our neutral market forecast  Felix is still 100  invested  but with less aggressive sectors  REITs and utilities have moved near the top of the list  The more cautious Holmes is also fully invested  Holmes uses a universe of nearly 1000 stocks  selected mostly by liquidity  Even when the overall market is neutral  there will often be some strong candidates  Holmes holds a maximum of 16 positions at one time  For more information about Felix  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix and Oscar s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com  They appear almost every day at Scutify  follow    I am trying to figure out a method to share some additional updates from Holmes  our new portfolio watchdog   You learn more about Holmes by writing to info at newarc dot com 
Dr  Brett offers innovative ideas for traders  and he does it week after week    Then prepare to be frustrated in your trading 

So what is our trader s need  It s the need to trade  the need to make money  If the market isn t making sense  there s no trade to put on and no money to be made  If the setup isn t there  the trade isn t there and neither are the profits  If a bad trade is placed  the fruits of a good trade are erased and there go profits  That same dynamic can also make it difficult to step away from screens  even though the trader recognizes in real time the signs of frustration  It s not OK to miss opportunity 

Holmes is barking agreement  Felix would also agree if he were here instead of at a blackjack table in Vegas  emailing daily results   I hope Felix doesn t get caught count counting cards like some of those other models 
 provides us with another valuable insight from  Davidson   This quotation shows what traders should really be watching  if they want to catch short term moves 

Today s pools of capital are seeking gains within the day by day trading frenzy  The least little shift is taken as the possibility of a new trend and capital shifts in anticipation 

And later 

Most of the discussion today centers on whether it is oil or the USD which is driving the correlation  This is like a discussion of which comes first  the  Chicken  or the  Egg   My perception is that the main driver in changing global trade balances  Even if one could unravel all the inputs we have on global trade  the data itself is incomplete with a number of nations treating global trade figures as state secrets  Global trade balances impact prices and currencies long term to produce the correlations seen in the chart from Jan 1973 


Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links

Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week  If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read  it would be David Merkel s post    He notes the low probability of real disaster scenarios  In the context of a thoughtful analysis  he provides the following advice 
If you give into fears like these  you can become prey to a variety of investment  experts  who counsel radical strategies that will only succeed with very low probability  Examples 

Strategies that neglect investing in risk assets at all  or pursue shorting them   Even with hedge funds you have to be careful  we passed the limits to arbitrage back in the late  90s  and since then aggregate returns have been poor  A few niche hedge funds make sense  but they limit their size  
Gold  odd commodities   trend following CTAs can sometimes make sense as a diversifier  but finding one with skill is tough

Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read AR every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in this  There are several great choices worth reading  but my favorite is from Josh Brown   that many investors have a  toxic combination  of reducing financial literacy and increasing confidence  It is nothing personal  but a general consequence of aging 
Outlook on China 
There has been a lot of very negative commentary about China in recent weeks  Some of this comes from outspoken hedge fund managers who have significant short positions  To balance this  investors need information from those who study and invest in China  One such source is   which provided an excellent briefing for financial advisors last week  While there were many key points  her are two worth extra emphasis 

And also  most observers focus on manufacturing  ignoring the planned shift to a service driven consumer economy 

My conclusion is that investing in China is not a matter of if  but when and how  The financial press emphasizes data points like the  flash PMI  which have little relevance to the key issues   Full disclosure  KraneShares offers KWEB  We own it in our aggressive program  and I am considering expanding it to more investors who need more international exposure

Watch out for   
  This cryptocurrency seems to include elements of multi level marketing  Ponzi schemes  and a lack of liquidity  There is always a great temptation to make money fast  but recent economic conditions may have increased the appetite  Before  investing  I urge you to do some careful research  Here is an opinion from a  and also one from  who has a great quotation from the  

The investment opportunity promises  guaranteed  returns 
The opportunity is described as  once in a lifetime   or pressures you to buy immediately  before it is too late  
The deal sounds too good to be true  Compare any promised return with the returns on well known stock indexes 
The investment offer was unsolicited 
You are unable to find any public information about the investment opportunity  Often  this is explained away as the investment being  by invitation only  and a  secret that is best kept  lest too many people get involved  
The opportunities or people touting them are located outside of the United States  This particular point gives the scam an exotic feel and includes the idea  real or implied  that profits can be squirreled away offshore and away from the taxing authorities

Final Thoughts 
Last week I offered a strong opinion about resolving the tension between various economic data sources  I make most of WTWA a balanced summary of what is happening  with an emphasis on a current theme  It is in the conclusion where I do my editorializing  As I noted last week  when I do not have a solid answer to the weekly theme question  I am not afraid to say so  If only more observers would do the same  Readers sometimes complain that I do not give a specific answer to my own question  That misses the point  The weekly question is my prediction for the market theme   what you will see in the media  I cannot control that  and it would be dishonest to claim an answer that I do not really have 
With respect to housing  I expect growing strength  It might not show up this month  since we are still following Bill McBride s     I plan to watch Calculated Risk stories this week for the best interpretation of the data  He  

Housing starts are up 13  from March 2014 to March 2016 
New home sales are up 25  over the two years 
Existing home sales are up 13  
House prices are up 9 7   Case Shiller National Index February 2014 to February 2016  
Some day I ll be bearish again on housing  But not in 2014   and not now 

My own reasons for longer term optimism include the following 
Supply  Not that long ago many were predicting a  shadow supply  of foreclosed homes  That was gradually absorbed  Now the same sources are discussing a lack of inventory 
Demand  When I first wrote about  shadow demand  it generated a lot of skepticism from readers  something that I embrace   We still have plenty of people living with parents when they would prefer their own home  Many magazine feature writers try to make this into a new preference of Millennials  I doubt it  Mostly this is the result of the lag in employment growth 
Demographic and social trends  These are also demand factors  of course  but as people enter the labor force  we get more household formation  Immigration policy has been a negative in recent years  and it remains a wild card 
Improving home prices  Many homeowners were making their payments  but were underwater on their mortgages  Higher prices have resolved some of that  They are now abler to move more readily  either to follow the jobs or to upgrade 
Trading and Investment Implications 
Traders must continue to work the trading range  guessing daily reaction to Fed speculation  the moves in the dollar  and the shifts in oil prices  On Friday  stronger economic data sent the market lower  For the short term the message is that  good news is bad news  
Investors should take the opposite perspective  The worry about the economic message from oil prices and interest rates is overdone  A good investor looks for good value  There is a method for this

217174,438690,CSCO,Is It Time To Go Long On Cisco Systems ,opinion,"The year 2015 was not a great one for Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ O CSCO  though it was not a bad one  However  the company has been a consistent performer with its earnings topping expectations  The strong fiscal second quarter numbers boosted the sentiments of investors by lifting its stock close to 10  when the overall market was witnessing a significant drop on Thursday  The current year appears to have started well for the company  The question is whether it can sustain the momentum throughout the year  The company is making earnest efforts to see that the current year is better than the last year  to say the least  by focusing on acquisitions to boost its software  as well as  services  That included security  cloud  video and collaboration markets  The year 2015 witnessed an accelerated pace of acquisitions as the company acquired eleven companies compared to six in the preceding year  Let s look at the positives  as well as  the negatives to take a call on going long 
China Plays A Crucial Role
Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  s results for the second quarter demonstrated both strengths and weaknesses  The macroeconomic environment has been a challenging one  and it did well to report better than expected revenues  One of the positive things was that the company was able to overcome the issues faced in China that have hurt its business in the past  One of the reasons it could not perform very well in the region was the suspicion among the corporate or the government entities that non Chinese hardware might be used by spies  The emergence of alternative products from the domestic manufacturers like Huawei Technologies has also hurts its business in the past 
That appeared to be a thing of the past as far as Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  was concerned  In November  the company reported that it was able to witness a 40  surge in the order rate in China  If anyone considered that as a one off event  the subsequent developments do not support the theory  A few days back  the network switch maker indicated that orders from China jumped 64  in the second quarter ended in January  The surge in the order was fueled by video equipment demand  The company is likely to maintain the momentum in getting the orders from China  which would be a positive for it 
Positives And Negatives From 2Q
Cisco Systems  Inc s   NASDAQ CSCO  revenue in routing equipment division advanced 5  in the second quarter  which faced rough weather lately and even shrank  Only communications carriers purchase the kind of hardware and their buying of the products steadily helped it to achieve the growth  Video equipment is witnessing hectic activity among the carriers  As a result  the segment witnessed 37  uptick in the recent quarter  Its other divisions  security  as well as  collaboration products also witnessed the growth of 11  and 3  respectively  Its other products surged 31  while services revenue advanced 2   The company gained from its tactical portfolio that focused on companies  as well as  countries than ever before on digitizing everything  That was because its focus or marketing was not restricted to IT alone 
The strength in some of the segments allowed it to gain 2  top line to reach  11 83 billion  However  there were also weaknesses for Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  that was due to the market conditions  For instance  its Switching revenue fell 4  YOY while revenue from Data Center dipped 3   Both the segment reversed the trend witnessed in the first quarter  Its CEO  Chuck Robbins  said that signs of caution started towards the close of the quarter among some corporate customers  He also indicated that the companies have started to held back orders on non essential purchases like the switching system used on the corporate campuses  That meant the customers were giving a pause and were trying to adjust to the current market conditions 
Identification Of Four Key Areas
Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO   four key areas for accelerating its innovation  as well as  portfolio transformation  Accordingly  the company is looking to define the next generation of networking starting with the data center with its ACI platform  The second key factor was the focus towards fueling growth in its security business  which assumes greater importance in the wake of increased threats from cyber criminals  The third factor is shifting its tactics more towards its portfolio that would be delivered in on premise  as well as  cloud based SaaS models  These three key factors should be good enough to keep propelling growth  Aside from that  the company plans to use M A as a tool to support its internal innovation in the key areas of growth 
 from these  Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  stands to gain from the acquisition of Jasper Technologies for  1 4 billion  The confidence was due to its role in IoT and that it could provide recurring revenues to the company  IoT devices are growing fast and that should offer an influx of data  which requires to be managed  The acquisition should help in offering software solutions to analyze the data  That would also support the hardware business and could provide synergy to growth  Similarly  the company s sports stadium connective effort is a bullish one because of the growing demand for connected services at sports venues  This could come with high growth potential with considerable potential for revenue and might go beyond the sports venues 
Valuation
Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  s return on assets and equity for the trailing twelve month period was 8 9  and 16 4  respectively compared to the industry average of 5 6  and 11 5  respectively  Its price to earnings for the same trailing twelve month period was 12 1 times compared to the industry average of 19 6 times  That meant there is potential for upside rewards  It had free cash flow of 3 6 billion 
Conclusion
Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  has not been an aggressive player  but its performance has always been steady  It rarely misses the expectations  Currently  the stock is trading a little over  2 above the 52 week low price reflecting the market conditions  While there are some weaknesses  the positive should be able to offset it  Currently  it seems to be there

Cybersecurity firm  Palo Alto Networks  PANW   is scheduled to report fiscal second quarter earnings February 25  after the market closes  The company has perennially beat on the top and bottom line reporting better than expected earnings in each of the past 5 quarters  This quarter might fare differently as investors have grown concerned following decelerated growth from industry leaders  Fortinet Inc  O FTNT   Checkpoint Systems Inc  N CKP  and Fireeye Inc  O FEYE   Consequently  shares of Palo Alto Networks have plunged 29 5  in 2016  by virtue of weaker demand and spending in the software security space 
This quarter the Estimize consensus  a weighted consensus that more heavily represents the most accurate analysts and recent estimates  is calling for EPS of  0 41  1 cent higher than the Estimize mean and 2 cents higher than Wall Street  while revenue expectations of  319 27  are roughly  2 million greater than the Street  Compared to the same period last year  this projects to be a 113  increase on the bottom line and 46  increase in sales  The company has historically beat EPS measures eclipsing Estimize 80  of the time and Wall Street a resounding 96  of the time  A significant source of concern in the software security space has arisen by virtue of the tight spending environment and competition from tech giants like Cisco Systems Inc  O CSCO   An increasingly competitive landscape could necessitate PANW to increase its spending on sales and marketing thereby limiting its current margin leverage  Moreover  Palo Alto may see limited traction in new product areas such as Traps and WildFire 
Nevertheless  Palo Alto Networks has reported consistent growth over the past 8 quarters with no sign of waning  In its past earnings call  the company reported a 29  YOY growth in its customer base driven by sales investmentments  Furthermore a strong billings base and ramped up adoption for additional subscription services have stimulated sound financials  The company s strategic focus on expansion should bode favorably for the company come this Thursday

217182,438698,CSCO,Can The Nokia Alcatel Lucent Deal Tilt the Market Equation ,opinion,"Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corporation is nearing completion of its proposed tie up with Alcatel Lucent SA  N ALU   For the most part  the union between Nokia and Alcatel Lucent  PA ALUA  is as offensive as it is defensive 
Nokia is seeking to acquire Alcatel Lucent to boost its telecom equipment business  As such  the company is both interested in defending its share in the telecom equipment market and taking share from the competition   primarily Huawei and Ericsson  ST ERICAs   
The combination of Nokia and Alcatel Lucent is expected to result in a communications technology powerhouse with strengths in segments such as fixed networks  wireless networks  applications and analytics among others 
However  a recent development is threatening to complicate the picture for the combined Nokia  In what appears like a reaction to Nokia s pending transformation  Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ O CSCO  recently announced collaboration with rival Ericsson  The two companies intend to work together in areas that include technology sharing and sales  The collaboration between Cisco and Ericsson is expected to yield  1 billion in additional revenues on both sides by 2018 
At the same time  Cisco seemed to predict chaos for the combined Nokia  Cisco s executive chairman  John Chambers  appears to suggest that Nokia s transformation through Alcatel Lucent buyout will be a long and disruptive process devoid of value  Therefore  as Nokia tackles complex integration issues  Cisco and Ericsson are plotting to take its market share 
How can Nokia be promising positive transformation with the acquisition of Alcatel Lucent when competitors have already taken notice of its weakness  Does it look like Nokia s management is equal to the challenge ahead  Can the deal with Alcatel Lucent tilt market equation in Nokia s favor 
Nothing like chaos
First  it is important to note that Nokia Corporation  ADR   NYSE NOK  officials have already dismissed the notion that Nokia Alcatel Lucent is a recipe for chaos  Instead  Nokia sees its combined sales force driving displacement of Ericsson and diluting the value in its joint venture with Cisco  But there is more to the integrated Nokia 
Strong execution
Nokia Corporation  ADR   NYSE NOK  s management has in the recent times demonstrated excellent strategy execution  especially on the operating efficiency front  That explains the steady improvements in the company s margins  In the last quarter  3Q2015   Nokia Networks operating margins rose to 13 6   exceeding the consensus estimate of 10 2   Operating margins in the quarter improved 10bps YoY and 2  sequentially 
The management of Nokia remains confident that the ambitious annual operating margins target of 8  to 11  is attainable 
Impressive margins expansion in the last two quarters is only part of the story in Nokia s efficiency drive  In the period between 2011 and 2014  the current management team was drove margins improvement at Nokia Networks to 12 2  from just about 1 6  

The impressive turnaround happened at a time when the small Nokia Networks appeared to be disadvantageously positioned against larger rivals Ericsson and Huawei 
Not only did Nokia Networks defy tough conditions to expand margins  but the business also took share from rivals in key markets  a trend that should accelerated in the new dispensation 
Spreading efficiency gospel
Nokia Networks amazing margins improvement over a short period came on the back of incredibly lean R D budget compared to rivals 
Given that Nokia has proven to be a master in cost cutting  it is only sensible to assume that the company will work to introduce the efficiency culture in Alcatel Lucent 
It is interesting also that Nokia s efficiency drive is set to meet Alcatel Lucent s SHIFT plan  which is also about cost cutting  Through its SHIFT plan  Alcatel Lucent has been able to register impressive margins improvements in the last few years  For example  margins are estimated to 6 6  this year from negative  1 8  in 2012  Further margin expansion is expected under the SHIFT plan with the possibility of margin ascending to 15  in the next few years 
Therefore  Alcatel Lucent is coming to improve profitability in the integrated Nokia  If the deal with Alcatel Lucent closes in 1Q2016 as anticipated  Nokia targets to register  900 million cost synergies by 2018  amount that looks conservative given the cost benefit potential of the combined company 
Sales growth
Combining Nokia and Alcatel Lucent is not only going to result in improvement in cost structure  but also drive sales growth as the combined entity takes market share from the competition  Ericsson is expected to take the heat as the new Nokia goes after its customers with more integrated solutions 
Besides the opportunity of pitching its own products and solutions alongside those of Alcatel Lucent  Nokia is also set to benefit from a more vibrant R D division  A more aggressive R D department should contribute more innovation to drive product differentiation and accelerate market share gain and revenue growth 
Additionally a vibrant R D should also drive more efficiency in the combined company  thus providing boost to the bottom line as well as the topline 
Cash flow narrative 
Continued cost curtailment and margins improvements should result in cash flow improvement in the integrated company  Nokia has been more aggressive than Alcatel Lucent in driving strong cash flow growth  but Alcatel Lucent s SHIFT plan should ultimately give lift to cash flow figures 
Shareholder value
Nokia Corporation  ADR   NYSE NOK  has shown interest in returning cash to shareholders  It is not currently know what fraction of free cash flow the company intends to return to shareholders in its integrated format  but it is likely to be more than rival Ericsson returns to its shareholders 
Customers and markets
Nokia Corporation  ADR   NYSE NOK  sells its telecommunications equipment to China Mobile Ltd  N CHL   Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and other global carriers  Acquisition of Alcatel Lucent should enhance the company s penetration in the U S   Chinese and Indian telecom markets to take advantage of carrier network upgrades  In the recent times  though  unfavorable economic conditions have seemed to soften spending on telecom equipment 
Conclusion
Nokia Corporation  ADR   NYSE NOK  has taken lessons from its past M A transactions to ensure that integrating Alcatel Lucent into its system becomes a smooth process  In that regard  Nokia has structure its marriage with Alcatel Lucent as a takeover rather than a joint venture  a format that is expected to eliminate any potential integration hurdles or execution conflicts

The euro bounces within the Flag formation 

The euro may be making its Master cycle low at the lower trendline of its Flag formation this week  There is good reason to believe that the euro may bounce for the next 2 3 weeks as it seeks the upper trendline of this expanding Flag  It is probable that the euro trend toward parity with the USD may resume with a vengeance once this head fake is complete

The yen may bounce 

The yen appears to have reached an early Master Cycle low and completed a bullish Flag formation that implies a target at or above mid Cycle resistance at 90 38  The bounce may last up to three weeks and may even visit the Cycle Top at 105 43 
 NewsMarkets  Japanese assets traded in Europe shrugged off the Bank of Japan s decision to leave monetary policy unchanged earlier on Friday  when some observers had expected it to loosen policy to boost sluggish economic growth and weak inflation  However  yen weakness could be on the cards 
Towards the end of the European day  the yen was just a tad firmer  with the dollar down to 120 41 yen from 121 13 late on Thursday  The yield on the 10 year Japanese government bond  or JGB  was also up only modestly  at 0 305   compared with 0 296  late on Thursday  Earlier  the Nikkei 225 stock market index had actually closed higher   up 0 8  at 19 083 10 
The Nikkei rose above Long term resistance 

The Nikkei rose above the lower trendline of its Broadening Wedge and Long term resistance at 19309 82  closing above both  but easing back from its high on Thursday  Broadening formations allow throwbacks before the final decline which may reach their targets  A probable reversal may be at hand  with weakness in the Cycle showing for the next three weeks  Should the subsequent decline go beneath mid cycle support at 16980 66  the Nikkei may experience a flash crash taking it to its cycle Bottom support at 12633 87

Gold fell beneath its weekly Cycle Bottom at 1092 60  but hasn t broken beneath its July low at 1072 30  It is possible that an early Master Cycle low may be in the making  but there is no clear reversal pattern  yet  The Cycles Model suggests an alternate pattern with more sustained low at the end of November or early December  A decline beneath 1072 30 may bring on the alternate view  With the loss of support  a lot may happen in the meantime

217219,438735,CSCO,An Option Strategy To Put The Odds On Your Side,opinion,"OK this one is targeted primarily to option traders  but can also be useful to traders who might consider trading options or to traders who are looking for a potential way to improve their investment odds 
So let s consider
A  A potentally bullish scenario
B  The standard way to play it
C  An alternative way to play it
In Figure 1 we see ticker Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  as of 3 17 15 
A  In an uptrend  above its 200 day moving average 
B  Bouncing off of an oversold reading  my  fell to  32 then reversed 
Figure 1  Courtesy  AIQ TradingExpert 
So for argument s sake let s refer to this as a  bullish scenario   In other words  we will hope that the uptrend will reassert itself and look for a way to make money if it does  while simultaneously limiting our risk by using an options strategy 
The  standard  approach would be to buy call options which stand to gain if the price of the stock goes up  For our example trade we will buy 15 CSCO May 2 call options at  0 60 per contract  The particulars appear in Figure 2 and the risk curves for this position appear in Figure 3 
Figure 2  Courtesty OptionsAnalysis com 

Figure 3  Courtesty OptionsAnalysis com 
 The cost and maximum risk is  900
 With the stock trading at  28 15  the breakeven price is  29 60
 There are 59 calendar days left until option expiration
An Alternative Approach  The Directional Calendar Spread
Now let s consider an alternative  This strategy is typically referred to as a  Directional Calendar Spread   Here s how I arrived at this trade 
At  I went to  Options Skewfinder  and created and save a  Wizard   a group of settings that can be reused in the future  with the settings that appear in Figure 4 
Figure 4
From the output screen I took the top ranked trade which involves buying the July 29 call and selling the May 29 call EXCEPT 
 Instead of trading this position in a 1 x 1 ratio
 We will trade it in a ratio of 3 x 2  this creates a position that has limited risk on the downside and unlimited profit potential on the upside   See Figure 6 
To compare apples to apples we will buy 18 July 29 calls and sell 12 May 29 calls so that the trade costs exactly the same as the long call trade    900 
The particulars and the risk curves for this trade appear in Figure 5 and 6 
Figure 5  Courtesty OptionsAnalysis com 

Figure 6  Courtesty OptionsAnalysis com 
There are many similarities and differences between these two trades but there are 4 key things to focus on 
1  The long call position does enjoy greater maximum profit potential as it has a higher  delta   556 versus 279 for the calendar spread  This means that for each dollar the stock rises in price the first trade will gain  556 and the second  279   So if a trader is flat out bullish and desiring to maximize his or her gains this trade will clearly make more money if that outlook proves to be correct 
2  The directional calendar spread stands to benefit from time decay   i e   the fact that option time premiums decline to zero by expiration   while the long call stand as to be hurt by time decay  We can tell this by the fact that the long call has a  Theta  value of   11 12  meaning it will lose  11 12 of time value each day  while the directional calendar spread has a positive  Theta  value of   0 28  
3  At May expiration the long call position will cease to exist as the May 29 call will expire  At May expiration the calendar spread will still hold 9 long July calls  which opens up other profit opportunities  for example  selling June calls and creating another spread position  
4  The directional calendar position has a breakeven price at the time of May option expiration of  approximately   27 95  I say  approximately  because a rise in implied volatility for the July call prior to May expiration could result in a higher breakeven price and vice versa   The long call position has a breakeven price of  29 60  almost  2 higher than the calendar spread 
In other words  if CSCO stock is below  29 60 prior to May expiration the position will show a loss  assuming of course that is held until expiration  the directional calendar spread could conceivably be showing a profit if CSCO is under at  27 95 a share at May expiration 
The trade off to consider is this 
1  The long call position has the greater profit potential 
2  The directional calendar spread has the greater probability of generating a profit 
Now let s fast forward to the close on 5 4 15  The price of the stock has risen from  28 15 to  29 17  At this point  one can argue that the Long May call position was the better trade  The stock rose 3 6  in price which caused the option to rise 41 7   A trader could sell this position right now and reap his or her reward  And taking a profit might just be an excellent idea at this point for the following reason 
 With 11 days left until expiration the stock is currently trading below the breakeven price of  29 60  So if his position is held another 11 days and the stock does not rise from the current price of  29 17 to  29 60 or above  then the current open profit of  375 will vanish and the trade end up showing a loss 
Figure 7  Courtesty OptionsAnalysis com 
Now let s look at the current status and future prospects for the directional calendar spread  As of 5 4 15 this trade is also showing a profit but the only  186  or  20 7   So again  it can be argued that the May long call has been the better trade  But before declaring a winner let s look at the future prospects for the directional calendar spread 
As you can see in Figure 8  time decay could help this directional calendar trade a lot as May expiration nears  In fact  the holder of this position would be perfectly content to see CSCO remain relatively unchanged between now and May expiration as the position profit could soar  
Figure 8  Courtesty OptionsAnalysis com 
Also  remember that when May option expiration hits  the holder of this position can either ext the entire position by selling the July calls and either buying back the May calls or letting them expire worthless depending on whether the price of CSCO is above or below the  29 strike price 
Summary
OK  so hat s a lot to  chew on   especially if your knowledge of options is limited  in fact if your knowledge of options is limited  let me say  Thank You  for slugging it all the way out to the end  So let s approach this from two angles 
If you are an  options person   and I think you know who you are  
Whether or not you ever employ the Directional Calender Spread strategy is not the primary point  The primary point is to always remember that there is usually more than one way to play any give situation  In this example buying the call option would have worked out fine and you could cash out 11 days prior to expiration and taken a nice profit and avoid any concerns about giving it back due to time decay 
Still the directional calendar spread still has alot of upside potential in the days ahead as time decay may serve to  boost  profits if CSCO does anything other than fall sharply  The holder of this position also has the opportunity to generate additional gains with the July call option portion of this trade

217220,438736,CSCO,Looking Ahead of Wall Street  Cisco Systems  Shake Shack  King Digital,opinion,"Earnings season is continuing to roll on as three big companies are reporting this week  What should investors be looking for 
Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  
Technology company Cisco Systems will announce its third quarter 2015 earnings results on Wednesday  May 13 before the market opens  The company is expected to post earnings of  0 53 a share and  11 54 billion in revenue  up from  0 46 earnings per share and  11 5 billion in revenue the same quarter a year prior 
Cisco System s transition into cloud computing has allowed the company to grow beyond its traditional area of routers and switches  In its Q2 2015 report on February 11 of this year  Cisco saw a 40  increase in its earnings driven by data relevant product and services  Cisco also reported that its Unified Computing System data center platform had been adopted by more than 41 000 customers 
However  in the third quarter Cisco faced a few hurdles including troubles in its typically well performing switching business  inconsistent demand from telecom carriers  and its instability in emerging markets  Despite this  analysts are generally confident on Cisco Systems ability to overcome these headwinds 
On average  the top analyst consensus for Cisco Systems on  is Moderate Buy 
Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK  
Hamburger restaurant chain Shake Shack is set to announce its first quarter 2015 earnings results on Wednesday  May 13 after market close  Analysts expects the company to post a loss of   0 03  a share 
The company currently operates just 63 restaurants in nine different countries  with 16 of them located in the metropolitan New York City area  The company said it plans to expand slowly with a goal to open 10 new locations in the United States every year  as well as add more international locations 
Shake Shack shares have not been doing so well lately  having fallen more than 12  on Thursday  May 7  Investors began to question the stock s valuation back in March due to the measured growth strategy presented by CEO Randy Garutti and Chairman Danny Meyer  Consequently  excitement for the stock has worn off and the stock has dropped 
On average  the top analyst consensus for Shake Shack on  is Hold 
King Digital Entertainment PLC  NYSE KING  
Mobile game maker King Digital Entertainment is slated to announce first quarter 2015 earnings on Thursday  May 14 after market close  Wall Street expects the company to post earnings of  0 46 a share  up from  0 41 earnings per share the same quarter last year 
In the last quarter  King Digital posted earnings of  0 57 per share  beating analysts  estimates by  0 10  but also marking an 11  decrease from the same quarter a year prior  The company posted adjusted revenue of  559 2 million  down from  601 4 million year over year  but coming ahead of analysts  consensus estimate of  519 93 million 
King Digital received a big boost in downloads for the sequel to its wildly popular game  Candy Crush  which picked the company up from out of a deepening hole  The company has said the success of the second Candy Crush game proves its ability to create popular games and extend the lifespan of its brands 
On average  the top analyst consensus for King Digital Entertainment on  is Hold ",2015-05-11,Carly Forster,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-ahead-of-wall-street:-cisco-systems,-shake-shack,-king-digital-e-251350",251350
217227,438743,CSCO,Cisco Shares Filled Upside Gap From February,opinion,Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  shares filled the upside gap from February as they found Fibo support late last week  The daily trend is still down  but the longer term trend is rather neutral as price is moving sideways during the last 4 months  A close above  28 50 would reinforce the bullish scenario  while a close below  27 50 would open the door to   month lows    26 CSCO daily chart  4 months  ,2015-03-18,Petros Steriotis,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-(csco)-technical-preview-march-18,-2015-245332",245332

217229,438745,CSCO,Does Cisco Belong In Your Dividend Portfolio ,opinion,"The NASDAQ Composite crossed 5 000 this year  reaching that threshold for the first time in 15 years  It s been a long road  but investors in the index can finally put the dot com boom and bust behind them 
But not all of the high flyers from the late 1990s have regained their former glory  It s hard to believe  but Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  was once one of the most valuable companies in the world 
Today  it doesn t even rank in the top 50 
And while Cisco stock has been rallying for the past four years    more than doubling since bottoming out in mid 2011    its price is still 65  below its old bubble high 
Cisco Systems stopped exciting momentum investors a long time ago and will probably never again be a growth dynamo  Its routers and switches have become commoditized products and face increasing pressure from cheaper software based alternatives  But this slower growing  more mature Cisco stock is starting to get attention from a different corner of the market  Dividend hunters 
A Friendly Face For Income Investors
Cisco declared and paid its first quarterly dividend in 2011  at 6 cents per share  and has since become a dividend raising machine  This quarter  Cisco raised its dividend for the fifth time in four years  to 21 cents per share  That s a 250  increase in just four years 

Let s play with the numbers a little here  Cisco s annual dividend of 84 cents works out to a current dividend yield of 3   Had you bought shares of Cisco stock just before its first dividend in 2011 and held on to it until today  your yield on cost would be just shy of 5    For those unfamiliar with the term   yield on cost  is the current annual dividend divided by the original purchase price  It s a useful metric for long term dividend investors investing primarily for income  
Seen by itself  Cisco s 3  dividend is not wildly compelling  Yes  it is significantly better than the 10 Year Treasury yield and the dividend yield on the S P 500  both of which offer about 1 9   But it is also significantly below the level of many REITs  MLPs  oil majors and other higher yielding corners of the market  So  if you re buying Cisco stock for its dividend  you had better be confident that its high rate of dividend growth will continue 
Well  we may not see 250  growth every four years going forward  but I do expect Cisco to be one of the biggest raisers among its large cap peers 
When Cisco decided to pay its first dividend  it essentially made a new pact with shareholders  Henceforth  Cisco would be committed to rewarding its patient shareholders with dividends equal to at least 50  of its annual free cash flow 
On that count  Cisco actually has a little catching up to do  Over the trailing 12 months  its free cash flow has totaled  2 12 per share  That puts its current dividend at about 40  of free cash flow  Another popular metric for dividend sustainability  the dividend payout ratio  also indicates that Cisco has a little wiggle room to keep raising its dividend  Cisco s current dividend payout ratio is a very reasonable 45  
Of course  ultimately Cisco s ability to keep raising its dividend will hinge on its ability to grow its earnings  And on that count  Cisco s prospects aren t looking bad  Last quarter  Cisco beat analyst earnings estimates and offered upbeat guidance going forward  Even in a more competitive environment  Cisco has managed to double its revenues over the past decade 
Bottom Line
Cisco s competitive pressures will not be going away overnight  and it will probably see continued margin erosion for the foreseeable future  I should emphasize again that this is not a high growth company  But Cisco stock would make a nice addition to a diversified dividend stock portfolio

217230,438746,CSCO,The Week Ahead  Economic Spring Thaw On The Horizon ,opinion,"In the absence of real data it is easy and tempting to speculate  Unlike last week  the week ahead featured an avalanche of data   more in both quantity and importance than we have seen in a month  With some recent significant reports showing economic improvement we expect a change of focus 
It is time for an economic spring thaw  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted a weeklong quest for new market worries  I even named a few candidates  Helped by early week selling  this forecast proved to be very accurate  Veteran CNBC anchors who had obviously not read my primer on volatility made silly statements like  the Dow was down triple digits earlier but now is in the green  Oh  it is now down three points   A worried viewer is a loyal viewer  Don t touch that dial  A quick review of  shows Yemen  Fed commentary  biotechs  semis  energy  transports  and others too numerous to mention 
And a surprise  a fresh omen  
Doug Short s pictures are always   Read his full weekly  snapshot  post for informative long term charts  and an analysis of drawdowns 

Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
The upcoming week has interesting calendar effects 
It combines end of month and start of month data   a combination of important reports 
It is holiday shortened  but with a twist  The market rarely is on holiday while the government is in action  but this week is an exception  The employment situation report will be released  as usual  on Friday  There also will be Fed conference presentations 
I expect position squaring in front of Friday s news 
Significant reports from last week   home sales  retail sales  and initial jobless claims   all showed an economic uptick  This combination of factors may create a more positive focus for market pundits  I expect many to be asking 
Will there be an economic spring thaw  
The Viewpoints

No excuses  Winter occurs every year  The economic weakness continues 
This winter was exceptional  Seasonally adjusted data have not done justice to the cold weather effects 
The most important data   employment and retail sales   have shown strength 



As always  I have some additional ideas in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  

Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was some good news last week 
Compromise in the House  Party leaders Boehner and Pelosi huddled up and  on Medicare reforms  It is good to see a solution for an issue that has required an annual  doc fix  in Medicare payments  It is even more important that there is some ability for leaders to compromise when action is needed 
Michigan sentiment strengthened and beat expectations  No one captures the whole picture as well as  

Earnings expectations seem to have bottomed  Brian Gilmartin tracks this closely for the S P 500 and still   He also   which have been better than usual 
Overall corporate profits remain strong  Scott Grannis has emphasized this for several years  He  

To fully understand this argument  I recommend reading a series of  over the past 5 6 years  I m using the same charts over and over  and making the same basic argument  which is that corporate profits have been extraordinarily strong for years  but the market has been  and is still  unwilling to assign an unusually high multiple to those profits  This tells me that equities could be fairly valued at current levels  and at the very least they do not appear to be  overvalued  



Hotel occupancy is strong   has the story about a possible new record  This confirms my anecdotal experience in New Orleans  where hotels and restaurants were busy and lively 
Initial jobless claims improved   back below the three handle 
New home sales solidly beat expectations  an annualized growth of 539K   the good start to the year  helped by the reduced number of distressed sales 
European economies are improving  Here is one of the  

The Bad
There was also a little discouraging economic news  although less than market results would suggest 
FedSpeak tilted hawkish   and  signaled the possibility of a faster path for rate increases  Even Yellen provided some support 
Durable goods fell 1 4  while a small gain was expected   takes a close look  adjusting for both population and inflation 
Q414 GDP disappointed some observers who expected a positive revision to the 2 2  increase  Some thought it was better than it looked     Most were more skeptical  Doug Short and Steven Hansen at   
High frequency indicators were mixed  but leaning negative according to New Deal Democrat s  
The trucking index declined in February      Some are concerned about Dow Theory readings from the transport sector 
The Ugly
Yemen  The initial impact has been a spike in oil prices  which has hurt consumers without really helping energy companies  The threat is even greater now that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council states have joined in the air strikes   has an interesting analysis

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders
Felix switched to bullish from neutral for the three week market forecast  There is still extremely high uncertainty  reflected by the percentage of sectors in the penalty box  Our current position is still fully invested in three leading sectors  mostly because there have been good opportunities in spite of the volatility  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com 
Felix did not enter the hedge    20 000 in cash and prizes   but he is making a daily appearance to mention a top sector 
Our best trader article this week comes from   Mike Bellafiore has a list of lessons that includes some familiar ideas  He adds value with a link to a strong article for each lesson  Traders can profitable spend a few hours reviewing these links 
Insight for Investors
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links 
We also have a new page summarizing many of the   If you read something scary  this is a good place to do some fact checking 
One of my recurrent themes for investors is to turn the page whenever the see a story about the  aging bull  or a prediction that the market is  due  for a major correction 
Bull markets do not die of old age  This economic cycle  the basis for the stock market cycle  features a sharp decline and a very gradual recovery  It could continue for years  Dr  Ed joins in on this theme 

A long expansion is a persuasive argument for buying stocks even though forward P Es are historically high  Investors are likely to be willing to pay more for stocks if they perceive that the economic expansion could last  let s say  another four years rather than another two years  The more time we have before the next recession  the more time that earnings can grow to justify currently high valuations 
If a recession is imminent  stocks should obviously be sold immediately  especially if they have historically high P Es based on the erroneous assumption that the expansion s longevity will be well above average  Bull markets don t die of old age  They are killed by recessions 

Other Advice
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
Featured Commentary
If I were to recommend a single source this week  it would be the  with Legg Mason s Bill Miller  Watching the entire piece will be six minutes well spent  Miller  no relation  is a value investor who famously beat the market for ten consecutive years  He has a great process to underscore the excellent long term results  Here are three points you should get from the interview 
There are plenty of cheap stocks  He mentions several and features four  of which we own two  
He likes biotech and homebuilders 
Investors should not worry about the initial Fed moves  Worry when policy switches from neutral to tightening  not from accommodative to neutral  Miller says that this first step might take several years  If there is a tantrum  it will be a temporary move and a buying opportunity 
Some great investment opportunities have no current earnings  or low earnings with great growth potential  biotech   This is an interesting perspective from a value investor 
And a humorous note   CNBC puts up the wrong stock symbol and chart  causing a 1  pop in the  mistake   A bit later they post the correct information  Those doing the interview did not know  of course  and no correction was made  Trying to trade these TV interviews is a losing proposition  especially
Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor  even if busy  should join with a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in this  
Stock Ideas
Chuck Carnevale continues his series on retirement ideas taking a  at Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   He uses the analysis to illustrate some of the new features of his indispensable FastGraphs tool  It is a standard part of our analysis of stock candidates  and this is an easy way for you to see the features 
Your stock picks are probably biased by familiarity with certain companies and products  A great company is not necessarily a great investment  If you have a March Madness bracket  you might appreciate this lesson about the most popular picks   why popular may not have  edge  in your pool  Enjoy the interactive chart and remember for next year 
Methods
This   from Adam Grimes  is about trading  but it is equally true for investors  You can always find a justification for whatever action you want to take  You need to ask what could prove you wrong 

Karl Popper was one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century scientist  philosopher  and philosopher of science  At the risk of oversimplifying  one of his most important ideas provides the foundation for modern scientific thought  ideas can never be proved  only disproved  We need to focus not on finding things that support our ideas  but we should look for pieces of information that contradict  An idea is only meaningful insomuch as it can be disproved 

Energy Stocks
Ed Yardeni does not see a real bottom in prices until there is better balance in supply and demand 

Biotech Stocks
Frothy    

Contrast will Bill Miller  above  who cites biotech names as possibly the best stocks ever  No chart can capture the scientific or market potential  Short term trading often depends upon psychology 
Economic Worries
 why concerns are exaggerated when it comes to the magnitude of student debt 
Rising rates   at least in early stages    

Bond Funds
 about the stretch for yield in unconstrained bond funds   many traps 
I m from the government 
 and I m here to help you  Dodd Frank s watchdogs have a summary of the bearish case about stocks  The  warns to look out below 
The report shows no balance or awareness about the debate over valuation methods  Your tax dollars at work 
Final Thought
Watching for the spring thaw involves separating data from noise 
Last week I explained why  the popular market worries are not very convincing   The Bill Miller interview    included his statement that there have been 16  corrections  of 3  or more during the current bull market  In each of these his fund experienced redemptions  Whenever we have a spate of selling  even if the underlying fundamentals have not changed  some people have been primed to sell 
Some are playing the  due theory  while ignoring actual data  see discussion above on old age and bull markets  
Some are using  trailing stops  which confuses their investing with trading 
Some are convinced by the every changing wall of worry 
Some believe the  bubble  talk  and sell at the first sign of a dip 
Investors who have been out of the market have similar concerns  keeping them in cash  bonds  or dangerous bond proxies 
It is not that complicated if you stick with the fundamentals 
There is little chance of recession in the next year  Recessions occur at business cycle peaks and are associated with the big market declines 
Earnings expectations have been hit by the energy sector and the strong dollar  but remain OK  Some of these effects have probably peaked 
An improving US economy is fundamentally good for stocks  The Fed is on track to remain accommodative for years 
Foreign central banks are on a mission to stimulate  probably now including the Chinese 
There is a long list of well documented worries providing plenty of fear 
Investors must use fundamental methods that recognize both opportunity and danger  It is not simply a matter of time  And especially  you cannot treat every market blip as the start of  the big one  ",2015-03-29,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-time-for-an-economic-spring-thaw-246558,246558

217268,438784,CSCO,Growth Stocks Provide Evidence Of Vulnerability,opinion,"Higher Growth Shares Continue To Lag
Leadership in the financial markets speaks to investor conviction  If you want to know where demand is strong  a leadership list is a good place to start  When investors are confident about increasing stock prices  they tend to demand companies with faster growth rates  since the potential return is greater than their more mature blue chip brothers  For example  during the dot com craze high flyer Cisco  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  significantly outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  

The endless stock rally of 2013 was led by small caps and technology stocks  telling us the tolerance for risk was high  Thus far  2014 is taking on a much more conservative look  From  

U S  stocks closed broadly lower Tuesday  with declines concentrated in smaller  high growth stocks and consumer Internet shares  T he Russell 2000 index of smaller capitalization stocks shed 1 6  to close at the lowest level since Feb  6  The Russell 2000 has resumed a selloff this month  and is now down 4 8  on the year  compared with a 1  gain in the S P 500  Frank Cappelleri  sales trader at brokerage firm Instinet  said the resumed weakness in small cap stocks is weighing down a thinly traded market   Continued underperformance by the Russell 2000 relative to the S P 500 is something we can t ignore   Mr  Cappelleri said   Anytime you have a major part of the market not participating in a rally   it s going to give investors pause  he said   If you look at the leader board  it s the growth stocks that are getting hit   said Joe Saluzzi  co head of equity trading at institutional brokerage firm Themis Trading 

Vulnerable Tech Profile
Leadership that has been in place for several months does not change in a session or two  It can take several weeks or months for the change in investor perceptions to show up meaningfully from an intermediate term perspective  For example  the NASDAQ s 50 day moving average began to show signs of vulnerability in March 2011  see red arrow on left below   Five months later  the NASDAQ experienced a waterfall plunge in August 2011  see blue arrow  

How Does The Same Chart Look Today 
The current chart of the NASDAQ looks vulnerable  When the blue 50 day rolls over it tells us the intermediate term trend is trying to flip from bullish  economic conviction  to bearish  economic fear  

The Wild Card Named Putin
Geopolitical events always bring an extra layer of uncertainty to allocation decisions  especially those that are taking place several time zones away  Traders and money managers do not like overnight or weekend exposure during acute phases of conflicts  similar to what is taking place between Russia and Ukraine now  From  

Traders also kept an eye on developments in Ukraine  where supporters of Russia and of a united Ukraine are accusing each other of tearing the country apart  The former Soviet republic is sliding toward war   The short term issue is Ukraine  We don t know when we ll wake up one morning and  Russian President Vladimir  Putin is going to be in eastern Ukraine   said Jack De Gan  chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth  New Hampshire 

Investment Implications   Shorter Leash For Risk
Taken in isolation  is a vulnerable NASDAQ chart a reason to reduce equity risk  No  in fact nothing taken in isolation in the financial markets is significant enough to call for radical reactions  However  when the weight of the evidence  from multiple sources  begins to align in a  pay closer attention  manner  it means the odds of something bad happening in the stock market are increasing  We have been watching the Dow s sideways and indecisive action since  April 4  The current version of the chart  below  is still concerning

217269,438785,CSCO,361 Capital Weekly Research  Why Do Treasury Yields Keep Falling ,opinion,"If you are still asking  Why do Treasury yields keep falling   then maybe you should have paid up for that Bernanke dinner last week 

In a series of quarter million dollar dinners with wealthy private investors  Ben Bernanke has been clearer than he ever was as chairman of the Federal Reserve on his expectations that easy money policies and below normal interest rates are here for a long time to come  according to some of those in attendance  Bernanke  who retired from the U S  central bank in January  has predicted the Fed will only very slowly move to raise rates  and probably do so later than many forecast because the labor market still has a lot more room to recover from the financial crisis and recession  The accounts of the discussions come from attendees as well as those who heard second hand what was said at the dinners  where hedge fund managers and others willing to foot the roughly  250 000 bill for each event asked the former Fed chairman questions in a free flowing round table fashion over recent weeks  At least one guest left a New York restaurant with the impression Bernanke  60  does not expect the federal funds rate  the Fed s main benchmark interest rate  to rise back to its long term average of around 4 percent in Bernanke s lifetime  one source who had spoken to the guest said 
Also  on a relative basis  U S  Bonds are bloody cheap compared to their Euro counterparts  If the  reasons  had to be ranked  it really does seem like Europe is driving markets  not Treasuries    a combination of falling nominal growth assumptions  this is occurring even as real estimates tick higher  but more importantly ECB anticipation has driven yields lower throughout the Eurozone  opening up an arbitrage opportunity in the process  10 year yields are now 1 3  in Germany  2 95  in Spain  3  in Italy  3 7  in Portugal  2 6  in Ireland  2 5  in the UK  etc   these numbers make U S  10yr yields seem relatively cheap in comparison 
Just look at this list of Countries with 10 year yields less than the U S  I can t listen to a talking head  bond manager  strategist or seemingly anyone without hearing about how  Rates can only go higher from here   When in reality THEY CAN go lower  In fact  when you look around the world  on a relative basis  THEY SHOULD  Look at that list and tell me the United States should pay more on their debt then all those countries  France is borrowing at 1 77  people  FRANCE  You have Japan borrowing at a rate 76  lower than the U S  with more than twice the debt  Now all this doesn t mean the United States SHOULD trade lower  but it s either that or others SHOULD trade higher because on a relative basis  much is out of whack  And those calling for much higher rates in the U S  should realize that basket cases like Italy and Spain are trading at 3 1

The youth of India have voted and they elected Growth  The vote amounted to a surprisingly broad repudiation of Congress s welfare focused approach to policy making and an endorsement of Mr  Modi s call for more effective governance and business friendly measures to create jobs and drive growth   I didn t get a chance to sacrifice my life in India s freedom struggle  but I have the chance to dedicate myself to good governance   Mr  Modi said to cheers in a victory speech in his home state of Gujarat on Friday night   I will develop this country  I will take it to new heights   Mr  Modi tapped into the frustrations of a generation of Indians who climbed out of poverty in the past decade  but who have been prevented from joining the middle classes by slowing growth and a lack of employment  It is a generation that aspires to better work opportunities  a higher standard of living and world class infrastructure   Modi will change the country 100    said Vijay Thakur  a 31 year old cabdriver in Gujarat   He will bring rapid development  he will bring foreign companies to India  everyone will have jobs     
India will see a massive growth in their working age population over the next 10 years so no better time to shift political gears away from what wasn t working  The elections also underpin the point we have made often over the past few months   Indian youth s rising aspirations  desire for growth and development  and strong leadership are driving the political debate in the country  This increases the probability that the new government will focus on development and governance as its prime agenda  It sets the stage for India s structural story to unfold in the coming years as we have highlighted in our recent note  The Next India   We have assumed a greater chance of a reform agenda even though clarity on this will emerge in the ensuing weeks 

The risk markets also voted on India and they chose Growth

This is just wrong and it will continue to crimp keeping the U S  economy from reaching its full growth potential  In 2012  the most recent year for which data are available  workers with just a bachelor s degree were making a median salary of  46 900 a year while the average student loan balance for people under 30 years old was  21 400  Those numbers aren t directly comparable  but it does seem that most young people can pay back their debts  The problem developing is that earnings and debt aren t moving in the same direction  From 2005 to 2012  average student loan debt has jumped 35   adjusting for inflation  while the median salary has actually dropped by 2 2   If that continues debt burdens could start to become more unwieldy

217282,438798,CSCO,Dow Jones Bounces Back In 2 Day Rally,opinion,"A two day rally brings the Dow Jones Industrial Average back above its 200 day moving average
 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  and other major U S  stock indexes put in a volatile week  starting with a sharp decline only to end with gains for the week 
Major stock indexes put on an impressive showing on Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  gaining 165 points  1 06   the SP500  SPY  adding 1 33   the Nasdaq Composite  QQQ  jumping 1 69  and the Russell 2000  IWM  climbing 1 14  on the day 
For the week  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  climbed 0 6   the SP500  SPY  added 0 8  and the Nasdaq  QQQ  gained 0 5  
Friday s big news was the January Non Farm Payrolls report which showed just 113 000 jobs being added in January  a huge miss from the expected 190 000  and up from December s weak 75 000   Most analysts suggest that it takes 100 000 new jobs per month just to accommodate new entrants to the work force   More uncertainty was added to the employment situation with the household survey indicating a gain of 616 000 
On My Stock Market Radar
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  reclaimed its 200 day moving average which was a significant gain on a technical basis but the index still remains below its 50 day moving average which is in a slight downtrend   Relative strength is turning up from oversold levels and momentum is turning positive 
A solid close above the 50 day moving average would point to the short correction being over and the opportunity for more gains ahead   Point and figure charting for the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains on a  sell  signal with a downside price objective of 14 950 and significant resistance levels are 15 900 16 000 and at the blue 50 day moving average line 

In other news  Apple  Nasdaq AAPL  bought back  14 billion of its shares which bolstered the company s stock price by 1 4  on Friday 
In other major markets  gold  GLD  and oil  USO  both showed weekly gains 
Several interesting events occurred this week 
1  Investors pulled record sums from stock funds and went to bond funds as reported by  
2  Noted technical analyst Tom DeMark compared this period over the next few days to the days just before the crash in 1929  
3  Emerging markets funds have had greater outflows so far this year than in all of 2014  
4  Monday s trading was the worst start to a February since 1983 
Economic reports were mostly negative this week with factory orders  car sales  ISM and construction spending all declining 
Volatility is obviously on the rise as triple digit moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average become more prevalent  and VIX  the S P500 Volatility Index  also known as the fear indicator  has taken a wild ride from 12 to 21 and back to 15 since the beginning of the year  falling 11 2  on Friday alone 
Next week brings a number of important events including 
Tuesday  Janet Yellen testifies for the first time as Chairman of the Federal Reserve before the House Financial Services Committee   Markets will be eager to hear what her plans are for the continued tapering of the Fed bond buying program 
Thursday  weekly jobless claims  January retail sales  Janet Yellen testifies at the Senate
Friday  January Industrial Production  University of Michigan consumer sentiment 
Important earnings reports will come from several big hitters  even as earnings season draws to a close 
Tuesday  Sprint
Wednesday  Cisco  CSCO 
Thursday  Pepsi  PEP 
Of course  the most importantt of these events will be Janet Yellen s Congressional debut  followed by the retail sales report on Thursday 
Bottom line  While many analysts say the correction is over  technical and fundamental indicators show that the jury is still out for the week ahead

217283,438799,CSCO,What The Buy Side Expects From Cisco,opinion,"Cisco Systems  CSCO  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday  February 12th  Cisco is the world s largest supplier of networking equipment  The company is currently going through a transition where it will refocus on areas of growth including data center hardware  security software  and mobile products  As a result of the transition analysts are expecting both EPS and revenue to be down compared to the same time last year  One cost associated with the transition was the  2 7 billion dollar acquisition of security software firm Sourcefire  Recent revelations of NSA spying may also cut into Cisco s export sales as foreign firms worry about NSA spying through backdoors in the company s products   The transformation that Cisco is undergoing will take time and may be painful but management believes the strategic shift will be worthwhile  Here s how investors expect Cisco to report this quarter 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors  
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for CSCO to report 46c EPS and  11 119B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 36 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is also 46c EPS and  11 198B revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting CSCO to report in line with Wall Street on EPS but exceed on revenue 
Throughout the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting CSCO profit everytime and has been more accurate in predicting revenue twice  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing no difference in EPS consensuses and a larger differential than usual on revenue  
This quarter analysts are expecting profit and revenue to be down compared to FQ2 2013  The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 41c to 51c EPS and  10 970B to  11 800B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a slightly wider distribution of estimates for CSCO compared to recent quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 
Throughout the quarter the EPS consensus from Wall Street fell from 52c to 46c while the Estimize EPS consensus both started and ended the quarter at 46c  Over the same time period Wall Street lowered its revenue expectation from  12 642B to  11 119B while the Estimize forecast also decreased from  11 381B to  11 198B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions going into a report are often a bearish indicator 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is beckyhiu who projects 47c EPS and  11 130B in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season beckyhiu rated as the 260th best analyst and is ranked 258th overall among over 3 800 contributing analysts  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case beckyhiu is expecting CSCO to beat the Street on profit and revenue  but report less revenue than the Estimize community is calling for 
While Cisco is going through a tranisiton  contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform still expect the company to beat the Street s projection on revenue and report in line on EPS  Things may be slow for Cisco for awhile but the company is hoping to emerge from the shift to data center hardware  security software  and mobile products in a better position than it found itself in previously

217285,438801,CSCO,Reckless New Fad  Companies Raise Money  Buy Back Stock  Pay Dividends,opinion,"Last Thursday  the CEO of DIRECTV  DTV  said   we are pleased to announce a share repurchase program of  3 5 billion  This repurchase program reflects our strong balance sheet and confidence in continued strong DIRECTV revenue  earnings and free cash flow growth  as well as our belief that our stock is far below our intrinsic value    Source   DIRECTV Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Results   DIRECTV  February 20  2014  
DIRECTV is buying back its shares because it believes they are undervalued  Since when did CEOs of companies on key stock indices become stock pickers 
In 2013  DIRECTV s total corporate earnings came in at  2 85 billion  That means the company is spending 122  of what it made in 2013 to buy back its stock  Talk about pumping up per share earnings 
Cisco Systems  Inc   CSCO   another major component of key stock indices  reports it is  raising   8 0 billion to repay some of its debt  It will use the remainder of the money to buy back its shares and pay dividends   Source  Cisco Systems  Inc   February 24  2014   Yes  instead of raising money to invest in equipment  technology  or research and development  R D   the new fad is for companies to raise money to buy back their shares and pay dividends 
These are only two examples of companies in key stock indices using share buybacks to make their per share corporate earnings look better  There are many others that are doing the exact same thing 
Dear reader  with corporate earnings growth falling to its lowest level since 2009  companies have no choice but to prop up earnings via stock buyback programs  Companies in key stock indices are worried about their corporate earnings  By no surprise  so far  75 of the S P 500 companies have issued negative corporate earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2014   Source  FactSet  February 21  2014  
Fundamentals  Technicals  They are getting thrown out the window  First  we had the Federal Reserve print money to buy U S  Treasuries and the illiquid mortgage backed securities on the books of the big banks  Now  we have big public companies in key stock indices borrowing money to buy back their stock and to pay their shareholders dividends  Does any of this make sense any more 
The run up in key stock indices we ve seen since 2009 is reaching its last months  if not weeks  At this point  I m fearful of what s to come for key stock indices  because as far as I am concerned  irrational behavior has taken over the markets

217296,438812,CSCO,A Technical Look  Major Market Averages  Cisco And Tesla ,opinion,All the major market averages remain in defined up trends  The S P 500 along with the broader market suffered some higher than usual volatility on Thursday but finished the week strong on the back of a better than expected Non Farm Payroll report   We have addressed the technical structure of the S P 500 in the last post  last week and not much has changed since  As the chart above denotes  any potential further weakness in the near term should find support near the May highs at 1709 which from current highs would match the size of the last two corrections as well  Also last week we highlighted the fact that the upside target in the S P 500 had been reached and that the next ultimate target really came down to the Dow from here on out  Here s a look at the Dow chart  we can see how this latest consolidation phase taken place above the May highs along with the fact that this week we were able to close above each of the last three swing highs  It s really hard to get too near term bearish right now Here s is what may become the ultimate target for this bull market  This chart above shows trading in the Dow going all the way back to 1998  I ve highlighted each bull market high point over the last 15  years  You can see that each time the Dow got approximately 2400 points overextended above it s previous bull market top  the bull market ended Using this calculation we can project a potential bull market target of approximately 16 580   16 645  As further confluence we can see the last bull market lasted 5 years so March of 2014 would also match the time frame of the previous  Along with the fact the last two bull market highs came 7 years apart  2000 2007  another 7 years would also yield 2014 Now the intentions are not to try to  pick a top  but rather highlight a historical pattern and heighten your alert if indeed we get some weakness off those levels  Also I am not in anyway saying a major crash will proceed either  I am very long term bullish and believe the markets are headed much much higher over time  Check out  I created over the summer if you don t believe me  However a good 20  correction from our target levels would be healthy and in line with the historical market moves  This is the more likely scenario in my mind  I will certainly elaborate on specific downside targets if we see weakness setup  But for know there really is no reason to jump the gun and overthink things Let s take a look at the Russell 2000 in the above chart as that is what I believe was the key to market movement this week  I ve highlighted the supply and demand pattern I can see develop since early this year  We have seen a series of rallies between 110 120 points and declines between 44 55 points That pattern came into play again this week as the Small caps have underperformed lately  We will see if this momentum can carry the broader market higher or will the S P 500 drag it back to so it can find it s own support around the 1709 area we pointed out Taking a quick look at a couple stocks  Cisco  CSCO  has seemingly found support around  22 which was a prior pivot high and also nearly matched the drop the October highs to the low at  23 33 when taken from the last swing high at  24 80  Cisco has performed pretty well this week and the real test should come soon as resistance is near at  23 75  I believe a break above bodes well for shifting the short term trend back up again and making a run back to  26 Sticking with Tesla  TSLA  from last week   at  180  The high for the week ended up coming in at exactly  181 43 before falling after earnings were announced  Resistance now stands at  160 and as long as it stays below this stock is likely headed to support at  115 and possibly the 200 day moving average around  105 Taking a look at the Advance   Decline line on the NYSE  We can see a clean  back and fill  reaction as it fell back to it s previous two highs for support Let s conclude with the relative performance by sector since the October 9th swing low was put in ,2013-11-09,Michael Gouvalaris,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-technical-look:-major-market-averages,-cisco-and-tesla-191262",191262

217377,438893,CSCO,Stocks Plummet Amid Worries About Europe  Fiscal Cliff,opinion,The U S  stock market recorded large losses on Wednesday as the mood on Wall Street continues to deteriorate amid worries over Europe and the fiscal cliff  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 185 points to close at 12 571  The widely watched blue chip index traded in a range between 12 542 and 12 797   The SPDR S P 500 ETF  SPY  lost 1 35 percent to  135 93  The sell off caused volume to spike  with around 178 6 million SPY shares trading hands compared to a 3 month daily average of 123 6 million   The PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF  QQQ   which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100  fell 1 17 percent to  62 24  The losses would have been worse  but a 5 percent gain for Cisco  CSCO  after reporting strong earnings helped the ETF   Crude oil was higher on the session despite the weak stock market  NYMEX crude futures  the U S  benchmark  were last trading up 1 08 percent to  86 30  Brent crude futures climbed 1 34 percent to  109 71 and the U S  Oil Fund ETF  USO  closed trading up 1 15 percent to  31 77   Precious metals eked out small gains  COMEX gold futures were last up 0 06 percent to  1 725 80 and silver futures had risen 0 52 percent to  32 66  The heavily traded SPDR Gold Trust ETF  GLD  closed the day essentially flat at  167 14   The sell off in stocks helped Treasuries rise slightly  The iShares Barclays 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  added 0 09 percent to  126 73  The yield on the 10 Year Note was basically flat on the day at 1 59 percent   The U S  dollar recorded a very small loss on the session  The PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish ETF  UUP   which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of foreign currencies  fell 0 05 percent to  22 20  At last check  the closely watched EUR USD pair was trading at  1 2746 By Scott Rubin,2012-11-15,Benzinga ,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-plummet-amid-worries-about-europe,-fiscal-cliff-143642",143642
217378,438894,CSCO,Cisco  Undervalued Dividend Growth Stock Could Boost Your Retirement ,opinion,We don t believe that anyone will argue against  or should argue against  the idea that the Internet will continue to grow for many years to come  Cisco Systems  CSCO  is the world s largest supplier of high performance Internet networking systems and solutions  According to research from Standard   Poor s Corp   Cisco s product families are comprised of four segments  Switches represent 32  of fiscal product sales  routers represent 18   new products  the biggest segment  representing 48   and the final category is other representing 2  of fiscal sales  Cisco reported earnings yesterday and the market seems pleased with what it saw  Earnings  and revenues were both better than forecast     We felt that the following quote from CEO John Chambers during their conference call nicely summarized the opportunity in front of Cisco  and frankly  its many competitors  In a world of many clouds mobility  bring your own device  and the internet literally connecting everything  The network has never played a more central role  connecting people  the process  data and things  anywhere  anytime  across any device  In this cloud of mobile world  the challenges of scale  agility  security and resilience can only be addressed by an intelligent network  and Cisco is uniquely positioned to help our customers meet business requirements and drive this new growth  However  regardless of their good quarter  and the well defined long term opportunity in front of them  we believe that Cisco is a very undervalued blue chip technology stalwart  Furthermore  we believe that there are many reasons that this is the case  but we also believe that none of the reasons are supported by the company s historically low valuation  In other words  we are suggesting that Cisco s fundamentals warrant a much higher valuation than they are currently receiving The following historical earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  tell several interesting stories about this technology bellwether  and perhaps more importantly  the almost bizarre investor psychology that has been applied over the last decade and a half or so  From 1999 until the great recession  investors were willing to price this company at a premium valuation to its earnings justified levels  the orange line on the graph   However  since the fall of 2008  the market has begun valuing Cisco at more realistic earnings justified levels  the price aligned itself with the orange line   However  we believe the pendulum has now swung too far To put this into a clear perspective  we can see by looking at the bottom of the graph that Cisco s earnings continued to grow at above average rates  indicating that Cisco s business has not really changed that much  However  by looking at how the market had overpriced Cisco shares for so many years  it becomes readily apparent that what has changed has been investor attitudes towards the company and its perceived value The following fiscal year end PE ratios that were applied to the company during various fiscal year ends tells the story  At fiscal year end July 31  2000  Cisco s PE ratio was 142  by fiscal year 2002 the PE ratio had fallen to 49  by 2004 Cisco s PE was 29  by 2006 it was 20  by 2008 Cisco s PE ratio was 17 and by fiscal year end 2011 the PE had fallen to just above 12  Currently  Cisco s blended PE ratio hovers around 10  This seems like an awful low valuation for a company that has grown earnings growth of 12 7  per annum Cisco s valuation story becomes even more confusing when you evaluate the company over its more recent history  Since calendar year 2010  the following earnings and price correlating graph shows that Cisco s stock price has steadily fallen  in spite of the fact that their earnings growth post recession has actually accelerated to 14 7  per annum  Moreover  Cisco has sweetened the pot by initiating a dividend that has grown very rapidly since it was first started Summary and ConclusionsAs this article is being written  Cisco shares are trading up over 6   so perhaps the market is beginning to recognize the value in this blue chip technology bellwether  However  even after a 6  increase  we believe that Cisco remains a very undervalued blue chip technology stalwart  Longer term  we are confident that the company will continue to deliver above average earnings growth and with approximately  49 billion in cash  the company s financial profile is impeccable  Consequently  we expect to see a continuing dividend increase in the future We believe there are many drivers fueling the opportunity for Cisco s continued growth going forward  These include more sophisticated utilization of the Internet requiring capacity that Cisco is well positioned to supply  Although Cisco is facing more competition as many startups are bringing innovative new offerings to the market place  Cisco s management appears to be on top of the situation  Consequently  we share the view that Cisco s new product segment will be the primary driver of future growth  Furthermore  we believe there is no other company in the industry that possesses the size and scale that Cisco does to continue to serve its ever expanding market Consequently  we believe that Cisco represents an excellent opportunity for investors seeking a high quality stock with above average growth potential and an above average and growing dividend yield  We see Cisco shares as undervalued relative to their current fundamentals  an even more importantly  relative to their well defined continued long term growth potential  Therefore  we believe that the opportunity to find such a high quality company trading at such a low valuation as Cisco currently is represents a rare opportunity that should not be overlooked Disclosure  Long CSCO at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for

217397,438913,CSCO,High Beta Currencies Benefitting The Most From US Data,opinion,EUR  10 Year Spanish Yields at 2 Month Low GBP  Lifted by Another Piece of Good News CAD  Surprise Decline in Manufacturing Sales NZD  Job Ads Rebound AUD  Slower Consumer Inflation Expectations and Average Wages JPY  Yen Crosses Lifted by Chinese Comments High Beta FX Benefitting the Most from US Data After more than a week of consolidation in the equity market  we are finally beginning to see some action  The S P 500 rose to its highest level in 4 months thanks to stronger earnings from Cisco  CSCO  and improvements in the U S  economy  While yesterday morning s U S  economic reports were mixed with some numbers beating expectations and others missing  most of the data pointed to a continual economic recovery  At some points  this will be positive for the dollar and at others  positive for risk  Yesterday  the price action of the greenback indicated that the recovery is benefitting high beta currencies the most  The greenback traded lower against all of the major currencies except for the Japanese yen  We have been looking for an upside breakout in USD JPY for a few weeks now and finally we are seeing some action  The concurrent rally in the EUR USD  USD JPY and S P 500 confirm that risk appetite has improved over the past 24 hours  Yesterday morning we received more insight into the performance of the housing  manufacturing and labor markets  While every one of yesterday s reports except for building permits surprised to the downside  there was no material deterioration  Jobless claims increased more than anticipated this week and the past week s numbers were revised higher but the increase was too small to raise any eyebrows within the financial sector  In fact  claims were virtually unchanged and still consistent with an addition of 100k or more jobs in the month of August  Continuing claims also dropped to 3 305 million from 3 336 million and the 4  week moving average dipped to 364k from 369k  The housing market numbers on the other hand were mixed with starts falling 1 1  and permits rising 6 8   Starts and permits have been moving in diametrically opposite directions since the beginning of the year suggesting a major disconnect between when builders file applications and break ground on new projects  At the end of the day however  record low mortgage rates are still supporting the housing market with the number of permits filed rising to a 4 year high  Even though housing starts dropped in July  more projects were started last month compared to January  Manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region contracted more than expected in August but the pace of contraction improved with the index rising from  12 9 to  7 1  In light of these improvements  Federal Reserve officials stepped up their opposition to Quantitative Easing  Dallas Fed President Fisher who is not a voting member of the FOMC this year believes that additional stimulus won t have much impact on jobs and may look political  Minneapolis Fed President Kocherlakota didn t talk about Quantitative Easing but said there is room to reduce the interest rate on excess reserves  On Wednesday  Fed President Plosser said he is dubious about the effectiveness of additional bond purchases in lowering the unemployment rate at a faster pace  It is clear that QE3 is a controversial topic with strong supporters and equally strong critics  Therefore unless there is a sharp pullback in the labor market or another near death experience in Europe  QE3 will be shelved for the time being  EUR  10 Year Spanish Yields at 2 Month Low The euro traded higher against the U S  dollar but unlike other major currency pairs such as USD JPY and GBP USD  yesterday s move did not take the EUR USD to a fresh monthly high  Instead  the currency pair remains trapped within its 1 5 week trading range of 1 2240 and 1 2440  Reassuring comments from German Chancellor Merkel lent support to the euro  In a speech made during her trip to Canada  Merkel reiterated her pledge to  do everything we can in order to maintain the common currency   In other words  the Germans will fight tooth and nail to defend the euro but hopefully it won t come to that  While the EUR USD remains very weak  the recent stabilization in the currency is a big relief to policymakers  The fact that 10 year Spanish bond yields also dropped to their lowest level in more than 2 months yesterday is music to their ears  Consumer prices were the only piece of eurozone economic data released yesterday and EUR USD traders were completely unfazed by the sharp decline in inflationary pressures  CPI fell 0 5 percent in July  marking the third consecutive month of lower prices  Accelerated budget cuts and increasing job losses in the region forced retailers to cut prices to attract demand  The ECB won t be too worried however because on an annualized basis  CPI rose from 1 6  to 1 7   Overall  muted inflationary pressures in eurozone leave room for further easing from the ECB  if needed  German producer prices and Eurozone trade numbers are scheduled for release on Friday  GBP  Lifted by Another Piece of Good News  The British pound rose against the U S  dollar but weakened against the euro  The big story in Europe was the sharp increase in U K  consumer consumption last month  Retail sales rose 0 3 percent in July and the icing on the cake was the sharp upward revision to the June numbers from 0 1  to 0 8   While retail sales ex autos were flat  the market was looking for much weaker consumer spending numbers and for this reason Q2 GDP forecasts could be revised higher  Retail sales should continue to rise in August thanks to the improvement in the labor market and spending around the Olympics  This week s economic reports were overwhelmingly positive for the British pound  Inflationary pressures increased more than expected in July  the number of people filing for unemployment benefits dropped by 5 9k and consumer spending beat expectations  While the Bank of England is still open to the idea of more stimulus  the latest numbers will give them the flexibility to hold monetary policy steady at their next meeting in September  No U K  economic reports are due for release today CAD  Surprise Decline in Manufacturing Sales The Canadian  Australia and New Zealand dollars strengthened against the greenback yesterday  Canadian manufacturing sales unexpectedly declined by 0 4  in June and was forecasted to increase by 0 3   Manufacturing sales declined in four of the past 6 months  Sales of petroleum and coal products fell 10 6  in June  Although manufacturing sales had dismal reports  if petroleum and coal was excluded  sales rose by 1 1   Petroleum and coal took a toll in June from lower prices and factory shutdowns  Canadian stocks rallied as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao signaled China may cut banks  reserve requirements or interest rates after inflation slowed to 30 month low in July  In other news  German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Canada s budget model for prospering without  living on borrowed money   Merkel hopes to replicate Canada s debt deficit model  Canadian consumer prices are due for release on Friday  Of the 3 commodity currencies  the New Zealand dollar was the best performer yesterday thanks in large part to a rebound in job ads  Manufacturing activity however contracted last month  offsetting some of the upside surprise  JPY  Yen Crosses Lifted by Chinese Comments The Japanese yen weakened against all of the major traded currencies yesterday  It has been another quiet day in Japan with no new market moving data on the calendar  Asians stocks rose with the Nikkei 225 Index up by 1 88   167 71 points  to 9 092 76 after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao signaled the possibility of easing  He said there s  growing room for monetary policy operation  and  we have conditions and capabilities  and will be sure to fulfill this year s economic and social development targets   Wen also said that slowing inflation will allow more room to adjust monetary policy in the world s second largest economy  Inflation slowed to a 30
