138835,360350,DGX,Is Quest Diagnostics Stock a Buy ,news,"Quest Diagnostics  NYSE DGX  is a leading global diagnostics company and an attractive option for those who want a safer way to invest in the healthcare industry  With a market cap of around  14 billion  it isn t the largest healthcare company  But it has made a name for itself working with many big organizations over the years  currently serving about half of the hospitals and doctors in the U S 
Over the past 12 months  the stock has risen 24   slightly underperforming the S P 500 s returns of 26  during that time  But with Quest s share price up around 52 week highs  it may be an expensive stock to own today  Let s take a closer look to see whether it s still a good buy or if investors should wait for a dip in its share price 
Good results  but growth is hard to come by
In October  Quest released its third quarter results  which beat expectations for both sales and profits  In addition  the company also raised its outlook for the remainder of the year  Quest is expecting its top line to come in at  7 72 billion for the full year  While that s higher than the midpoint of its previous range  it would be just 2 5  higher than 2018 s tally of  7 53 billion in revenue  

Although Quest lost exclusivity with Aetna in 2019  it has since become a preferred provider for UnitedHealth  which has allowed it to produce some better than expected results  The company noted that having greater access has been key to its improved performance this year 
While Quest has an excellent presence in the market today  finding more growth may be a challenge  In recent years  the company hasn t shown much growth  with its revenue fluctuating between  7 5 billion and  7 7 billion since 2016  Profits have also been volatile during that time  ranging between  645 million and  772 million 
For a growth investor  it may be difficult to get excited about investing in Quest given the lack of progress in the company s top line 
Does the dividend sweeten the deal 
Currently  Quest pays its shareholders a quarterly dividend of  0 53  which comes out to an annual yield of 1 99   That s slightly better than the average 1 85  investors can earn with the S P 500  But without the same level of diversification that the index offers and growth prospects not looking any stronger  convincing investors that Quest is the better dividend option will be no easy task 
The good news is that investors who hang on to shares of Quest for a long time could see their payouts rise  Five years ago  the company was paying its shareholders a dividend of  0 33 every quarter  Quest has hiked its payouts by more than 60  since then  averaging a compounded annual growth rate of 9 9  during that time  If Quest were to continue raising its dividend payments at that rate  investors would see their dividend payments double after a little more than seven years of holding onto the shares 
Why Quest isn t a buy today
There s nothing wrong with Quest s business  as the company is producing strong  consistent numbers  The problem is that there s not enough growth  If a stock offers little in the way of growth  dividends can make up for that with a good and growing yield  While Quest has been increasing its payouts  at a dividend yield of around 2  per year  there are simply more attractive dividend stocks available for investors  money today   not to mention healthcare stocks 
Trading near its high and at a price to earnings multiple of 20  Quest is a bit expensive for a stock that has generated little to no growth in recent years  A PEG ratio of more than 3 also suggests there just isn t enough growth in the company s future to justify its current valuation  Generally  investors normally look for a PEG of 1 or less to indicate a good growth buy  
Investors should keep an eye out on Quest in case the stock falls and becomes a cheaper buy  But for now  the stock just doesn t offer enough value  growth  or dividends to make it an attractive investment today ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkytw,2064180
138836,360351,DGX,Quest Diagnostics Buys Blueprint Genetics to Help It Read Mountains of DNA Data,news,"Quest Diagnostics  NYSE DGX  runs medical tests on one in three American adults each year  and there are treasure chests full of medical insights buried in the mountains of genetic data some of those tests generate  To help analyze and interpret all the sequenced genetic data that piles up  Quest recently acquired a privately held company called Blueprint Genetics for an undisclosed sum  
All roads lead to Helsinki 
Quest Diagnostics is best known for processing the most commonly performed laboratory tests  but it has lots of capable competition in that niche  a condition that can quickly squeeze profit margins  So it s rapidly building a slate of next generation DNA sequencing services to add to its menu of advanced diagnostic services  Blueprint will give it a greater capacity to interpret the results  

In the seven years since its founding  Blueprint Genetics has grown  into a global leader in the genetic diagnostics business  with customers in more than 70 countries  It s has a North American base of operations in Seattle  but Quest plans to allow it to continue operating independently from its headquarters in Helsinki  Finland 
New revenue streams
Thousands of diseases caused by genetic mutations affect an estimated 30 million Americans  and developing the first FDA approved tests for one after another is a great way to stay a step ahead of the competition  
The diagnostics business is extremely competitive  and depending too heavily on any single revenue stream isn t healthy  Quest Diagnostics is eager to build out its gene based service offerings  and Blueprint s ability to interpret the data generated by genetic testing on a mass scale could expand its new owner s menu by leaps and bounds ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plijl,2065344

The five organizations will test blockchain to see whether it could ensure high accuracy in data sharing  streamline administrative processes  and provide better access to care 
Currently  physicians  managed care organizations  diagnostic service providers  and other healthcare system players store separate data sets  This can often result in errors and significant differences in information  Blockchain would enable a unified platform where data can be held securely and accessed by trusted entities under certain conditions  It can also reduce maintenance costs  Today  about  2 1 billion is spent each year on maintaining provider data 
Michael Jacobs  senior distinguished engineer at Optum  said in a message to Cryptovest that the pilot would run over the summer and the first results are expected in the fall  Based on the outcomes  the group will determine whether to continue with blockchain implementation 
Jacobs explained how patients could benefit from the blockchain adoption 

 Patients may see improved quality in the provider directories  enabling them to seek care more quickly and efficiently  Provider data is an essential part of today s health system  feeding many activities such as claims and payment processing  Having more accurate data could equate to less time spent on these activities for stakeholders across the system  

David Murtagh  VP of operations at MultiPlan  revealed that the company was excited to take part in the pilot and consolidate its relationships with the alliance members 

  We re looking forward to exploring how blockchain technology can make the process more efficient while reducing costs  ideally to build investments that can enhance the provider and patient experiences   Murtagh said 

MultiPlan is a New York based company that provides healthcare cost management solutions  It leverages innovative technologies and data analysis tools to help healthcare payers manage the cost of care 
According to Pam Walker  senior director of MultiPlan s marketing   communication  the experiment aims to  uniformly measure the quality and cost implications of sharing provider demographic changes across a permissioned blockchain  

 We expect patients to benefit from access to the most accurate  up to date provider information through the pilot program   she told Cryptovest via email 

According to the second round of online provider directory reviews carried out by Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  52  of the provider directory locations listed had at least one inaccuracy  like an incorrect phone number  physical address  or a provider s availability  as noted by Walker

138947,360462,DGX,DGX Or ADUS  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Outpatient and Home Healthcare sector have probably already heard of Quest Diagnostics  DGX  and Addus HomeCare  ADUS   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Quest Diagnostics and Addus HomeCare are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
DGX currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 80  while ADUS has a forward P E of 32 83  We also note that DGX has a PEG ratio of 2 09  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ADUS currently has a PEG ratio of 2 12 
Another notable valuation metric for DGX is its P B ratio of 2 54  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ADUS has a P B of 3 30 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DGX s Value grade of B and ADUS s Value grade of C 
Both DGX and ADUS are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that DGX is the superior value option right now ",2020-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dgx-or-adus-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200498737,200498737
138948,360463,DGX,Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Quest Diagnostics  DGX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 7

Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quest Diagnostics 
For Quest Diagnostics  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quest Diagnostics will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Quest Diagnostics would post earnings of  1 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 76  delivering a surprise of  2 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

138977,360492,DGX,All You Need To Know About Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Quest Diagnostics  DGX   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Quest Diagnostics basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Quest Diagnostics imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Quest Diagnostics
This medical laboratory operator is expected to earn  6 50 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 3  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Quest Diagnostics  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

138998,360513,DGX,Earnings Preview  Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Quest Diagnostics  DGX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 94 billion  up 1 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quest Diagnostics 
For Quest Diagnostics  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quest Diagnostics will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Quest Diagnostics would post earnings of  1 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 40  delivering a surprise of  2 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line

That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

139001,360516,DGX,Outlook For Outpatient And Home Healthcare Industry Looks Bright,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises of companies that provide ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home  These companies utilize advanced medical technologies for diagnosis  observation  consultation  treatment and rehabilitation services The industry participants also include operators of HMO medical centers  kidney dialysis centers  freestanding ambulatory surgical units  emergency centers and other outpatient care centers Here are the three major industry themes Cost Effectiveness   Favorable Demographics  The primary advantage of the outpatient clinics is cost effectiveness  The outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours  overnight  or charge exorbitantly  Notably  modern day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options  and even minor surgical procedures  Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower cost care settings are also responsible for the growth in outpatient care  This is the primary reason behind middle class Americans  making up more than 62  of the total population  preferring outpatient clinic visits  The industry should also benefit from the rising geriatric population  growing prevalence of chronic diseases and reduction of burden for healthcare sector owing to substantial decline in the daily patient admissions  Drug Rehabilitation Centers See Rising Demand  Americans are increasingly getting addicted to a variety of drugs  which is affecting health and family to a large extent  This is where outpatient rehabs will come into play since the treatment they provide is comparatively cheaper than the inpatient and residential units  Further  the recent national epidemic of  Youth Opioid Abuse  is likely to drive demand for outpatient rehab centers   In this regard  MedTech behemoth DaVita Inc  DVA  deserves a mention  In 2017  The Everett Clinic  a division of DaVita  received the Washington State Medical Association s  WSMA  highest award for patient safety in the category of excellence for its chronic opioid therapy work  AI s Dominant Role  Artificial intelligence or AI has been a roaring success in healthcare  taking the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm as well  Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information  With the help of AI  hospitals will achieve better outcomes  while patients will receive more efficient and personalized care  The outpatient industry has been churning out huge profits from Electronic Health Records  Revenue Cycle Management  eLabs  ePrescriptions and many more  Notably  Quest Diagnostics   DGX  Quanum solutions unit is an AI platform that streamlines 20 billion laboratory data test results and other health information for population health management and clinical care Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe

year The industry has lost 22 5  over this period compared with the S P 500 s decline of 1 6   Meanwhile  the broader sector fell 11 9  in the same timeframe One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s

139025,360540,DGX,Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Quest Diagnostics  DGX  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 36 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 88 billion  down 0 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 64  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quest Diagnostics 
For Quest Diagnostics  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 74  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Quest Diagnostics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Quest Diagnostics would post earnings of  1 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 36  delivering no surprise 
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

139052,360567,DGX,Earnings Preview  Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Quest Diagnostics  DGX  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 36 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 88 billion  down 2 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quest Diagnostics 
For Quest Diagnostics  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 96  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quest Diagnostics will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Quest Diagnostics would post earnings of  1 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 68  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Quest Diagnostics doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-quest-diagnostics-dgx-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200385149,200385149
139053,360568,DGX,Can M A Activity Drive Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Quest Diagnostics Incorporated   NYSE DGX   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 earnings before the opening bell on Feb 14 In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  average trailing four quarter beat was delivered at 0 18  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayOn a positive note  Quest Diagnostics seems well aligned with its agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence  Per its new long term progress outlook  revenue increase for the period 2017 2020 is expected to be 3 5  with 1 2  rise projected from acquisitions  Earnings for the period are anticipated to surge faster than the top line in the mid to high single  digit range Per the company  its frequently growing partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions are creating promising opportunities for the top and the bottom line while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care In third quarter 2018  the company satisfied all five elements of the above mentioned growth agenda and strongly expects this momentum to continue  going forward Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Going by the first constituent of the growth strategy  to increase top line improvement by 1 2  through strategically accretive acquisitions   the company is supposed to complete three advantageously aligned  accretive buyouts in the fourth quarter 2018  namely PhenoPath  the U S  laboratory services business of Oxford Immunotec and ReproSource These transactions are likely to garner favorable results in the to be reported quarter  The company earlier expected to see about 250 basis points of growth from M As in 2018 Accounting for the second element of the company s key growth plans  which is to expand relationships with hospital health systems  Quest Diagnostics along with four other leading health care organizations  namely Humana  NYSE HUM   MultiPlan  UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  Group s Optum and UnitedHealthcare launched a pilot program last year  applying blockchain technology to enhance data quality and lower administrative costs associated with changes to health care provider demographic data Considering the third component of the company s strategic growth schemes that offers the broadest access to diagnostic innovation  principal growth catalysts in the third quarter were prescription drug monitoring  QuantiFERON  tuberculosis test and non invasive prenatal screening  We are also optimistic about the company s successful execution of its intent to build an esoteric testing business and boost profitability This apart  according to the company  the recently inked acquisition deals are projected o upgrade its capabilities in advanced diagnostics  especially in the areas of Women s Health and Infectious Disease About the fourth element of the company s growth strategy  which is to provide ample choices to consumers  the company s relationship with Walmart  NYSE WMT  has already started adding value to this end with higher patient traffic  Besides  the company s alliance with Safeway is predicted to have more than 200 patient service centers at retail store locations by 2018 end  This positive aspect will probably get reflected in fourth quarter earnings performance The fifth element of Quest Diagnostics  growth policy is to support population health within analytics and extended care services  In this regard  the company recently launched Quest Clinical Trial Connect  a patient recruitment service Also  the company s tactic to steer operating efficiency is on track  Quest Diagnostics has been converting to electronic requisition and has begun digitalized pick up through Quanum HCP Portal and is winning 200 clients each week  These efforts are directed to propel operational excellence for meeting the cost of wage inflation and reimbursement pressure We expect these active growth drivers to replicate the company s success story in its upcoming quarterly results  Also  the performance is likely to push up the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter We strongly believe  all these recent developments might have significantly contributed to the company s top line in the fourth quarter On the flip side  Quest Diagnostics witnessed lower than expected growth in prescription drug monitoring marketplace due to policy changes opposed by some payers to restrict testing in the last reported quarter  The company also bore the brunt of a rapid decline in genotyping and resistance testing in the hepatitis C market  At the same time  revenues from vitamin D testing softened on account of rising reimbursement rejections Overall  excluding the impact of amortization expense  adjusted EPS for 2018 is forecast within  6 53  6 60  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 33 is below the guided range  Revenues for the full year are envisioned at around  7 62 billion  marking annualized growth of roughly 3   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  7 58 billion falls short of the company s assumed figure What Our Model SuggestsOur proven Zacks model clearly indicates that a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank  4  which decreases the predictive power of ESP  and an Earnings ESP of  1 96   a combination that does not conclusively show an earnings beat for the stock  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 36 reflects a 1 45  decline on a year over year basis We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks

139119,360634,DGX,3 Medical ETFs   Stocks Prescribed On Health Day,opinion,"This year  March April period may be jinxed for the broader market hurt by a tech crash and trade war fears between China and the United States  While the tech crash has eased  U S  China trade war fears seem to have reached its optimum level to start Q2  Thus  some value and safer picks are best bets at the current level  And what can be a better pick than healthcare ETFs 
Healthcare stocks are seen as relatively defensive and can provide safety to one s portfolio during market downturns  like we have seen this year  This makes the healthcare sector look better this World Health Day on Apr 7 
While ebbing fears related to price gouging  a flurry of positive clinical trials  increasing health care spending and decent valuation are the wind beneath the wings  tax cuts and an uptick in M A are the special favorable factors this year 
Tax Reform 
If these were not enough  tax reform is going to prove to be a big boon to the sector  Per  on Reuters  domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services are likely to benefit from the lower tax rate and generate superior cash flows  These companies have limited international exposure and considerable capital expenditures 
Plus  Mizuho Securities indicated that  hospital operator Universal Health Services Inc  NYSE UHS   lab testing company Quest Diagnostics  NYSE DGX  Inc and drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc  NYSE CAH  are among the service companies  are poised to benefit  read    
Many large drugmakers hold a huge overseas cash balance and a one time repatriation tax would help them to bring back cash stacked abroad  This in turn could boost more dividend payments or cash repurchase activities 
M A
The U S  healthcare supply chain is consolidating fast  with  ranging from insurers  pharmacies to drug distributors  Global M A activity hit a  high in the first quarter of 2018 on jumbo U S  health care deals  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  s foray into pharmaceuticals and the Cigna Express Scripts transaction in Q1 deserve a mention in this context 
According to  on Bloomberg  smaller insurers like WellCare Health Plans Inc    NYSE WCG    Centene Corp    NYSE CNC     Molina Healthcare Inc    NYSE MOH   and Obamacare focused startup Oscar Insurance Corp  appear to be lucrative acquisition targets now

On the other hand  high installation cost of breast imaging systems  side effects of radiation exposure and errors in breast cancer screening and diagnosis are impeding the global breast imaging market 
This market is dominated by well established players  Quest Diagnostics  NYSE DGX  being the most prominent one  Quest Diagnostics  Quest Vantage services help discover genetic variants related to the hereditary risk of 15 types of cancer  including breast  colorectal  pancreatic and renal

139175,360690,DGX,Is Quest Diagnostics  DGX  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Quest Diagnostics Inc    NYSE DGX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Quest Diagnostics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 stands at about 20 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Quest Diagnostics  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having fallen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Quest Diagnostics has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 22 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Quest Diagnostics stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Quest Diagnostics has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DGX is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Quest Diagnostics currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Quest Diagnostics a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Quest Diagnostics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C  This gives DGX a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen thirteen up in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineQuest Diagnostics is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 22  of more than 250 industries  instills investor confidence  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the markets  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks

Revenues in the region increased 6  on a year over year basis at cc  Health Care Services revenues from the EMEA segment increased 5  at cc on a year over year basis  Health Care Products revenues rose 7  at cc in the third quarter 
The Health Care Services segment was primarily driven by growth in same market treatments  partially offset by a decline in organic revenue per treatment  Meanwhile  Health Care products primarily gained from a 4  year over year hike in Dialysis product revenues

Major Q3 Highlights
Fresenius Buys NxStage Medical
In an initiative to boost its long term  Growth Strategy 2020   Fresenius signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage Medical   NASDAQ NXTM   for  30 a share in August  The transaction has been valued at  2 billion and is subject to close by 2018 
Fresenius expects the acquisition to prove accretive to earnings within three years from deal closure  Furthermore  the deal is expected to provide annual pretax cost savings of  80 million to  100 million over the next three to five years  Fresenius also expects integration costs of about  150 million over the next three years from the time of announcement  Per management  the takeover will boost revenues at the Care Coordination segment  read more    
Divestment of Shiel Medical Laboratory
In an initiative to optimize its portfolio  Fresenius announced the divestiture of its Shiel Medical unit to Quest Diagnostics   NYSE DGX   in September  Notably  Shiel is a clinical laboratory provider primarily focusing on non renal lab services  The lab specifically serves in the New York New Jersey metropolitan area  Management at Fresinius expects the transaction to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 
Post the deal closure  Quest Diagnostics and Fresenius will jointly work on identifying patients with early stage chronic kidney disease  with potential to benefit from treatment to slow progression to end stage renal disease  ESRD   based on the former s laboratory data analytics  read more    
Guidance
For full year 2017  Fresenius reiterated its guidance  The company estimates revenue growth of 8 10  at cc  Net income attributable to shareholders is likely to increase around 7 9  
Our Take
Fresenius ended the third quarter on a dismal note missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts  However  the company reiterated its full year guidance  We believe this is in tune with the  Growth Strategy 2020   under which it aims to boost revenues to  28 billion by 2020  corresponding to an average annual growth rate of around 10  
A wide range of dialysis products  initiatives to gain market traction  strengthen international foothold  strategic acquisitions and divestments act as major catalysts for the company  However  a lackluster performance by the renal pharmaceutical unit is likely to dent Latin American revenues  Having a strong international foothold  Fresenius faces a highly regulated environment in almost every country in which it operates 
Furthermore  the company has to fulfill specific legal requirements that include tough antitrust regulations  Thus  regulatory hurdles and competition in the niche markets are major headwinds

139178,360693,DGX,Quest Diagnostics  Clinical Genomics Ally  Oncology Strong,opinion,"Quest Diagnostics Inc    NYSE DGX   and Clinical Genomics  a major player in the field of colorectal cancer detection  jointly announced the FDA clearance of the latter s InSure ONE 
With the FDA approval  Quest Diagnostics will make InSure ONE available to its broad base of physicians  organized provider groups and Accountable Care Organizations  ACOs  across the United States  InSure ONE is expected to be commercially available in early 2018  This development will remain a part of Quest Diagnostics  consistent effort to successfully pave its way through the growing field of cancer diagnostics 
As a useful at home collection fecal immunochemical test  FIT   InSure ONE improves compliance for screening programs  Among other InSure FIT tests  InSure ONE detects human hemoglobin from blood in fecal samples to aid in the detection of lower gastrointestinal bleeding  While other FIT tests require two samples  InSure ONE needs just a single specimen to run the screening successfully 
Given the fact that FIT has been accepted as the guideline recommended for screening programs for an early detection of adenomatous polyps  precursors to cancer and colorectal cancer  in individuals of average risk starting at age 50 years   the role of InSure FIT tests is gaining more importance by the day  Considering this situation  both the companies view that this uncomplicated procedure of InSure ONE may better fix the problem of patient non participation for screening programs as well 
The latest strategic development with Clinical Genomics is in sync with Quest Diagnostics  goal to gain a leadership position in the high potential global oncology diagnostic market  Notably  Quest Diagnostics has recently acquired Med Fusion and Clear Point forming a national precision oncology center of expertise  
Per the data provided by American Cancer Society  nearly 1 7 million people are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in the United States by the end of 2017  Also  per Markets and Markets  the global cancer diagnostics market is expected to reach a level worth  13 1 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 12 9  during 2015 2020  Accordingly  we are upbeat about a promising customer adoption rate of InSure ONE down the line

139205,360720,DGX,Top Stock Reports For McDonald s  3M   Stryker ,opinion,"Wednesday July 26 2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including McDonald s  MCD   3M  MMM  and Stryker  SYK   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated McDonald s  shares have gained  28 9  over the last six months easily outperforming many of its peers which have been struggling to survive the restaurant space s tough operating environment lately  McDonald s Q2 earnings and revenues exceeded expectations  but revenues fell year over year mainly due to the impact of refranchising 
Meanwhile  the company recorded the eighth consecutive quarter of global comps growth  In fact  McDonald s grew sales and guest counts in each of its top nine markets  for the first time since 2008  The Zacks analyst likes McDonald s attempts to reinforce its position worldwide via various sales and digital initiatives 
Also  increased focus on refranchising is expected to reduce its capital requirements  thereby facilitating EPS growth and ROE expansion in the long run  Yet  higher costs along with currency headwinds may hurt profits while a soft industry backdrop in the U S  and macroeconomic concerns in some parts of the world might limit sales growth 
 You can 
3M s shares are up  12 4  in the year to date period  outperforming the S P 500 index  up  10 8   and the Zacks Conglomerates sector  down  1 4    Driven by broad based organic growth across all segments  3M reported strong second quarter results with healthy year over year increase in earnings and revenues  although it missed expectations on both counts 
The company has raised its earlier guidance for 2017 on strong quarterly results and improved business outlook  The Zacks analyst likes 3M s global footprint  diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets  However  increased pension expenses remain a significant headwind for 3M and erode its profitability 
Sustained strength in the U S  dollar will further continue to negatively impact earnings  as exports consume a significant part of the company s operations and growth prospects  Given its international presence  adverse foreign currency translations are also likely to affect 3M s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings 
 You can  
Stryker s shares have gained  18 5  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has gained  17 8  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Stryker s performance is likely to be affected by supply side headwinds  The company has been grappling with issues in its spine business for long and this is expected to affect performance in the second quarter 
China might prove to be a challenging market for the company  Additionally  challenging global economic conditions and rising competition raise concerns  Estimate movement has also been mixed ahead of its second quarter earnings release  However growing adoption of MAKO will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market  The acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio Control and the tie up with Indo UK Institute of Health s Medicity Program are also major positives

Operational Update
Adjusted consolidated revenues of  13 48 billion grew 4  on higher Retail segment revenues from the company s Medicare business  excluding the impact of revenues from the company s Individual Commercial business  In spite the year over year increase  however  revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 6 billion Humana s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 85 2   deteriorated 20 basis points  bps  from the prior year quarter  primarily due to lower Prior Period Development  margin compression due to stiff competition in the Group Medicare Advantage business  and suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017  This was  however  partially offset by planned exits from certain Medicare Advantage markets with higher benefit ratio than other markets 
Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 10 7  improved 150 bps from the year ago quarter  primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017 
Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail Segment
Revenues from the Retail segment were  11 43 billion  up 5  year over year  primarily owing to higher revenues from the company s Medicare Advantage business  This in turn was driven by increased membership as well as higher per member premiums for the individual Medicare Advantage and state based contract businesses 
Benefit ratio for the Retail segment of 88 1  improved 50 bps year over year  primarily due to planned exits from certain Medicare Advantage markets with higher benefit ratio than other markets and the seasonal impact of leap day in the first quarter 2016 versus none in the current quarter The Retail segment s operating cost ratio of 8 4  improved 150 bps year over year due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017 
Adjusted pretax income for the Retail segment of  376 million soared 156  year over year  primarily due to lower benefit and operating cost ratios 
Group Segment
Revenues from the Group and Specialty segment were  1 88 billion  up 2  from the prior year quarter  primarily due to an increase in group fully insured commercial medical per member premiums  partially offset by declines in average group fully insured and ASO commercial medical membership 
Benefit ratio for the Group and Specialty segment deteriorated 200 bps year over year to 75 6   due to lower Prior Period Development  suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017 and an increased proportion of small group members in community rated plans with higher benefit ratio 
Operating cost ratio improved 210 bps year over year to 21 4   primarily due to suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017 and operating cost efficiencies 
Adjusted pretax income of  172 million decreased 1  year over year due to an increase in the segment s benefit ratio  largely offset by improvement in the segment s operating cost ratio 
Healthcare Services
Revenues of  5 96 decreased 4  year over year  primarily due to the company s Pharmacy Solutions business as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with the company s chronic condition management programs 
Operating cost ratio remained flat year over year at 95 5  
Adjusted pretax income for the segment was  255 million  down 3  year over year due to the reduction in pharmacy revenues  offset by a similar reduction in operating costs ratio 
Individual Commercial Segment
Individual Commercial membership was0 2 million as of Mar 31  2017  down 77  year over year  primarily due to a decline in number of counties where the company offers on exchange coverage as well as the discontinuance of off exchange products 
Benefit ratio for the Individual Commercial segment was 55 1  as against 81 6  in first quarter 2016  primarily due to planned exits from certain markets with higher benefit ratio than other markets and per member premium increases 
The segment s operating cost ratio deteriorated 300 bps from  the year ago quarter to 21 9   primarily due to reduced leverage from market exits in 2017  partially offset by the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017 
The company witnessed a pretax income of  63 million  which compared favorably with a pretax loss of  12 million in the prior quarter  This was owing to the exit from certain markets in 2017 and per member premium increases Humana Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

As of Mar 31  2017  cash and short term investments held by the parent company was  1 71 billion  down 15  from Dec 31  2016  This was primarily due to the payment of  1 50 billion for the company s accelerated share repurchase program in Mar 2017 and a capital contribution of  535 million to the company s long term care subsidiary 
Debt to total capitalization as of Mar 31  2017 was 33 9   up 620 bps from year end  2016  This was primarily due to higher debt balance associated with the company s recent debt issuance 
Cash flows from operations totaled  1 1 billion compared with cash flow from operations of  502 million in the prior year quarter  Cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by the receipt of the merger termination fees  net of related expenses  and higher earnings  This was partially offset by working capital changes Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateIn Feb 2017  Humana s board of directors approved a  2 25 billion share repurchase authorization  which expired on Dec 31  2017

139285,360800,DGX,Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Q3 Earnings  A Surprise In Store ,opinion,Quest Diagnostics Inc    NYSE DGX   is scheduled to report third quarter 2016 earnings results before the opening bell on Oct 20  2016 Last quarter  the company posted in line earnings  It is worth noting that Quest Diagnostics has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 0 77   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayWith the last reported results  Quest Diagnostics saw the seventh consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth at an increasing rate  This also marked the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue per requisition growth in the last three years  It was a huge improvement from the 2  organic revenue decline in 2014 and subsequently  we remain optimistic about the company s performance in the second half of 2016 The upside was backed by the successful execution of the company s strategy to grow its esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth  This trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter as well Over the recent past  Quest Diagnostics has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing  prescription drug monitoring and industry leading wellness business  We expect these growth drivers to be active through the third quarter as well  benefiting the same metrics as in the preceding one QUEST DIAGNOSTC Price and Consensus   This includes three new cancer test services that will provide clinically actionable insight into an individual s risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer  These tests will remain part of the company s newly branded Quest Vantage cancer test menu Additionally  last month  the company announced the launch of Zika Antibody Test Service based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s  CDC  Zika MAC ELISA  Notably  Quest Diagnostics was the first commercial laboratory to receive FDA emergency use authorization for a Zika test for the qualitative detection of RNA from Zika virus in human serum specimens We are also looking forward to the company s alliance with HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare   NYSE HCA   to improve the quality and value of diagnostic services  Per the agreement  Quest Diagnostics will manage in patient laboratory operations for six Denver area hospitals in the HealthONE system Additionally  noteworthy are the company s partnerships with information and technology enabled health services business Optum  Sep 2016   and leading food and drug retailer Safeway  Jun 2016   Notably  Safeway s alliance enabled Quest Diagnostics to offer diagnostic testing in 12 Safeway locations in Arizona through Quest s Sonora Quest Laboratories joint venture with Banner Health  Last month  Quest Diagnostics announced the opening of six new Sonora Quest Laboratories Patient Service Centers  PSCs  throughout Arizona We believe all these recent developments will significantly contribute to the company s top line in the third quarter  In addition  several new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks were the other growth drivers On the flip side we note that over the last two years  Quest Diagnostics has faced multiple reimbursement issues that affected its revenues  The company is highly disappointed with the recent CMS  Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act  PAMA   While reimbursement pressure will remain a moderate headwind even in the upcoming period  the company expects to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix Also  it still remains a big question whether the volume improvement in recent times is sustainable  We should take into consideration that price headwinds persisted in the quarter   down slightly less than 1   Further  Professional Lab Services  Barnabas Health and HCA carried lower revenue per requisition The company currently expects full year revenues in the range of  7 47  7 54 billion compared to the earlier range of  7 52  7 59 billion  reflecting flat to 1  increase over 2015 revenues  growth of 1 5  2 5    In addition  the company s 2016 adjusted EPS expectation remains in the range of  5 02  5 17  unchanged from the previous expectation   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 10 remains within the guided range Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   That is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are at  1 35 Zacks Rank  Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are two companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Edwards Lifesciences Corp    NYSE EW   has an Earnings ESP of  2 94  and a Zacks Rank  2 ICU Medical  Inc    NASDAQ ICUI   has an Earnings ESP of  6 32  and a Zacks Rank  2 You can

Further  its recent deal  May 2016  with HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare   NYSE HCA   to enhance the quality and value of diagnostic services is also worth mentioning  Per the agreement  Quest Diagnostics will manage in patient laboratory operations for six Denver area hospitals in the HealthONE system 
We believe all these recent developments will start to contribute to the company s top line from the second quarter itself  In addition  several new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks were the other growth drivers 
On the flip side we note that  over the last two years  Quest Diagnostics has faced multiple reimbursement issues that affected its revenues  The company is highly disappointed with the recent CMS  Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act  PAMA   While reimbursement pressure will remain a moderate headwind even in the upcoming period  the company expects to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix 
The company currently expects its full year 2016 revenues in the range of  7 52  7 59 billion  reflecting annualized growth of 1 5  2 5   In addition  the company s 2016 adjusted EPS expectation  excluding amortization expense  has been declared in the range of  5 02  5 17 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   That is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are at  1 12 
Zacks Rank  Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are two companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
AmSurg Corp    NASDAQ AMSG   has an Earnings ESP of  0 98  and a Zacks Rank  2

its performance in the second quarter Within the Healthcare sector  health insurers are expected to see top line growth on an increase in member enrollment  The Government business which includes Medicare and Medicaid will likely see a surge in enrollment  Also  ancillary businesses which are outside the purview of the Health Care Reform Act will likely see higher earnings While diversified product offerings and expansion into international markets are likely to have beefed up revenues  cost management should give the bottom line a boost However  healthcare companies continued to face pressure from pricing  regulatory compliance costs  rising medical costs and competition Another sub segment providing laboratory and diagnostic services is expected to see earnings accretion as the

sector are resorting to tactical approaches to restore improvement in sales and marketing excellence  development of esoteric testing through a disease focus  partnerships with hospitals  creation of

quarter  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 59  and a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 1 89 per share We expect the bottom line at UnitedHealth to benefit from a decline in operating cost ratio due to the combination of business mix and technology driven operational efficiencies  These efficiency gains will be partially offset by continued investments in
