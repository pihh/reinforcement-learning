180408,401924,TPR,StockBeat  Burberry Warns of Major Sales Impact from Virus,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    Slowly but surely  the coronavirus is coming to European companies 
Fashion group Burberry fell 1 8  on Friday after giving its first detailed update on the impact of the virus on sales in China  The news isn t pretty  Nearly half of its stores on the mainland are closed  and the rest are operating reduced hours  Overall footfall is down as much as 80   according to chief financial officer Julie Brown  who told the Financial Times that the impact on Hong Kong sales is worse than that of the prolonged civil unrest in the former British colony 
Given that 40  of Burberry s sales are generated in Asia Pacific  the region that captures not only China itself but most Chinese tourist spending   the consequences are unavoidable 
CEO Marco Gobbetti said in a statement that the outbreak is having  a material negative effect on luxury demand    an assessment shared on Thursday by Tapestry  NYSE TPR   the owner of the Kate Spade and   Coach   brands  The company wasn t able to be any more specific  but it seems clear that prior consensus of 4  organic sales growth for the 12 months through March now seems unreachable  Burberry shares fell as much as 4 5  in early trading before rebounding to be down 1 8  by 5 30 AM ET  1030 GMT   The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0 3  while the FTSE 100 was down 0 6 
Luxury stocks  with their comparatively high direct exposure to Asian consumption  were among the first sector to be hit by the virus  Burberry  for example is down 15  in the last three weeks  Airlines and tourism related companies were also hit in the first wave 
But there are increasing signs that the much predicted disruptions to global supply chains are now starting to bite  Fiat Chrysler warned on Thursday that it may have to suspend production at one of its European plants due to the lack of components from one critical supplier in China  Volvo and PSA Group have also warned about such threats 
To be sure  the news is not all negative  The overall rate of new cases continues to slow  according to the official data  while the growth rate of fatal incidences also slowing down  even though the absolute death toll is now fast closing in on the SARS epidemic   Honda Motor said earlier Friday that it will restart production at its plant in Wuhan  the epicenter of the outbreak  on Feb  17 
Moreover  not all companies   even those present in China   are affected equally  L Oreal shares opened at a record high on Friday  before retreating later  after the cosmetics group said it expects only a temporary hit to Asian sales  The fact that L Oreal sells more of its stuff online  rather than depending on footfall at boutiques in specific locations  is a big help in that regard 
However  the emergence of reports out of China about its treatment of whistleblowers   including Li Wenliang  a Wuhan doctor whose warnings were ignored and who has now died of the virus   have revived deep seated mistrust of China s official record keeping  The potential for unpleasant surprises hasn t passed yet ",2020-02-07,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-burberry-warns-of-major-sales-impact-from-virus-2078980,2078980
180409,401925,TPR,Sparkle fades as coronavirus risks wiping out luxury goods growth,news,"By Silvia Aloisi
MILAN  Reuters    The luxury goods industry normally relishes the spotlight  but in the case of China s coronavirus it is ruing being one of the most globally exposed sectors to an epidemic that risks all but wiping out its sales growth this year 
Brands from  Burberry   L BRBY  to  Estee Lauder   N EL  are shutting stores and cutting profit forecasts as business in the industry s biggest market has virtually ground to a halt 
 Shopping malls are closed  the few stores that are still open are working on reduced hours and above all there is no  customer  traffic   said Stefano Sassi  CEO of Italy s Valentino 
Burberry was the latest big brand to warn of a hit to demand on Friday  withdrawing its financial guidance for 2020 and saying it had closed more than a third of its stores in mainland China 
It said spending by Chinese tourists in Europe and elsewhere had not been hit as much  but given widening travel restrictions  it forecast this would worsen in the coming weeks 
With entire cities in the world s second biggest economy shut off  flights canceled and several countries  including the United States  banning entry to visitors who have been in China recently  the luxury industry is now facing a major sales hit 
Jefferies analyst Flavio Cereda cut his full year growth estimates for the sector to 1  from 5  at constant currencies 
 The shortfall is around 12 billion euros and the risks is to de facto  skip  a year   he said  forecasting a 35  decline in Chinese luxury spending in the first quarter 
DOUBLE WHAMMY
The epidemic has hit luxury brands while they are still reeling from a plunge in sales in the shopping hub of Hong Kong following months of often violent protest 
Some offset that thanks to growth in mainland China last year  but the coronavirus epidemic has put paid to that 
American Airlines  O AAL  and United Airlines  O UAL  among others have suspended flights from U S  hubs not just to mainland China but also to Hong Kong  one of the world s top five luxury destinations  due to low demand 
The outbreak also coincided with China s Lunar New Year holiday  which last year saw shoppers rack up about  150 billion in spending  including on travel and restaurants 
Chinese consumers account for more than a third of global spending on luxury goods  with most purchases made abroad  On average  Chinese buyers in Europe spend 790 euros   865  per purchase  but that can rise to 2 800 euros if they splurge on jewelry  according to tax free shopping specialist Planet 
They have fueled the sector s breakneck growth of the past decade and accounted for 90  of last year s increase in revenues to 281 billion euros  consultancy Bain   Company estimates 
 Because the Chinese represent a third of the luxury audience  any percentage point that you lose in sales ends up equating to quite a sizeable impact in terms of bottom line   David Perrotta  Planet s UK country manager  told Reuters 
This week  Estee Lauder  which makes Clinique skincare products   Coach  handbag maker Tapestry  N TPR  and Capri  the owner of Michael Kors  Versace and Jimmy Choo  all cut their profit forecasts for the year due to the virus outbreak 
Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  has shut about half of its 110 stores in China  while jewelry maker  Pandora   CO PNDORA  said business in the country was at a standstill 
Make up specialist L Oreal  PA OREP  said e commerce  which accounts for almost 50  of its sales in China  would help it weather the crisis  but still expected an impact on demand 
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH  PA LVMH   the world s biggest luxury group  has said that if the virus spread is contained by the end of March its impact wouldn t be too bad  Yet it reported a 40  drop in Hong Kong revenues in the fourth quarter and the health scare is likely to hit its duty free business 
The French conglomerate  which recently bought U S  jeweler Tiffany  is better placed to cope than others thanks to a strong U S  business  said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca  who also favors Moncler  MI MONC  and EssilorLuxottica  PA ESLX  
Firms like  Richemont   S CFR   Swatch  S UHR  and  Kering   PA PRTP  are more exposed  as they make between 45  and 59  of their revenues from Chinese nationals  according to Bernstein ",2020-02-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sparkle-fades-as-coronavirus-risks-wiping-out-luxury-goods-growth-2079075,2079075
180411,401927,TPR,Jobs Report Shows U S  Economy Still Solid as Virus Fears Spread,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    The U S  economy stayed in robust health in January  with no visible impact from the Chinese coronavirus outbreak  but the figures weren t enough to give any further momentum to markets that had already rallied sharply earlier in the week 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U S  economy created 225 000 jobs in January  well above initial forecasts for a rise of 160 000  However  the impact of the data was blunted by a strong reading for private sector payrolls from ADP earlier in the week 
With the headline number neutered  market attention focused on other elements of the report  which gave a more mixed picture 
Average weekly earnings  for example  rose only 0 2  on the month  below expectations for a 0 3  gain  but in annual terms they ticked up to 3 1   Analysts polled by Investing com had expected that rate to stay at 3 0  this month  
 Slowing wage growth for both supervisors and production workers  Certainly no inflation pressures for the Fed to worry about   said Julia Coronado  a professor of UT Austin and former Federal Reserve economist  via Twitter 
The jobless rate  meanwhile  ticked up slightly to 3 6  from 3 5    another apparent inconsistency with the strong rise in employment 
Liz Ann Sonders  chief investment officer at Charles Schwab  said the report was  strong   but noted declines in both manufacturing and retail jobs  These were offset by a big increase in jobs in the education and health sectors  along with construction jobs 
The S P 500 futures contract edged down in the hour following the report  as market participants found little convincing evidence to add to gains posted so far this week  Although the contract was down 0 4  from late Thursday by 9 25 AM ET  1425 GMT   it was still up more than 2 5  for the week   a remarkable performance given the ongoing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China 
On Thursday  both luxury goods maker Tapestry  NYSE TPR  and auto giant Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  NYSE FCAU  had warned of negative impacts on sales and production  respectively  Those warnings were echoed by British fashion group   Burberry    LON BRBY  early on Friday  which said footfall in its Chinese stores was down by 80  on the year  However  French cosmetics giant L Oreal  OTC LRLCY   another company with heavy exposure to China   said it expects only a temporary impact 
In other markets  the dollar index was likewise little changed after the numbers  on course for its highest weekly close since September after a 0 7  rise over the week  The greenback has also hit various highs against emerging market currencies this week as other central banks have cut interest rates  reinforcing the impression that the U S  is better insulated against the outbreak than many other countries 
The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury yield fell by three basis points to 1 59  on the report  its lowest in three days ",2020-02-07,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/jobs-report-shows-us-economy-still-solid-as-virus-fears-spread-2079270,2079270

180465,401981,TPR,Is Tapestry  TPR  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tapestry  Inc    NYSE TPR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tapestry has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 45  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 56  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Tapestry s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 99 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail   Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 29  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Tapestry has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 19  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tapestry stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Tapestry has a P S ratio of about 1 36  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 56x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tapestry currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Tapestry a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the PEG ratio for Tapestry is just 1 15  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 52  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  TPR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Tapestry might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F  This gives TPR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and one down in the same time period  This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tapestry  Inc  Price and Consensus
   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  
Bottom LineTapestry is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 30  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through Q3 2019  while the S P 500 gained  39 6   five of our strategies returned  51 8    57 5    96 9    119 0   and even  158 9  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   Q3 2019  while the S P averaged  5 6  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  54 1  per year ",2020-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-tapestry-tpr-a-suitable-stock-for-value-investors-200498976,200498976

180483,401999,TPR,Tapestry Tanks On Earnings As Market Cycles Suggest More Pain,opinion,"Summary
  Tapestry  NYSE TPR  tanked 22  on Thursday  after the company posted revenue that missed Wall Street expectations  

  Based on its market cycles  we believe TPR  which owns luxury brands such as Coach and Kate Spade  has further downside risk  
The company reported earnings per share of  0 61 and total revenue of  1 51 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  0 61 and  1 53 billion  With regard to guidance  management now expects a decline in both earnings and revenue in the coming quarter  

CEO Victor Luis explained that   Kate Spade did not meet our expectations and more time is required to drive a positive inflection  We acknowledge that there are opportunities to improve performance and we are addressing those areas with a sense of urgency  

Our approach to stock analysis uses market cycles to project price action  Our view is that TPR is still in the declining phase of its current cycle with more time to go  The stock has been in a long downtrend and patterns suggest declines into the fall  with no visible support until  12

180484,402000,TPR,A little help from  Mr Bags   Prada plays catch up online in China,news,By Pei Li and Giulia Segreti BEIJING MILAN  Reuters    At Prada s  HK 1913  Spring Summer 2018 show in Milan last week in a warehouse papered with giant pop art comic strips  one name in the coveted front row stood out  Tao Liang  otherwise known as Chinese blogger  Mr Bags   His presence alongside Vogue s Anna Wintour and Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni is a sign of Prada s efforts to turn around its business with a focus on the digital sphere   where it has lost ground to rivals including Kering s  PA PRTP  Gucci  And nowhere is a revival more critical than in China  which accounts for close to a third of all global luxury sales  Crucially  Chinese luxury buyers tend to be younger than elsewhere  and online influencers like  Mr Bags  carry real clout  Prada  whose profits and sales have been sliding  is playing catch up with rivals like Louis Vuitton  PA LVMH   Fendi and even the more affordable luxury brands like  Coach   N COH   All have raced ahead  forging tie ups with bloggers and online stars who draw in Asia s smartphone obsessed youth  While online influencers are a force globally  in China  bloggers like  Mr Bags    Gogoboi  or  FreshBoy  can have tens of millions of followers  and an outsized say on shopping trends   The key opinion leaders  KOLs  in China are very powerful  They can promote a product to an extent that no counterparts in Europe can match   said Chinese fashion blogger Yang Dong  who has called Prada the  depressed teenager  of luxury brands  Yang said Prada s issue in the market was not its design   When other brands roll out new products  they first come to China weeks in advance and get Internet celebrities and KOLs to lead the trend   he said   If Prada doesn t put its marketing focus on China  it will lose more ground   Prada  which appointed a new global digital director  Chiara Tosato  in March  is starting to catch on  Tosato said earlier this month the fashion house would look to drive online sales globally   a change from 2014  when CEO Patrizio Bertelli said it would focus on physical stores  Prada will this year complete the roll out of its e commerce platform in key markets including China  South Korea  Japan  Australia and Russia  It s already active in Europe and the United States  Prada declined to comment for this article  RISKS AND REWARDS To be sure  an online presence won t solve other issues like too many shops  and customers can feel some tie ups make the brand less aspirational  Online buyers can also be more fickle  Yet Prada s modest online sales target  including sales through e tailer partners  is for 5 percent of its total by end 2018  For smaller  luxury outerwear maker Moncler  MI MONC   it s 6 percent this year   meaning it s already reaping the data dividends that come with online sales  The power of China s online stars means they are impossible to ignore in a country where hundreds of millions of people use microblogs such as Weibo  O WB   Top fashion blogger  Gogoboi  has more than 7 million followers there   Mr Bags  has a more modest 3 million  but is seen as a leading influencer when it comes to accessories   When a new bag comes out  probably it doesn t get much attention  But when a fashion blogger or celebrity carries it  it s suddenly out of stock   said Yang Lei  a Chinese online shopping agent selling luxury goods back to China  And Prada needs that support  Even as its China sales recovered slightly in the first half of this year  to 302 million euros   359 million   Prada s global profits fell 18 percent  after a 2016 bottom line that was its lowest since its 2011 initial public offering  Gucci  meanwhile  has seen its sales jump  Of course  slow to digital was not Prada s only issue  It also opened more stores than its mega brand rivals and failed to spot the power of high margin casualwear  A Reuters analysis of Weibo shows Prada far behind Coach  Gucci and Louis Vuitton in terms of celebrity tie ups and endorsements online  The brand has 309 000 followers on the popular platform   around a tenth of what Coach can boast  Unlike some rivals  Prada has steered clear of creating limited edition capsule collections in collaboration with influencers  In contrast  a young  fringe Chinese rap group told Reuters they were in talks with Coach over a tie up   a sign that even potential future stars are being tapped   The power of digital is a critical part of our global transformation plan     we are always seeking innovative ways to leverage social platforms   a Coach spokesperson told Reuters  adding that partnering with Chinese actress Tiffany Tang and singer Timmy Xu  is one way we are working with KOLs to build emotional bonds with our consumers   Prada is finally following  albeit cautiously   Prada works with influencers in different regions including Asia  but will push into this more and increase collaborations   a person familiar with its plans told Reuters  noting Prada is  not obsessed  with collaboration and doesn t want to dilute its brand  Alongside  Mr Bags  in Milan last week  Prada also hosted Filipino fashion blogger  BryanBoy   Hong Kong actress Tina Leung  South Korean model Irene Kim and Singaporean designer Yoyo Cao  Prada has also done pop up stores focused on Asia  aiming at millennial shoppers  That push could help reach consumers like Xu Dan  a 28 year old business development worker in Beijing  who says she reads all  Mr Bags  posts   I trust these bloggers  sensitivity to fashion   Not everyone will be easy to move  Akane Kishi  a 29 year old human resources worker shopping in Tokyo  said Prada had just not kept up   I often see Fendi on Instagram and think I want to buy that one  in that color   she said ,2017-09-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/a-little-help-from-mr-bags-prada-plays-catchup-online-in-china-534104,534104

180502,402018,TPR,Kors needs to buckle down for Jimmy Choo deal to shine,news,By Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale  Reuters    U S  retailer Michael Kors  N KORS  is betting that its acquisition of storied shoemaker Jimmy Choo will give sales a much needed boost  but lingering problems at Kors  core bag business could delay potential benefits   Kors said earlier this week it would buy Jimmy Choo for  1 2 billion and plans to expand the line by opening more stores  especially in Asia  Jimmy Choo  whose towering stilettos were made famous by characters in the popular TV series  Sex and the City   is synonymous with affluence  and somewhat at odds with Kors  image of accessible luxury  It could be argued that Jimmy Choo will give Kors s tumbling sales and stock a leg up  but experts said Kors  expansion plans could dilute the shoemaker s brandname   Revenue expansion doesn t come from opening stores today  but figuring out how to unlock the e commerce component and  Kors  haven t proven that they get that either   said Eric Schiffer  CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization  Kors has made this mistake before  Once a seller of popular Mercer and Hamilton handbags  Kors put its wares too quickly on too many shelves  making them ubiquitous  Since then  the company has struggled to come up with designs that have caught the fancy of the well heeled buyer  who have gravitated toward bags offered by  Coach  Inc  N COH  and Tory Burch  Kors  has been trying to stem the sales declines by expanding into dresses  menswear and online  but has had little success    If  Kors  had fixed their U S  market  if they d shown improvements there and then made this acquisition  people would be a lot more comfortable with it   said Gabriella Santaniello  analyst at A Line partners   For  Jimmy Choo   I could see them opening in another market but I think that is what makes everyone nervous  It is like   Look what they did with the Michael Kors brand  are they going to do that to Jimmy Choo   MULTIBRAND STRATEGY Kors  rival Coach Inc  N COH  faced similar problems not so long ago  But Coach responded quickly  by tightening supplies to department stores to regain its luxury cachet  before diversifying with the buyout of upscale shoemaker Stuart Weitzman in 2015  The company recently bought smaller rival Kate Spade  whose products are a hit with millennials  Both retailers seem to be looking to emulate the successful multibrand strategy employed by European companies LVMH  PA LVMH  and  Kering  SA  PA PRTP   where cash flows from one large brand are reinvested into smaller but faster growing ones  These two companies have grown into luxury powerhouses by buying multiple luxury brands such as Christian Dior  Tag Heuer  Gucci  and Alexander McQueen  Kors  CEO John Idol said the company would look to grow by buying more globally recognized luxury brands like Jimmy Choo       we are really looking to build an international luxury company and less so brands that     have a greater reliance on wholesale than its own retail strategy   he said on a conference call on Tuesday  Idol said Jimmy Choo would be run independently with minimal interference from Kors  management and that he doesn t want the two brands to be linked with each other  But analysts said while this could be the right approach for Coach  which has a creative  forward thinking team  it could overwhelm Kors  at least initially  Kors will need to have a deep understanding of demand  it will have to innovate to drive excitement  maintain the trueness of the brands it acquires  and little or no overlap with other brands in its portfolio  said Jason Green  CEO of customer strategy firm Cambridge Group  For now at least  analysts said  Kors should be looking to walk before it runs ,2017-07-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kors-needs-to-buckle-down-for-jimmy-choo-deal-to-shine-511782,511782

180514,402030,TPR,Tapestry  TPR  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Tapestry   NYSE TPR    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3 8  over the past month  TPR hit a new 52 week high of  54 83 in the previous session  Tapestry has gained 23 5  since the start of the year compared to the 4 4  move for the Retail Wholesale sector and the  4  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 6  2018  Tapestry reported EPS of  1 07 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 86 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 99  
For the current fiscal year  Tapestry is expected to post earnings of  2 59 per share on  5 86 billion in revenues  This represents a 20 47  change in EPS on a 30 51  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 88 per share on  6 08 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 2  and 3 8   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Tapestry may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for TPR  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Tapestry has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18 7X versus its peer group s average of 8 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 87  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Tapestry  Inc  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Tapestry currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Tapestry passes the test  Thus  it seems as though TPR shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2018-04-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tapestry-tpr-hits-a-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200310214,200310214

27 and at the same time released news of a solid beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   The company topped forecasts by 33  but most of the attention was paid to the  1 2B deal The Zacks Rank is focused on the movement of earnings estimates   The Zacks Consensus Estimate only has a number for FY2018  and that estimate has been moving up  Roughly 90 days ago the number stood at  1 12 but following the big earnings beat  the number moved higher to  1 36 DescriptionH E Equipment Services  Inc  is one of the largest integrated equipment services companies in the United States with full

selling opportunities among its new   used equipment sales  rental  parts sales   service operations Earnings BeatsOver the last four reports  there were two beats and two misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The most recent beat was the huge 33  positive earnings surprise posted in July   That followed a negative earnings surprise of 6   The quarter prior to that saw a beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 05 and that translated into a positive earnings surprise of 16    If you are any good at math you see that I have present three of the four recent reports with two beats and one only miss  That means the last report was also a miss ValuationI see a forward earnings multiple of only 20x and that is slightly below the 21x trailing multiple   The price to book multiple of 6x will keep most of the value minded investors out of the stock  The price to sales multiple of about 1x is pretty low  so management might want to focus on where they can find some more revenue growth  outside of the pending acquisition   Brookdale Senior Living NYSE      recently saw its Zacks Rank slip to the lowest level it can go  The stock is now a Zack Rank  5  Strong Sell  and today

the United States  The Company is committed to providing an exceptional living experience through properties that are designed  purpose built and operated to provide the highest quality service  care and living accommodations for residents  The Company owns and operates independent  assisted and dementia care facilities Earnings HistoryOne of the factors that determine the Zacks Rank is the earnings history   It isn t the biggest factor  but it is in the mix   The earnings history for BKD is not good  with the company missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports EstimatesThe biggest factor that determines the Zacks Rank is the move in earnings estimates   The analysts that cover the stock have been lowering their estimates as reflected in the move of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   Analysts were looking for a gain of  0 59 for 2017 just 90 days ago  but that has changed and it has done so in a big way   The current consensus estimate is calling for a loss of  1 33   That is a huge reversal for this year The 2018 number also saw a huge reversal  It moved from a gain of  0 66 90 days ago to the current level of a loss of  0 51 ValuationWith the earnings estimates now a negative number the forward PE is not a number we can use   The price to book has dropped down to 1 1x and that should interest the value investors that are reading this  Price to sales is only at 0 4x  but that often happens when a stock sees a significant drop in price Additional content Jimmy Choo Posts Insane Profit Growth  What It Means for Michael Kors On Thursday  stiletto icon Jimmy Choo  which trades on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker  CHOO   reported a huge year over year rise in pretax profit for the first half of 2017 Before tax  Jimmy Choo said that profits came in at  18 1 million in the six months to June 30  jumping 174  from the prior year period and surpassing the total profit the company reported for the whole of 2016  However  last year s figures were affected by foreign exchange losses and higher financing expenses  notes  Taking into account interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization  adjusted earnings grew 19 5  year over year The luxury shoemaker s revenues surged 16 5  to  201 6 million thanks to foreign exchange movements  on a constant currency basis  sales rose 4 5   Jimmy Choo said its sales have continued to grow ahead of the market  despite a challenging operating environment Retail and wholesale revenue increased 19  and 10   respectively  while licensing was another standout segment  Jimmy Choo s licensing business includes its fragrance and sunglasses lines  and it grew 40  to  8 7 million  Our long term growth strategy is to nurture the brand s unique DNA  to strive for excellence in business execution and to enhance client experience  in order to deliver superior growth and profitability  as well as leveraging the significant investments we have made in the business to date  We have continued to make good progress through the first half and are well positioned to deliver over the remainder of the year   said Pierre Denis  CEO of Jimmy Choo Despite these strong numbers  Jimmy Choo still remain cautious in regards to the overall retail and economic environment  But  the company s chairman  Peter Harf  said it is confident and excited about Jimmy Choo s upcoming sale to Michael Kors  NYSE       Earlier this summer  the  affordable  luxury retailer announced that it  agreed to buy the shoemaker for  896 million  or about  1 2 billion  The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year It ll be interesting to see how Michael Kors utilizes the Jimmy Choo brand  While the purchase had been a long rumored one  their customer bases do not go hand in hand  Michael Kors has completely saturated the handbag market the company is the top handbag maker in the U S  with the MK logo seemingly appearing everywhere when you walk down the street  On the other hand  Jimmy Choo is the epitome of luxe  Like its peers Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin  a Jimmy Choo stiletto can easily sell for over  1 000 Kors is likely hoping to use its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo s footprint  Similar to what Coach  NYSE       did when the company acquired Stuart Weitzman Coach also bought fellow handbag maker Kate Spade this year the company will probably open Jimmy Choo retail stores and further develop the brand s online presence  And with the shoemaker s surge in profits  it looks like Kors made a smart choice in scooping up the iconic footwear brand Looking ahead  Jimmy Choo hopes to implement new logistics improvements to  facilitate improves sell through if collections  during the second half of 2017 Jimmy Choo closed

Retail and wholesale revenue increased 19  and 10   respectively  while licensing was another standout segment  Jimmy Choo s licensing business includes its fragrance and sunglasses lines  and it grew 40  to  8 7 million 
 Our long term growth strategy is to nurture the brand s unique DNA  to strive for excellence in business execution and to enhance client experience  in order to deliver superior growth and profitability  as well as leveraging the significant investments we have made in the business to date  We have continued to make good progress through the first half and are well positioned to deliver over the remainder of the year   said Pierre Denis  CEO of Jimmy Choo

180558,402074,TPR,Michael Kors Buys Jimmy Choo  What s Next For The Luxury Brands,opinion,"On Tuesday   affordable  luxury retailer Michael Kors   NYSE KORS   announced that it has agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo  a popular brand name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos  for about  1 2 billion  or  896 million  in cash  Kors will pay  2 30 per share for the luxury shoemaker 
Shares of Jimmy Choo  which trade on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker  CHOO   rallied after the news broke  surging over 17   Michael Kors stock  however  is currently trading down about 0 4  in mid morning trading 
 We believe that Jimmy Choo is poised for meaningful growth in the future and our company is committed to supporting the strong brand equity that Jimmy Choo has built over the last 20 years   John Idol  CEO of Michael Kors  said in a statement 
Jimmy Choo initially announced that it wanted a new buyer in April  Its largest shareholder  JAB Holding  acquired the brand back in 2011 for  540 million  or  800 million at the time  and then took the company public in 2014  But JAB is a privately held business group  and has built its brand portfolio around coffee and food companies rather than luxury accessories  it owns American coffee giants like Peet s Coffee   Tea  Caribou Coffee  and Keurig Green Mountain  and recently purchased Panera Bread  NASDAQ PNRA  Co 
Michael Kors said the deal has the support of JAB  and comes just a few months after Coach s   NYSE COH    of Kate Spade   Coach  an iconic American handbag and leather goods maker  is on a dedicated quest to transform its brand  cutting back on promotional discounts and pulling its products out of department stores  they hope Kate Spade will help them achieve this 
It ll be interesting to see how Michael Kors utilizes the Jimmy Choo brand  however  While the purchase had been a long rumored one  their customer bases do not go hand in hand  Michael Kors has completely saturated the handbag market the company is the top handbag maker in the U S  with the MK logo seemingly appearing everywhere when you walk down the street  On the other hand  Jimmy Choo is the epitome of luxe  Like its peers Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin  a Jimmy Choo stiletto can easily sell for over  1 000 
Kors  though  is hoping to use its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo s footprint  Similar to what Coach did when the company acquired Stuart Weitzman  the company plans to  support the growth of Jimmy Choo through retail store openings and further development of its online presence as well as through an expanded assortment of additional fashion product offerings   Jimmy Choo s existing management team will stay in place as well  like renowned designer Sandra Choi  Michael Kors added 
Founded in 1996 by designer Jimmy Choo and former Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon  Jimmy Choo is a luxury staple in the fashion industry  Its high price point didn t stop the brand s soaring popularity over the years  even appearing in movies and TV shows like The Devil Wears Prada and Sex and the City  In fact  sales have been booming these past few years  and the new deal could be an opportunity to double Jimmy Choo s yearly sales to  1 billion 
While the world will surely be getting a lot more Jimmy Choos  Michael Kors should be cautious in this new venture  making sure it does not cheapen the luxury legacy brand

180566,402082,TPR,Dior struggles to find the right fit in its search for a designer,news,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS  Reuters     Christian Dior   PA DIOR   one of the world s biggest and most famous fashion brands  is struggling to find a creative director more than six months after the abrupt departure of Raf Simons   People familiar with the discussions say part of the reason his seat is still vacant is the limited control offered by the 70 year old label compared with similar roles at rivals such as Yves Saint Laurent  Gucci and  Coach    Often when a creative director leaves  it is because he did not get enough control   said one fashion communications guru who has worked for big brands including Givenchy  and who declined to be named   Simons is expected to get much more leeway at Calvin Klein  part of PVH Corp  N PVH   where he should start working in a few months  fashion industry sources have said   Adding to its woes  Dior s sales growth has stalled in recent months  reflecting a fall in tourism to Europe after the Paris and Brussels attacks and weaker demand in some key Asian markets  Main shareholder Bernard Arnault  France s richest man  wants a proven quantity to steer the label famous for its cinch waisted Bar jacket  head hunters and fashion executives say  but the talent pool of potential replacements is small   A further problem is that most designers are prevented by their contracts from working for a rival for up to a year   Candidates who have been seriously considered include Alber Elbaz  credited with resuscitating the Lanvin brand but sacked in October after trying to bring in external investors   But Elbaz was put off in part by the limited scope of the Dior job  having been in charge of everything from collections to advertising at Lanvin  sources close to the designer said   There was also Hedi Slimane  who was creative director at Yves Saint Laurent until last month  Slimane s track record of seeking to gradually increase his control over every facet of a brand  as he did at YSL  meant Dior could not strike a deal with him either  fashion sources said  To replace Simons  several people pointed to Maria Grazia Chiuri who currently designs alongside Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino  one of the luxury industry s fastest growing brands  A move would make her the first woman to design womenswear for Dior but complicate Valentino s plans to float in 2017   One source close to Dior confirmed Chiuri was a potential candidate but stressed her name was on a list that also included internal applicants  The source said the hiring process was likely to take some time  possibly a few more weeks   Valentino and Dior declined to comment   SUBTLE MIX There is no set formula when hiring a new creative director  fashion executives and head hunters say  The requirements and expectations vary greatly depending on the brand s size  history and whether it is looking for continuity or a creative reboot  Dior s desire for someone charismatic and current  with a strong vision but who will be happy to be confined to a relatively narrow role  could be a tall order  several fashion industry sources said  speaking on condition of anonymity   The Dior job entails designing collections and some accessories  producing six fashion shows a year  giving interviews and representing the brand at events  It does not extend into revamping boutiques  many of which are designed by Peter Marino  major changes to the Lady Dior handbag or meddling with Dior s advertising for perfume and beauty products  which generate the bulk of its 5 billion euros   5 67 billion  in annual sales   Quitting Dior  Simons said he wanted to focus on his own label and his personal life  but some in the industry say his intellectual and minimalist style did not sit comfortably with the brand s flamboyant image  In one famous ad campaign  a gold lame clad Charlize Theron struts through Versailles Palace to promote J adore perfume  one of the world s best sellers    The problem is that when you are a brand the size of Dior  you have its heritage on the one hand  the designer s world on the other  and then you also have all these many different types of women you want to seduce with the help of celebrity adverts   said a fashion manager at one of the industry s biggest groups   SOLOIST VS ORCHESTRA DIRECTOR In the past decade  the role of artistic director has evolved from sketching dresses to creating a brand universe that extends into marketing strategies and the shopping experience   Justin O Shea was appointed in March as creative director of Italian tailor Brioni and given clear responsibility for the Kering owned brand s image    Before  the designer was a soloist  today he is an orchestra director who tells other people what to draw and what to do   said Ralph Toledano  head of fashion brands Nina Ricci and Jean Paul Gaultier and chairman of the French Federation of couture  ready to wear designers and fashion designers  Slimane at YSL was the industry s reference in terms of control  he was involved in everything  from ad campaigns he shot himself to the atmosphere of its boutiques to the design and content of the website  YSL is Kering s fastest growing brand  with annual revenues of nearly 1 billion euros  roughly half the size of Dior Couture   Stuart Vevers  creative director of U S  brand

sure many creative directors still do   Vevers told Reuters on the fringes of the Conde Nast International luxury conference in Seoul   Coach s sales and profits rose last quarter   Some designers

180568,402084,TPR,Shoppers  paradise lost  Singapore s malls suffer as locals  tourists curb spending,news,"By Manesha Pereira and Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE  Reuters    After serving only a handful of customers in five hours on a recent weekday  Sam Goh said he was worried the sportswear shop he manages  LIV ACTIV  will eventually join other brands in leaving Singapore s Orchard Road shopping boulevard 
Singapore s reputation as a shoppers  paradise  which saw investors pour S 10 billion   7 25 billion  into retail developments here in the past five years  is taking a pummeling because of weakness in the local economy and a drop in spending by tourists  Commercial space has increased by a tenth in that period  but vacancy rates have risen to 7 3 percent from 5 0 percent and industry analysts expect them to keep rising 
 Instantly when you enter this mall you see emptiness   said the 44 year old Goh  whose shop gave up a quarter of its space last month to cut costs 
Further down the street  cashiers play games on their phones  while some shop assistants have improvised a mini golf game along a quiet corridor of a shopping center  Thirteen of 16 units on the 5th floor lack tenants 
Store space in places with lower foot traffic is getting few takers  For example  in a suburban area on the west side of Singapore  more than two thirds of a basement shopping center that has been open for almost two years remains empty 
These are all signs of bets that have gone wrong  that the domestic economy would remain robust  allowing demand from this city state of 5 5 million people to stay strong  and that retail splurges by visitors from the rising middle classes in China  India and Southeast Asia would keep increasing 
For Singapore this is not a small thing   wholesale and retail trade vies with manufacturing to be the biggest contributor to the city state s gross domestic product and it is the biggest employer here 
But the sluggish global economy has put a brake on spending by Singaporeans  especially workers in hard hit export sectors  Shoppers from abroad  meanwhile  spent 7 percent less in the first nine months of 2015 than they did in the same period of 2014 
LANDLORDS HIT
Wealthy Chinese  hit by an economic slowdown and a corruption crackdown at home  have less appetite for the luxury items they flocked to Singapore to buy during the boom years 
China also has built many of its own luxury malls and has even set up duty free paradises in local tourist hot spots to lift consumption and spur domestic tourism 
And Indonesians  Thais and Malaysians now have cheaper versions of the same products back home  A luxury bag made by  Coach   N COH  can now cost twice as much in Singapore as in these countries 
In Bangkok and Jakarta  retail space has risen 20 25 percent in five years  with vacant space shrinking  data from real estate firm CBRE shows 
 Many rich Chinese used to come and spend money on luxury items and that is no longer the case and in the region you have a lot of competition   said Christine Li  director of research at commercial real estate services company Cushman   Wakefield 
 I am pessimistic about retail here   she said in reference to Singapore 
The deteriorating retail outlook is among several challenges faced by Singapore s property sector  which includes developers and real estate investment trusts or landlords  with shares of companies such as Frasers Centrepoint  SI FRCT    Capitaland   SI CATL  and Wheelock Properties  SI WPSL  losing 10 20 percent in the past 12 months 
More than 2 million square feet of new retail space will be ready for occupation in Singapore by the end of 2017  and it won t be easy to find tenants  But many of the bigger developers are partially protected from the downturn because they are present across segments like hospitality or homes in other Asian markets and beyond 
 Over the next three years you can see that supply is fairly strong and although the first quarter was fairly resilient  you re not seeing much revenue growth   said Joshua Tan  an analyst with Maybank Kim Eng  referring to real estate investment trusts  He said that many of the retailers suffered from having similar product offerings to their rivals 
Sales of apparel and footwear in Singapore dropped 3 5 percent year on year in March and 14 6 percent in February  with brands such as British apparel brand New Look and Celio of France planning to close branches in Singapore this year 
Seth Kok from SG Debt Busters  has seen a 23 percent increase so far this year in shopowner clients seeking advice on how to reduce debt or deal with bankruptcy 
Retailers  expanded way too fast   said Kok   But things turned bad     everything started when China slowed down  
THE GREAT DISCOUNT
Internal factors are at play as well  Measures to give Singaporeans priority for jobs have curbed the number of expatriates on juicy salaries  Wage growth is expected to slow to 2 5 3 0 percent in 2016  compared with a 10 year average of 3 6 percent 
 We cannot fight these major trends   said Stephen Goh  executive director at Orchard Road Business Association  mentioning the job curbs  a strong currency  weaker tourism spending and a tendency for more Singaporeans to shop in cheaper malls overseas 
Many hopes are pinned on  The Great Singapore Sale   an annual marketing event  which started on Friday and will last 10 weeks this year  But discount signs have been ubiquitous across the island for some time 
Robinsons department stores have been offering up to 70 percent off a variety of goods for the past two weeks 
Rising interest rates prompted by the U S  Federal Reserve s hike in rates in December have also restrained domestic spending  Mortgage consultants say the monthly cost of repayments on a mid range condominium apartment goes up by S 400 for every 1 percentage point rise in Sibor 
 My family and I used to shop     almost every week   said 50 year old store manager Dino Ahmari  who pays a mortgage   Now we make it a point to spend only once every two months

180574,402090,TPR,Kate Spade Stock Upon Coach Acquisition,opinion,"Ever since Coach Inc  NYSE COH  announced it would be acquiring rival Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE  on May 8th  2017  the Kate Spade stock has been forming the weirdest set of consolidating Spinning Top candlesticks ever  The stock has been trading in a really narrow range around the 18 42 level  However  it slowly but surely has been moving higher  Let us understand the Coach Kate Spade better with a Kate Spade stock analysis 
1  Fundamental Points 
Who are they Many of our lady investors may already be obsessed with Kate Spade New York products  The brand offers a variety of products  from handbags and clothing to jewelry  fashion accessories  fragrance  eyewear  shoes  swimwear  home decor  desk accessories  stationery  tabletop and gifts 
It all started back in 1993  when Katee Brosnahan Spade  a former accessories editor at Mademoiselle  set out to design handbags  Debuting with six silhouettes  she combined sleek  utilitarian shapes and colorful palettes in an entirely new way  And so  was born in the Big Apple 
Who are their competitors Kate Spade is considered as an  affordable luxury  brand  Its most direct competitors are Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS   and Coach  both based in New York as well  Tory Burch is also considered a competitor  however  it is a private company yet to go public 
Coach vs  Kate Spade stock analysis   One of the most important factors to consider is Kate Spade s very low store count in North America of 108 full price units and 68 outlet stores versus Coach s 223 full price units and 172 outlets  Coach s market cap is almost 6 times larger than Kate Spade  standing at 13 087B  It also pays dividends of approximately 2 92   or  1 35 per share  while Kate Spade stopped paying dividends when it dropped to its IPO price back in 2009 
Michael Kors  While Michael Kors was quick in growing its market share until 2016  expanding from about 350 company operated retail stores at the end of March 2013 to 670 stores at the end of March 2016  its brand value has dropped among fashionistas  In 2017  it is closing up to 125 stores  Sales at stores open at least a year  comparable sales  fell 14 1  in its most recent quarter  and continue to fall sharply this year  What s more  Michael Kors  wholesale business fell 22 8  in the quarter 
Good to know  Stocks of mid price fashion firms have fallen out of favor with investors and fashionista alike in the recent years 
What s the Latest on the Acquisition Coach Inc  NYSE COH   was able to reach a deal to acquire Kate Spade   Co  in May 2017  Under the terms of the transaction  Kate Spade shareholders will receive  18 50 per share in cash for a total transaction value of  2 4 billion  This tender offer will expire on June 23  unless extended 
Coach stock price jumped 5 per cent after the acquisition announcement  and after the company released its fiscal third quarter results that included better than expected earnings 
With the acquisition  Coach has some opportunity to add Kate Spade stores  especially in areas where Coach has already closed some of its full price stores 
We can perhaps learn best about Kate Spade from Coach CEO Victor Luis  who said in May  Kate Spade has a truly unique and differentiated brand positioning with a broad lifestyle assortment and strong awareness among consumers  especially millennials  
On the other hand  after the deal was reached on May 8th  Kate Spade chief executive officer Craig A  Leavitt wrote in a press released that joining  Coach s portfolio of global brands will maximize value for our shareholders and positions Kate Spade for long term success as we continue our evolution into a powerful  global  multi channel lifestyle brand  
Regardless of these warm notes  in the process of sealing a tender offer  another investor like Jimmy Choo  could potentially get involved in a hostile takeover  upping the offering price per share 
However  if the deal ends up going through  Coach and Kate Spade s leadership teams could join to leverage their expertise across the business  eliminating a competitor undercutting prices  and giving Coach the opportunity to help Kate Spade avoid the same pitfalls they face  The deal could ultimately end up being good for the industry as a whole 
This brings us to the second point of IDDA for the Whole Foods stock analysis  Technicals 
2  Technical PointsMonthly Chart  Looking at the monthly chart  Kate Spade stock price has had a choppy road since the company went public back in 1984  After reaching a high of  46 66 pre share in 2007 right before the financial crisis hit the globe  the stock price dropped like a rock to its IPO price of 1 56 
Kate Spade stock analysis   Monthly Chart Technicals   Fibonacci Ichimoku
After that  the stock was able to correct the losses over the following 6 years  almost reaching the previous highs  However  since 2014  it has been forming continuous lower highs  currently trading below the monthly Ichimoku cloud 
The 61  Fibonacci level of 15 89 is acting as a strong support 
Daily Chart  The stock price opened with an 8 percent gap jump on the Monday following the Coach acquisition announcement  However  since then it has been trading in a surprisingly narrow range  forming a series of Spinning Top candlesticks as it enters the daily Ichimoku cloud  The upper band of the cloud falls on the 50  Fibonacci level  marking a pivot level at 20 26  With that  any positive surprise on June 23rd could push the price to this level The Tenkan line has recently crossed above the Kijun line 
Kate Spade stock analysis   Daily Chart Technicals   Support   Pivot   Resistance
A break above the 20 26 pivot could give us the second Ichimoku confirmation  opening doors for a potential long term price hike to resistance levels at 22 48 and 24 37 respectively 3  Market Sentiment
Short term time frame Kate Spade stock analysis shows a pretty indecisive trading crowd  calling a spade a spade  Meanwhile  the stock s   which is a measure of the volatility  or systematic risk  is slightly above the market  at 1 29  Its one year target estimate according to Yahoo   NASDAQ AABA  Finance is approximately  20 per share  which is lower than our 22 48 technical resistance

That said  a very big picture view of COH shows that Tuesday s up spike has propelled the price structure toward completion of a massive 3 year accumulation base formation that will trigger much higher potential if the price structure climbs and sustains above 43 70 90 
If that signal emerges  Coach will face serious technical challenges trying to get to the  promised land  target zones of 54 55  and then to 60 61 
Overcoming Resistance
There is heavy resistance along the way  which can only be overcome if 1   the economy begins to accelerate beyond 1  growth and 2   the retail environment improves and 3   anticipated forthcoming quarterly earnings momentum resumes an upward trajectory

180588,402104,TPR,After Months Of Rumors  Coach Is Buying Kate Spade For  2 4 Billion,opinion,"On Monday  luxury retailer Coach Inc    NYSE COH    that it is buying handbag rival Kate Spade   NYSE KATE   in a deal worth  2 4 billion  Coach has been trying to remake its brand  cutting back on promotional discounts and pulling its products out of department stores  and scooping up Kate should help them during this transformation 
Under the terms of the deal  Coach will pay  18 50 per share for Kate Spade  representing a 27 5  premium to the closing price of shares of KATE on December 27  2016  Both company boards have approved the transaction  The  2 4 billion deal will be funded by a combination of senior notes  bank term notes  and  1 2 billion in cash 
 Kate Spade has a truly unique and differentiated brand positioning with a broad lifestyle assortment and strong awareness among consumers  especially millennials   said Victor Luis  CEO of Coach   Through this acquisition  we will create the first New York based house of modern luxury lifestyle brands  defined by authentic  distinctive products and fashion innovation  
 Following a thorough review of strategic alternatives  reaching an agreement to join Coach s portfolio of global brands will maximize value for our shareholders and positions Kate Spade for long term success as we continue our evolution into a powerful  global  multi channel lifestyle brand   said Craig A  Leavitt  CEO of Kate Spade 
Year to date  shares of Coach have gained almost 22  in value  After being dethroned by Michael Kors   NYSE KORS   as the top U S  handbag maker  the iconic American retailer is making a name for itself again in the luxury market  The company decided to exit from department stores like Macy s   NYSE M   and cut back on big sales events that had ultimately cheapened the Coach brand  just last week  Coach reported a profit beat and its fourth straight quarter of rising comparable sales in its North American market 
Coach hopes to employ the same business strategies at Kate Spade  a luxury company that has struggled lately  While the company saw a decent boost last year  raking in revenues of  1 38 billion  shares of Kate Spade have lost about 9 1  year to date  and the company even came under pressure from activist hedge fund Caerus Investors last fall since its profit margins were well below its rivals 
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of calendar 2017  Coach s financial advisor was Evercore Group and its legal advisor is Fried  Frank  Harris  Shriver   Jacobson  Kate Spade s financial advisor was Perella Weinberg and its legal advisor is Paul  Weiss  Rifkind  Wharton   Garrison

180592,402108,TPR,The Richest Of The Rich Are So Much Richer Than We Thought,news,"By    The world s richest 1 percent owns more wealth than economists have thought  depriving countries of billions of dollars in tax revenue and muting a shift in global inequality 
New research by European Central Bank economist Philip Vermeulen and London School of Economics economist Gabriel Zucman  conducted separately  shows the ultra wealthy s money  often hidden in tax shelters  is undercounted  World Bank research shows that correcting income data nearly erases the progress made from 1988 to 2008 in narrowing the gap between the world s rich and poor 
Economists estimate wealth with various government surveys of households  but the surveys often have small sample sizes  and the rich respond less to surveys than the poor  hiding the wealth of the non responding households  Vermuelen wrote in a July paper  He readjusted data  supplemented it with  rich lists  like the Forbes World s Billionaires list  and found that the 1 percent held 35 to 37 percent of global wealth in 2010  The U S  Federal Reserve s Survey of Consumer Finances reported the portion at 34 percent 
The heavy concentration of wealth at the top of economies could explain the slow recovery from recession in consumer spending  Joseph Stiglitz  the Nobel prize winning economist and author of The Price of Inequality  told Bloomberg 
The amount Americans spent on discretionary services like travel agencies and dining out nosedived during the recession in 2009  and though it s picked up  remains well below a pre recession peak and is growing slower relative to other periods of economic growth  The slow growth in consumer spending that s occurring seems to be coming more from upper income earners than middle  and lower income earners 
From 2009 to 2012  income for the top 1 percent of earners grew by 31 4 percent  while everyone else s incomes rose an average 0 4 percent  according to an analysis by UC Berkeley s Emmanuel Saez and the Paris School of Economics  Thomas Piketty 
Over the past 18 months  Bloomberg s Mass Merchant Index  which measures profit of businesses like Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT and Dollar General NYSE DG  rose 80 percent  while the Standard   Poor s index of the top 500 companies rose 109 percent over the same period  Meanwhile  luxury retailers like Coach Inc  NYSE COH and Prada S p A   HKG  1913  have gained 254 percent  according to Bloomberg s Global Luxury Goods Index 
That could help explain why middle  and lower income Americans are reporting less confidence in the economy than upper income Americans 

Accurate measurements of the world s wealth would help economists and governments craft tax policies to reduce fraud and illegal tax evasion 
Globally  8 percent of the world s personal financial wealth is held offshore  costing more than  200 billion to governments annually  and despite policy initiatives  corporate and personal profit shifting to tax havens and offshore wealth are rising  Zucman wrote  She argues for an international financial registry that would make avoiding taxes by taking advantage of overseas banking rules more difficult ",2014-08-07,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/the-richest-of-the-rich-are-so-much-richer-than-we-thought-301935,301935

180611,402127,TPR,RPT FEATURE Unemployment a social time bomb for Spain,news,"By Sonya Dowsett
 MADRID  Jan 1  Reuters    Tensions mounting between native
job seekers and immigrants competing for a declining pool of
work in Spain will intensify in 2009 as generous benefits for
those laid off reach the end of their fixed terms 
 Unemployment at 12 8 percent in November  a 12 year high and
by far the highest rate in the European Union  could reach 20
percent of the workforce in 2010 as a slump in construction
spreads into the wider economy  economists say 
 That is a level not seen since the 1990s and as Spain heads
for its deepest recession in 50 years it may trigger social
unrest like that of the 1980s  when high unemployment and low
wages led to country wide demonstrations and violent strikes 
 Spain makes payouts of up to 70 percent of salaries for up
to two years  depending on how long workers have been paying
into the social security system 
 With nearly 3 million unemployed  many of those laid off
during 2008 will come to the end of dole payouts next year and
will struggle to make ends meet in a depressed labour market
with no sign of paid work 
  This coming year  a lot of people will stop receiving the
dole   said Sandalio Gomez  professor of labour relations at
business school IESE   We could end up with social unrest as
people take to the streets to demonstrate  
 The make up of Spain s workforce has changed drastically
with the arrival of nearly 5 million immigrants boosting the
population by 15 percent over the past decade 
 Desperate Spaniards who have lost jobs in construction are
taking up work they formerly shunned  from cleaning bars to
fruit picking  displacing immigrants who struggle to find
alternative work 
 Thousands of Andalusians applied to pick olives for this
year s harvest from December to January  according to an 
Andalusian job agency  leaving the previous workforce of African
immigrants without employment 
 Despite offers from local authorities to pay their coach
fares back to Africa  immigrants are sleeping rough or in
homeless shelters in a situation described by one charity as a
genuine social problem  Another flashpoint in the southern
region could be February s strawberry harvest in Huelva  on the
border with Portugal  where migrants traditionally find work 
 Felix Veliz  a Madrid based former construction sector
worker from Ecuador who worked for Corman  which installed
safety equipment in building sites  says many of his colleagues
were forced to sleep rough when the company filed for
administration in September 
 The 49 year old who came to Spain nearly 10 years ago cannot
claim dole or seek other work  as under Spanish law he is still
tied to his former company while it files for administration 
  All we want is that the judge and the labour authorities
reach a decision as soon as possible so we can claim dole or get
a job with another company   he told Reuters at a commercial
court in Madrid where he and fellow former employees have put in
a plea to break their ties with the company 
  This is like a charity case now  
 Married with two adult children  he said he used to earn up
to 1 300 euros   1 869  per month  His mortgage now costs 1 300
euros per month 
  They started docking our salaries in May   he said  his
hands thrust into the pockets of a blue corduroy jacket in the
cold December wind outside the wrought iron doors of the court 
  In July the company stopped paying altogether  That s
nearly six months  up to now  We are living off loans from
friends and family  
 
 DISCRIMINATION
 Ripples from a crumbling construction sector are spreading
out into the wider economy  bringing down peripheral businesses
like air conditioning installers and tile manufacturers 
 The number of Spanish companies entering administration in
the third quarter nearly quadrupled from the year ago period 
according to the National Statistics Institute 
  It s the domino effect from the construction sector   said
Jose Luis Corell Badia  a Valencia based lawyer and head of
corporate restructuring at Ernst   Young Abogados   I don t see
light at the end of the tunnel  It s job destruction  
 Cristina Ballesteros  a 29 year old former secretary for the
vice president of a multinational cement company  said
competition for work is such that potential employers ask her if
she plans to have children  even though it is illegal to do so 
 She lives with her boyfriend but has taken to saying she is
single to improve her chances 
  I share a rented flat  but if it was not for that I d be
back living with my mother   she said  
  I studied to be a secretary  it s not a degree  it s a
two year diploma  but now I find there are many employers who
want you to have a degree to do a secretary s job  People accept
it  because they have no choice  They are asking for more and
more  when it s really not necessary  
 Outside the Madrid commercial court  others are fighting to
receive payments to which they are entitled  Rafael Pliego  54 
was recently fired from his job as a security guard and has
already signed up for dole but not yet received his cheque 
  I have an illness and they told me I couldn t continue
working and they fired me  It happened on Oct  30  I had only
been working with them for five months   he said 
  I carry on looking for work  of course  I had the bad luck
to get sick  and this happened  
 
 BALLOONING DEFICIT
 Spain s government ran the second highest surplus in the
euro zone in 2007  equal to 2 2 percent of GDP  but the public
accounts are sinking into the red as tax income falls and the
number of people claiming unemployment benefit rises 
 The central government budget deficit leapt to 14 billion
euros in the first 11 months of 2008    equivalent to 1 28
percent of GDP  The central government deficit is part of
Spain s wider public sector budget  which includes the social
security system  regional and municipal accounts 
 Social security payouts alone in 2009 will double to 3 0
percent of gross domestic product  according to FUNCAS savings
bank consultancy 
  It s grown this year at an incredible rate   said FUNCAS
analyst Angel Laborda 
 FUNCAS forecasts for the budget deficit in 2009 and 2010 are
already obsolete  he said  and will probably come in at around 6
percent of GDP in 2009 and 7 5 percent in 2010 
 That would shatter a European Union limit of 3 percent of
GDP 
 Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on Saturday
the country would start to see the first shoots of economic
recovery within the coming year 
  The first signs of economic recovery  in the government s
opinion  will be in the second part  towards the end of 2009  We
will be at a point when confidence starts to recover   he said
in an interview broadcast on his party s Web site 
 But Vicente Balmaseda  36  who lost his job as a conference
stand designer six months ago and has been studying to improve

180612,402128,TPR,Foreign jobs slow corporate climb  study says,news,"By Ellen Wulfhorst
 NEW YORK  Aug 11  Reuters    Foreign job postings slow the
climb up the corporate ladder for executives  according to
research presented at the annual meeting of the Academy of
Management  which ended on Tuesday 
 A chief executive without an overseas work background
reaches the top job about two years sooner than those who went
abroad  said Monika Hamori  professor of management at IE
Business School in Madrid 
 The more assignments and the longer time spent outside the
home organization  the longer it takes  she said 
  The results show that executives with international
assignment experience take longer to reach the top echelon  
said Hamori  who with IE colleague Burak Koyuncu studied the
careers of chief executives at companies on the S P 500 and
Financial Times Europe 500 indices 
  Our findings suggest that you advance faster if you are in
proximity to the corporate headquarters  social networks than
if you are on assignment abroad  
 With a few exceptions  foreign divisions represent the
periphery  far from companies  centers of power  she said 
 The average chief executive is appointed to the top job in
24 83 years from the start of his or her career but those with
international assignments take 1 96 years longer than those
without international experience  the researchers found 
  Do it for a year or two  do it when you re young and don t
switch companies when you get back   said Hamori 
 One third of the chief executives in the study had
international assignments 
 A separate study presented in Chicago to the Academy of
Management  which groups some 19 000 members from 102 nations 
found that working for a company with a strong identity is more
effective for getting ahead than is individual performance 
 A position at a well known company with lower pay and less
responsibility serves better than does a high paying job at a
little known company  according to research by Dan Halgin of
the University of Kentucky  who analyzed the careers of U S 
university and college basketball coaches 
 Coaches associated with prominent so called coaching groups
   those at well known schools with coaching dynasties or those
who worked with coaching legends    landed more prestigious
jobs than those who did not  he found 
 The previous win loss records of their teams was not a
factor in gaining the plum jobs  he said 
 Halgin studied NCAA Men s Division I basketball coaches for
seven years  when there were 282 coaching changes  Eighty of
those were coaches who belonged to prominent coaching groups
and they got better jobs than did the others  he said 
 Being associated with a prominent coaching group also
mattered more than did a coach s overall winning percentage 
the prestige of the coach s most recent employer or the number
of NCAA tournaments the coach s teams played in  he said

180613,402129,TPR,Opel workers protest threatened Belgian closure,news,"By Antonia van de Velde
 ANTWERP  Belgium  Sept 23  Reuters    More than 2 000 Opel
workers and union leaders from across Europe protested on
Wednesday against the threatened closure of the carmaker s plant
in Belgium 
 Canadian automotive supplier Magna and Russian partner
Sberbank have agreed to buy a majority stake in Opel  the
European arm of General Motors  and are in talks to work out the
final details 
 They plan to cut about 10 500 jobs from an Opel workforce of
50 000  half of whom work in Germany 
  We re not prepared to accept plant closures anywhere in
Europe   said John Fetherston  union representative for
Ellesmere Port  one of two Opel plants in Britain 
 Estimates on the numbers present varied from 2 500 to 5 000 
More than 20 coach loads of workers arrived from Germany 
Spanish and British union officials were also present 
  We are here to show our solidarity with our Antwerp
colleagues  If we do not fight it could be Bochum  Luton or
Zaragoza tomorrow   Peter Scherrer  general secretary of the
European Metalworkers  Federation  told the crowd 
 Magna has said that it will keep all four German factories
open and could close the Antwerp plant in Belgium that is losing
production of the Astra hatchback 
 The European Commission issued a statement on Wednesday
repeating that it would examine whether Germany has tied 4 5
billion euros   6 66 billion  in promised state aid to the
preservation of plants there 
 Any plant closure is likely to be based solely on commercial
considerations  although there is no consensus on these 
 Opel Chairman Carl Peter Forster has rebutted a report in
German magazine Der Spiegel that said Antwerp was more
profitable than its rival site in Bochum  Germany 
 Kris Peeters  the premier of the Flanders region  told the
Flemish parliament on Tuesday that Opel s plant in Antwerp was
indeed cheaper if adjustments were made to take into account the
level of production 
 Opel labour leader Klaus Franz told Reuters he hoped
negotiations on staffing levels and productivity could wrap up
quickly  reiterating labour s offer to chop 265 million euros
each year from structural costs 
  We all see the need for restructuring and capacity
adjustments  but every job has a face that goes along with it
and we want to do this in a socially acceptable way    no plant
closures and no forced layoffs   he said 
  Opel s labour appeals to each European country not to
encumber the talks with nationalistic interests

180623,402139,TPR,Apparel Stocks Earnings Slated For Oct 25  UA  COH  RCKY ,opinion,"After encountering the rough tides arising from the sluggishness witnessed in emerging markets such as China and Brazil  and the fears of challenging economic political conditions in Europe post Brexit  the U S  economy looks much steady now  and is geared up for the reporting cycle  The Q3 earnings season is underway  with results from 116 S P 500 members 
Per the latest  report as of Oct 21  out of the 116 S P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers  approximately 80 2  have posted positive earnings surprises  while 62 9  beat top line expectations  According to the report  earnings for the 116 S P 500 companies that have reported so far are up 3 3  from the same period last year  while revenues have increased 1 8  
Further  the report projects that earnings for the total S P 500 companies will improve 0 1  from the year ago period  and total revenue will grow 1 5   Well  as the earnings season gets into groove  the scenario would become much more transparent 
The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector  and of the 16 Zacks sectors  7 are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter  with Autos  Oil Energy and Transportation being a big drag  However  the Consumer Discretionary sector is showing some resilience with total earnings expected to edge down 0 1   while revenue is anticipated to surge 11 7  
As of Oct 21  17 1  of the total number of S P 500 companies in this sector has reported their results  wherein 83 3  beat both earnings and revenue estimates  While earnings jumped 7  year over year  revenues advanced 8 6  Apparel is a part of the Consumer Discretionary sector 
Among Apparel stocks lined up to report on Oct 25  let s take a sneak peek at three companies 
Under Armour  Inc    NYSE UA    the developer  marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel  footwear  and accessories  is slated to report third quarter 2016 results  The company s sustained focus on brand development  expansion of its DTC business  product innovation and foray into the technology based fitness business bode well  as evident from its revenue growth of over 20  for the past 25 straight quarters  At the moment  management envisions net revenue to increase approximately 20  in the third quarter and 24  in 2016 
However  Under Armour anticipates gross margin to be marginally down during third quarter 2016 and for the full year  The company expects SG A expense to rise approximately 28  in 2016 owing to investment activities  Additionally  Under Armour projects an increase in interest expense to approximately  32 million in 2016 on account of higher debt levels  These are likely to weigh on the company s bottom line  thus posing concerns   Read    UNDER ARMOUR A Price and EPS Surprise

   Our criteria of earnings beat has been let down by an  of 0 00   as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 25 cents  In the trailing four quarters  the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 26   Under Armour currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Coach  Inc    NYSE COH    the designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts and house of lifestyle brands is expected to release first quarter fiscal 2017 results  Coach is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets  The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman has been accretive to its performance and is being viewed as a significant step in its efforts toward becoming a multi brand company  Moreover  management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product  stores and marketing  which are likely to have a favorable impact in the quarter to be reported 
These initiatives seem feasible given a mature domestic market  foreign currency headwinds and cautious consumer spending  Coach sells products that are discretionary in nature and consequently depends upon consumers  disposable income  which is sensitive to macroeconomic factors  Additionally  fashion obsolescence remains the main concern for the company s business model 
Coach carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter stands at 44 cents   Read     In the trailing four quarters  the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7 4  COACH INC Price and EPS Surprise

After weak reports from Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE  and Coach Inc  NYSE COH   luxury brands appear to be unravelling  This doesn t bode well for Michael Kors who reports its second quarter results tomorrow  before the market opens  Shares of the luxury brand have risen 25  this year on consecutive beats and strong comparables  Unfortunately  the retail sector has been choppy lately and with a large exposure to volatile international markets both earnings and revenue could see their first downturn in over a year  Estimates are seeing downward revisions activity ahead of its report  typically a sign of a miss on the horizon 
The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share of 76 cents  down 12  from the same period last year  That estimate has dropped 11  since KORS most recent report in June  Revenue is anticipated 3  lower at 958 23 million  marking the first quarter of negative comparisons in over 2 years  Don t expect the market to take a miss lightly either  Kate Spade s dismal report pushed its stock nearly 20  lower the next day 
The main focus of tomorrow s earnings report will likely be comps  In the past  strong comps were driven by new store openings  expanding existing outlets and building out its omnichannel capabilities  But the retail environment is more challenging these days  Luxury brands and longtime status symbols are simply not resonating with consumers like they have in the past  As a result we have seen a great deal of discounting from key brands including Michael Kors  Discounting may very well drive sales but it also puts pressure on margins 
Michael Kors also generates a large portion of its sales outside the United States  Its broad international exposure leaves them especially prone to currency headwinds  The strength of the dollar could also be mentioned if we see margins and profitability contract this quarter  Fortunately  the bar is set pretty low so it is not impossible for the company to top expectations and see a pop in the stock

180639,402155,TPR,Chinese Fashion  How To Invest In Popular American Imports,opinion,"Everybody needs clothes  It s one of our three basic needs 
China  a nation of 1 3 billion bodies  needs a lot of clothes 
Yes  we re back with another piece on  what s in with China s middle class   Our last article focused on the country s expanding outbound tourism market 
This time  we re talking fashion 
Chinese consumers spend more of their disposable income on clothes than folks in the United States  The Chinese middle class  in particular  spends around 10  of its income on clothing  That s roughly twice the percentage of income that Americans spend 
In the last two decades  Chinese entrepreneurs have rolled out many homegrown fashion brands  such as Chow Tai Fook  They ve captured a respectable share of their market  too  But American luxury goods remain a status symbol 
As a result  the rising incomes of China s middle class consumers are great news for clothing importers 
This trend should translate into rising profits for U S  retailers  We ve rounded up three ways for American investors to cash in on Chinese fashion spending 



 
First is Coach Inc  NYSE COH   The luxury handbag maker has had lots of success among Chinese socialites  You can see this in the brand s extensive China oriented marketing efforts  It even has a designated  china coach com  website 
Another heavy hitter in the Chinese fashion market is PVH Corp  NYSE PVH   It s the maker of several globally known fashion brands  Most notably  it owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein  Both lines rank among the most visible brands in China today 
Finally  there s Nike  NYSE NKE   Its products can be found almost anywhere there are athletes  China is no exception  Among China s urban elite  Nike doesn t have quite the same luxury flair as the other brands listed here  but it s still a popular fashion statement in poorer rural areas and small cities 
As you can see   Made in the USA  is a powerful label for Chinese consumers  In fact  it seems to evoke the exact opposite emotion that  Made in China  conjures up here

180655,402171,TPR,Kate Spade  KATE  Plunges 20  On Profit Miss  Slashed Forecast,opinion,"On Wednesday  shares of luxury retailer and handbag maker Kate Spade   Co    NYSE KATE   plunged  down over 20  in morning trading after the company reported disappointing quarterly profit thanks to weakening sales to tourists 
Kate Spade reported diluted earnings per share of  0 11  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 14 per share  Net income came in at  27 million for the second quarter  Total revenues  however  increased 14  to  320 million  beating our consensus estimate of  318 million 
 Several factors contributed to our second quarter results falling short of our expectations  the most impactful of which are the retail landscape and continuing tourist headwinds   said CEO Craig A  Leavitt in a statement    As we navigate these broader industry trends  we remain very confident in our long term growth initiatives and have a number of strategies in place to drive our business in the second half of 2016   We continue to focus on the factors we can control  executing our long term strategy and continuing to grow as a global  multi channel lifestyle brand  
As a result of its weak quarterly performance  Kate Spade slashed its full year forecast  with earnings per share now expected to fall in the range of  0 63  0 79  down sharply from previous estimates of  0 70  0 80 per share  The forecast for net sales has also been cut  and the company is now expecting to bring in revenues in the range of  1 37  1 40 billion  down from  1 39  1 41 billion 
The Future
Like many other retailers  Kate Spade has been focused on reducing the number of promotions in its brick and mortar stores  This  in addition to the declining number of tourists visiting the U S  because of the strong dollar  has led to a slowdown in foot traffic  which in turn has forced Kate Spade to mark down their products 
But as the handbag industry in North America slows down  and competition from rivals like Michael Kors   NYSE KORS    Coach Inc    NYSE COH    and privately held Tory Burch heats up  Kate Spade has expanded its home and lifestyle selection  Consumers can now purchase things like furniture  lighting  rugs  and apparel for women and children all under the Kate Spade brand 
The company has also made efforts to increase its ship from store presence  a way to help Kate Spade sell more full price items by shipping products bought online from its stores 
KATE is currently a  2  Buy  ranked stock on the Zacks Rank ",2016-08-03,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/kate-spade-(kate)-plunges-20-on-profit-miss,-slashed-forecast-200145858",200145858
180656,402172,TPR,3 Stocks To Watch Before The Bell,opinion,"Coach Inc  NYSE COH   Kate Spade  NYSE KATE  kicked off earnings season for luxury brands on quite a sour note  After missing expectations the stock plunged over 20   Unfortunately a weak quarter from KATE might bode well for  and other luxury brands reporting this week  Coach has only recently dug itself out of the hole  In the past 12 months shares are up 27  as comparable store sales begin to gain traction  North American comparables have steadily improved after comps declined by double digits every quarter last year  The new Disney collection along with an emphasize on lower price merchandise and e commerce growth have helped drive sales  The problem with discounting is that it takes a toll on gross margins  Coach outlets currently account for 65  of total revenue  so it might be difficult to avoid weak margins 
Whitewave Foods  NYSE WWAV   Last month Danone announced it would purchase  for  56 25 per share  WhiteWave is currently trading below the buyout price but strong earnings and forward guidance could easily send the stock past that number  The shift in consumer preferences towards natural and organic food has driven demand for many of WhiteWave s products  Revenue has steadily increased throughout the year while earnings have also shown improvement  Last quarter featured a beat on both the top and bottom line which caused the stock to pop almost 10   This quarter might turn out differently though given the recent takeover  The conference call will shed some light on the deal and its impact on future quarters
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  NASDAQ RRGB    has made a habit of missing revenue estimates and beating on earnings  The last 4 quarters have followed this trend as rising costs and softer consumer demand take their toll  Shares are down almost 46  in the past 12 months with very few signs of picking up anytime soon  Higher labor costs coupled with rising beef prices aren t helping the burger chain hit its numbers  Nonetheless the company has taken initiatives to improve traffic and comparable store sales  They include menu innovations  renovation projects and using technology to improve the customer experience ",2016-08-09,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-before-the-market-opens-tomorrow-200146776,200146776

Commentary Market sentiment made another step in the right direction today  With T2108 closing at 31 0   the market printed strong follow through to Friday s impressive bounce from oversold conditions  T2108 ended 6 days trading below 30   This duration is around the mean amount of time for a trip below 30   However  the chart below shows that the 46 days below 40  is an extremely long time  This is still a market under pressure 

Mean and Median Duration Below Given T2108 Threshold
The S P 500  N SPY  gained a healthy 1 7  on the day  This is the second day in a row of gains  As the chart below shows  the index has not been able to string THREE days in a row of gains since the last gasps of the Santa Claus rally in late December  Yet one more way to appreciate the kind of selling pressure that has dominated the action in 2016 
The S P 500 follows through on a sharp rebound off oversold conditions 
Tuesday s move confirms once again overhead resistance for the VIX  but the trend remains up thanks to both the 20 and 50DMAs 
The volatility index  the VIX  fails to break resistance at its 2012 intraday high yet again 
Given the uptrend and the heavy selling pressure for almost two months  I am VERY surprised that the VIX has remained relatively well contained  That selling pressure included THREE oversold periods  one of which took T2108 all the way to low single digits just last month  Something does not  add up  here  Either there is some kind of bullish divergence occurring between the relatively tame VIX and the long suffering S P 500 or there is some kind of pressure building for a future volatility surge  Traders certainly cannot get comfortable under these circumstances 
If the Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  maintains the current overnight sell off at the time of writing  the S P 500 is looking at ending another winning streak at two days 
The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  has taken a steep dive in overnight trading  It looks ready to resume its sell off and thus take stock markets with it 
I used the day s rally to pick some last hedges against bullishness  I am now going to sit tight from here and see what happens 
One of my more intriguing longs is probably Coach Inc  N COH   I missed the neat bounce off 50DMA support on Friday  but I jumped in right at the open 

Coach  COH  appears to be on an extended recovery  The bullish 200DDMA breakout from January has apparently and neatly survived its first test 
Given JP Morgan Chase  N JPM  helped to mark the latest bottom  I am now watching the stock closely  As I suspected in the last T2108 Update  Friday s gap up that created a bullish abandoned baby bottom likely drained a lot of energy from buyers for now  JPM still faces stiff resistance at recent highs and then the 50DMA after that 

JP Morgan Chase  JPM  has made a definitively bullish bottom  but it may be stuck in the recent churn for some time consolidating bullish energy 
Finally  in the last T2108 Update I promised something on gold and silver  I got gold covered here      One of the comments on that piece made me look into the gold oil ratio  One word  WOW  An all time high  Something has to give

180699,402215,TPR,Will Kate Spade Follow Competitors Down The Earnings Runway ,opinion,"Kate Spade  NYSE KATE  is the last of the premium handbag companies to report for the fourth quarter releases results before today s opening bell   currently has an Estimize EPS consensus of  0 26  a penny below the Wall Street consensus  suggesting the Estimize community is looking for a miss  While this denotes EPS growth of 73  over Q4 2013  revenues are expected to show a 8  decline  So what s going on here 

Kate Spade admittedly had to offer deep discounts over the holiday season to compete with the likes of   NYSE COH  and   NYSE KORS   At times those discounts got as high as 50  off  But they weren t alone  because their competitors had to offer the same to drum up traffic  This is just another sign that specialty retail names aren t getting as much of the love during the current low gas improving employment environment which should translate to great things for the retailers  Consumers seem more willing to allocate disposable income towards electronics 
The company also recently announced the closing of their Kate Spade Saturday and Jack Spade lower priced offshoots  Such lower priced spin offs  which were all the rage during the recession as a means to garner more business and woo younger shoppers  offer thinner profit margins  but more alarmingly they dilute the premium brand  making the items less special 
Coach struggled with this when they opened outlet stores  and there are some early signs that Kors is heading in this direction too  as products become too accessible  In 2015  specialty retailers will focus more closely on their premium brands as a means of holding on to their high end consumers ",2015-03-03,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-kate-spade-follow-competitors-coach-and-kors-down-the-earnings-runw-243639,243639

This  to me  represents an attractive short opportunity because not only are we at the upper end of the range shown above  but viewed in the larger context  you can see that Coach  which has been in its own private bear market since August 2012  incredibly  is vulnerable to having this range taken out to the downside to continue its weakness ",2014-12-22,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/coach:-now-an-attractive-short-opportun-236601,236601

180735,402251,TPR,Is Michael Kors Finally Showing A Crack In Its Armor ,opinion,"Michael Kors Holdings Ltd   NYSE KORS  has done it again  Wednesday morning the luxury fashion company topped the Estimize consensus on sales for the 9th consecutive quarter and beat the earnings forecast for the 8th time out of the past 9 opportunities   Sales dropped off slightly as expected from the incredible  1 billion holiday quarter  which is almost always the strongest period of the year for retailers  Michael Kors has continued to impress  although this quarter the company may have shown a crack in its armor 

There were many positive takeaways from KORS s quarterly financial performance  but that didn t stop a few shaky hands from cashing out their shares in early morning trading action  KORS stock was trading lower in pre market action and Initial selling after the opening bell saw KORS shares drop as low as  91 80 before rebounding and drifting higher as one would expect on average after a company beats the Estimize earnings consensus  KORS roared back for an intraday gain all the way up to  97 01  or a 5 7  increase from the morning s bottom 

The graph above from ChartIQ above shows the positive post earnings drift KORS experienced on Wednesday after the open  The far left side of the chart shows that Michael Kors opened the day s trading marginally lower than it closed on Tuesday  And while the majority of the news from KORS was positive on Wednesday  there may be a legitimate concern or two in the earnings release as well 

CNBC contributor  journalist  and blogger at TheStreet com Herb Greenberg laid out the bear case yesterday morning  Mr  Greenberg was quick to caveat that this quarter has been weak across the board in retail  His argument about KORS zeroed in on the company s quarterly gross margin  Michael Kors s gross margin  gross profit net sales  came in at 59 9   compared to 59 7  in last quarter  Gross margin did increase slightly compared to the previous quarter  but it also narrowly missed compared to 60 1  a year earlier  Greenberg drives home his bear case with this   Reality  If this were a genuine beat on revenue and earnings the company  arguably  would have also beat on margins   Any discounting KORS may have used use to drive its great 54  year over year revenue growth and management s warnings of  normalization  in margins in the future are a concern worth talking about 

There is a fine line to ride in the  affordable luxury  market  Companies like Michael Kors must balance marketing products that are within reach for much of the middle class at high prices with protecting against brand dilution  It s not an easy task 
Not too many years ago Coach  NYSE COH  was the dominant player in the handbag industry  Then you saw fake Coach bags on every corner of Canal Street selling for  20  Suddenly everyone and their mother had a  Coach  bag  Many of the bags you d see people with were knock offs  but suddenly it wasn t nearly as desirable to be seen rocking Coach  Discounting your products isn t quite the same as getting ripped off by imitators  but there is a similarity  Once your brand becomes diluted  its hard to go back to asking consumers for the prices that fetch high margins  Once the market is saturated with Michael Kors bags  it wouldn t be as cool to have one 
There is a certain irreversibility to discounting  once a brand becomes cheaper and more common  luxury consumers won t be willing to shell out for the steeper price tags  Brands are always rising and falling in America  That couldn t be more true in the world of fashion were consumer behavior is dictated in large part by the public perception of brands  Thus far Michael Kors has had a captivating run  Can the company keep the magic up  Or as the bears imply  will the decline in KORS s gross margins cut into future earnings potential and limit forward profitability  Head over to the Estimize com platform and submit your own estimates on KORS and other fashion retailers to see how your own predictions stack up to Wall Street and the pros ",2014-05-30,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-michael-kors-finally-showing-a-crack-in-its-armor-214424,214424
180736,402252,TPR,Are Growth Stocks Bad Investment Vehicles ,opinion,"Earlier today  I tweeted a joke about the performance of Coach Inc  NYSE COH 

And yes  I didn t account for the dividend that Coach paid  but you get my point What is more interesting is some of the reactions I received on social media 

First of all  let me tell you that I love the fact that people have  a disdain towards growth stocks  The recent declines in many cloud  Internet and social media stocks have scared people out of story momentum stocks  This sentiment is usually a good foundation for future outperformance of this asset class 
For a market approach to work in the long term  it has to go through periods of underperformance  when most people lose faith in it  It is the law of the market and it applies to both value and momentum 
If your strategy is to buy and hold forever  growth stocks are not for you   Go buy a few boring  dividend paying consumer staples at a fair price and you will do well over time  It is not an accident that Buffett likes to buy only businesses  which circumstances are not going to change substantially in the next decade  Guess what   if a business doesn t change too much in 10 years  it is very likely that it won t do much better than the market itself 
If your goal is to trump the market averages  growth stocks are the place to be 
It is true that many growth names will go up 300 400  in a couple years  only to give back 50  to 90  of their appreciation afterwards  Does that mean that you have to ride those stocks all the way down  Does that mean that you have to look at the glass as half empty  No  If you have a proper exit strategy  you will protect the majority of your profits and then re invest the proceeds in other emerging growth names 
Some trends last 3 months  some trends last 2 years  others last 10  Eventually  every price trend and every growth story comes to an end  This end could be very different  depending on your exit rules

180737,402253,TPR,Is Michael Kors About To Pull A Coach  ,opinion,"Since exploding onto the financial scene with its December 2011 IPO  luxury fashion company Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS  has been one of the hottest names on the market  Kors  strength is particularly impressive because few industries in the financial world are as fickle as fashion  Brands rise and fall each season as different looks come into and go out of style  The stocks behind the labels ride enormous waves of strength with popularity  and suffer terrible bouts of selling when retailers need to discount products to get them off the shelves  Over the past couple of years Kors has been on fire  but there are warning signs that Kors could be about to lose its spot on top 

The price of KORS shares took a tumble in July  and some analysts fear that the company could be in for a relatively weak quarter  Michael Kors products have been in vogue for years  but consumers in the fashion market can change their minds on a dime  Concerns primarily stem from the ubiquity of Kors products and worry over excessive discounting  In the high end fashion market exclusivity often plays a large hand in the popularity of brands  It wasn t too long ago that Coach Inc  NYSE COH  was the king of the hill in handbags 
Coach has been in a tailspin for years now  The company s stock price has been deteriorating since early 2012 and the financial fundamentals have been stagnant  or worse 

Not too long ago Coach was the dominant player in the handbag industry  Then fake Coach bags started popping up on every corner of Canal Street selling for  20  Suddenly  Coach  bags were everywhere  Many of the bags you d see people with were knock offs  but suddenly it wasn t nearly as cool to be seen rocking Coach  Discounting your products isn t quite the same as getting ripped off by imitators  but there is an important similarity  Once a brand becomes diluted  its hard to go back to asking consumers for the luxury prices that fetch high margins  Once the market is saturated with Michael Kors bags  it won t be nearly as desirable to have one 


The Michael Kors company is on an outstanding financial run  Michael Kors has beaten the Wall Street earnings consensus in 8 straight quarters and has at least lived up to expectations from Estimize 7 of 8 times 
This quarter the contributing buy side and independent analysts on Estimize are forecasting that Kors will keep its streak of topping the Street s consensus unblemished  However  this quarter 6 of 44 analysts on Estimize are expecting Kors to miss  There is much more uncertainty around KORS this quarter than ever before  Divided opinion is evident by the price action  Some investors are have been dumping shares ahead of the earnings report  driving the price down 


Although shares of KORS have fallen in recent weeks  contributors on Estimize also expect the company to beat sales estimates  While earnings and sales are extremely useful fundamentals to watch  there may be a more important number to look for on Monday 
As mentioned previously  luxury fashion brands such as Michael Kors rely on their image to demand high margins  The fastest way to see how healthy the Kors brand is will be to immediately look at this quarter s gross margin  Last quarter Kors reported a gross margin of 59 9   down ever so slightly from 60 1  a year earlier 
Competing in fashion requires walking a fine line between growing sales and protecting the company s brand  So far Kors has done an excellent job in maintaining an attractive brand while offering products at a variety of price points  a very difficult balance to maintain 


At the end of the day what s been propelling Kors forward is the remarkable rate of growth in both earnings and revenue while holding onto high margins  
On Monday the Estimize community is looking for Michael Kors to post year over year earnings growth of 39  and to increase sales by 37  compared to the same quarter of last year  These numbers are both quite high  but are totally reasonably given the even faster rate of growth reported over the past year ",2014-08-03,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-michael-kors-about-to-pull-a-coach-221402,221402
180738,402254,TPR,Which Luxury Brand Stock Is Best For Your Portfolio ,opinion,"Overall  the retail sector has taken a beating this earnings season  with many discount retailers taking the brunt of the damage  However  investors have also seen severe weakness in luxury names too  such as Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS   Coach Inc  NYSE COH   and Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE   Let s take a closer look at these three important companies and see how they have done with their recent reports in this shaky environment 
The Demise of Michael Kors  Shares
Michael Kors announced impressive earnings that crushed estimates during the conference call on August 4th during pre market hours  For unlucky traders and investors though  KORS CEO John Idol quickly turned the atmosphere from a buoyant one to a depressing one  as shares tumbled from a high of  92 to a low of approximately  82  This alarmed investors especially when KORS had crushed all revenue  profit  EPS  sales  and even Gross Margin estimates  in its first fiscal quarter of 2015  John Idol discouraged investors and traders by informing them that KORS has had too many promotions  and that it has grown too rapidly in the American market  Investors also showed concerns regarding inventory and margins  Sales in Europe were excellent though  with revenue growth of about 128   while revenue in Japan also burgeoned by about 89   This was not enough to counter the negative sentiments of the investors as they quickly dumped the stock  The sharp green to red reversal has also pressed many analysts who had high hopes for the stock  to take a closer look at the company  though recent estimates seem to have focused on a solid outlook for the company

COH beat most of its estimates  but it did not soar as high as many thought it would  This was partly due to how KORS and KATE have managed to steal sales from COH  Nevertheless  COH beat Q4 estimates on its August 5th conference call almost everywhere except for sales in the US  which fell by around 16  from last year  COH posted EPS of  0 59 which was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 54  and international sales surged by 7  during the quarter  This was not sufficient though as costs rose  and men s footwear sales were depressing  COH was up approximately 7  in pre market trading during the conference call  but later plunged back to once again depress investors  COH opened on August 5 at  35 32 share and closed at  35 80 share  This gave those investing in luxury retail a break from KORS s collapse 
Kate Spade Makes a U turn  Investors Devastated
KATE s earnings were not too pleasing  August 13th marked KATE s conference call with its COO  George Carrara  who had reported a Q2 loss of about  4 4 million  or  0 03 share  On the bright side  net sales rose to  266 million  or roughly 49   KATE shares skyrocketed during pre market trading  but made a complete turnaround as the stock tanked a whopping 25   The fashion firm s gross margin was also threatened with a 3 2  decrease on that front 
KATE s executives did not intend to compete with other luxury brands through the use of promotions and sales  but were forced to do so  in order to drive revenues 
Bottom Line
KATE holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and many investors could look to seize this buying opportunity as KATE s current price is a great entry point  KORS maintains a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and as of now  it stands at a very attractive price  On the other hand  COH is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   This is due to the fact that it has shunned away investors with the bad news  Perhaps KORS and KATE have become better retailers and stocks than COH  and given their recent performances  could be interesting picks at current levels for those willing to push through significant volatility ",2014-08-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/which-luxury-brand-stock-is-best-for-your-portfolio-222747,222747

180760,402276,TPR,Is That A Bear Market Ahead ,opinion,"With bearish momentum increasing and stocks testing key support levels in recent days  one of the biggest questions on your mind may be whether or not recent price action is merely a normal bull market correction or the very early stages of a new bear market 
If I had the psychic ability to know these things with 100  certainty  I would already be topping the Forbes 400 list  incidentally  never believe anyone who tells you any  certainties  about the stock market  
But what I can tell you with the utmost confidence is that basic technical analysis concepts such as support and resistance definitely work a majority of the time at predicting the stock market s next move 
As such  let s take a look an objective look at the next major  long term support levels in both the Nasdaq 100 and S P 500 indices  using ETF charts for PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ  and SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   
By the end of my  no nonsense  analysis  you will know a few key price levels to watch that could determine whether or not a new bear market is on the horizon 
NASDAQ 100 ETF   PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ 
In an April 7   definitely worth a read if you missed it   I already showed you the  83 support level in QQQ  convergence of the February swing low  dominant uptrend line  and 40 week 200 day MA  
If QQQ breaks down below that pivotal level of support around the  83 area  it would put the NASDAQ 100 at least 9 10  below its recent 52 week high 
In a bull market  a  normal  and healthy pullback from the highs typically in the 5 10  range 
Therefore  if QQQ slides more than 10  below its March 2014 highs  price action in the NASDAQ could become quite negative for at least the next several months 

Next  let s pan out to a longer term view on the same monthly chart that goes all the way back to the lows of 2009 
In doing so  you can more clearly see the importance of that long term uptrend line  which has been in place for the past five years and has multiple anchor points along the way 

If you want to know when to expect a major change in market sentiment  I recommend you watch this 5 year uptrend line closely  as a breakdown below that level could lead to a new bear market in the NASDAQ 
However  even if a break of the long term trendline occurs  this scenario might not play out until 2015 because we are looking at a chart of the monthly time frame  each bar on the chart shows an entire month of price action  
If the 5 year uptrend line is broken  the next major support level would be found around  70  which is the last big base of price consolidation 
A test of consolidation at the  70 area would  officially  put the NASDAQ 100 in a bear market  as it would be 20  below its former 52 week high 
S P 500 ETF   SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY 
In the near term   SPY  S P 500  is in better technical shape than QQQ  NASDAQ 100   as it isn t still well above support of its prior swing low from February 
Further  the price of SPY must break below support of a multi year uptrend line  as well as the 10 month 200 day MA  just to pullback to the February swing low 

Although the S P has further to fall before being in danger of breaking its swing low  bearish momentum could indeed kick into high gear if that February swing low fails to hold 
If that occurs  the next decent support level for SPY would be around the  165 to  170 area  where there was a five month long base in 2013 
Beyond that  the next major support level for SPY is near the  155 level  which is support of the prior highs from 2000 and 2007  not shown on chart   Remember that a prior level of resistance technically becomes the new support  after the resistance is broken 
Still  as with the NASDAQ 100  bear in mind that a pullback of this magnitude would most likely not occur until 2015  and would also put SPY about 18 20  off its 52 week high 
What If The Bull Has Run Its Course 
A clear breakdown below the last major swing lows in the main stock market indexes would make for a very tough year for the equities markets  but it would not be very surprising 
Considering that the stock market has already been rallying for five years since the lows of 2009  it is very possible the bull market has already run its course  every stock market runs in cycles  
Overall  it s starting to look as though the rest of 2014 could be quite choppy  followed by an ugly 2015  if the charts break down on all time frames  
If stocks enter into a new bear market in 2015  it would obviously bad news for traditional  buy and hold  investors who must hope and pray that stocks continue on an upward trajectory forever  hint  they don t  
However   a new bear market would not bother me because I am a momentum swing trader  the trading system taught in my nightly stock trading newsletter is designed to profit in both uptrending and downtrending markets 
Bear Market Strategy  Just In Case 
In bull markets  my main focus is buying leading growth stocks as they breakout from valid bases of consolidation  as well as buying those same stocks on pullbacks  
But in bear markets  my strategy is a combination of selling short former leadership stocks as they break down and buying ETFs with low to nill correlation to the equities markets  such as commodities  currencies  fixed income and international  
When selling short in a bear market  I scan for former leadership stocks that had a strong rally over the course of several years  but have begun to fall apart and take a beating 
Most of the time  these stocks are about three to four months removed from their 52 week highs  and their 50 day moving averages are beginning to roll over as well 
The general idea is to sell short a former leader that is over owned by institutions  as it begins to rollover from the highs 
Because banks  mutual funds  hedge funds  and other institutions need to dump the huge positions they had accumulated  some of these monster movers will plummet up to 75  below their all time highs before they stabilize in price 
Coach Inc  NYSE COH    Stalking For A Breakdown
Coach is a decent example of what I would be looking for in selling short a former leading stock  though it has not actually broken down yet  
After bottoming out in 2009  COH put in a monster 500  rally off those lows 
It subsequently stalled out in 2012  and has basically been chopping around since then  forming lower highs while holding support at  45  This is shown on the monthly chart of COH below 

As indicated by the pink horizontal line  the  45 area has become a major level of price support 
As such  COH could easily drop to  30 in just a few weeks if the  45 level is broken 
Although COH has already pulled in about 40  off its all time high  it could easily become a  20 stock if support does not hold 
A Bit Early  But Be Prepared
In the big picture  it is still a bit early to be aggressively stalking the short side of the market  but COH is one of the stocks on my internal watchlist for potential short selling entry in the near term 
If  COH meets my specific criteria for a low risk short selling entry point  I will provide subscribers of The Wagner Daily newsletter with my exact entry  stop and target prices for the momentum trade setup 
Obviously  many other former leadership stocks will come onto my radar screen as well  providing for plenty of opportunities to profit on the short side of the market ",2014-04-08,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-that-a-bear-market-ahead-208995,208995
180761,402277,TPR,Coach  Growth In China Cannot Offset Weakness In North America,opinion,"Fashion is a fickle business  A brand can become a household name overnight if the right celebrity is seen wearing it  But all it takes is a single bad season  or a new fashion darling to catch the eye of the fashionistas  to torpedo a decades old premium brand 
Unfortunately for handbag and accessory maker Coach  NYSE COH     as well as the embattled holders of Coach stock   the winds of fashion appear to have shifted 
Shoppers   and particularly American shoppers   have fallen out of love with Coach s wares  And COH has been powerless to stop rival Michael Kors  Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS   from cutting deeply into its market share 
Quick Look at Coach Earnings
First quarter Coach earnings   and it wasn t pretty 
Sales were down 21  in North American stores open more than a year 
Company wide  sales were down 7  for the quarter  or 5  stripping out the effects of currency moves 
Not surprisingly given the sluggish sales  COH s margins took a hit across the board  gross margin fell to 71 1  from 74 1  a year ago  and operating margins tumbled to 23 9  from 29 3 
Earnings for the quarter declined from 84 cents per share in the first quarter of 2013 to 68 cents last quarter 
Investors didn t take the news well  shares of Coach stock are down more than 8  on the news 
Yet as dismal as the COH results were  there was a fair bit of good news buried in the press release 
For instance  Chinese sales rose 25   and Chinese same store sales rose at a double digit rate   and this despite the slowdown in the Chinese economy  International sales grew at 14  and 20  if you strip out the effects of currency moves  Sales of men s products were also  strong   though specifics were not provided in the press release  And management maintained the dividend of Coach stock at 33 75 cents  offering a yield of 2 9  at current prices 
So   what s an investor to do  Has Coach stock now become an attractive value play after the slide 
COH  One Big Hang Up
At first glance  there is a decent bit to like  Coach stock is relatively inexpensive  trading for less than 15 times consensus 2014 earnings estimates of  3 13 per share  And while margins have slipped  COH is still a wildly profitable company  Coach s return on equity has consistently been above 30  since 2001  COH also has been a dividend raising machine  more than tripling the quarterly payout to Coach stock since initiating a dividend in 2009 
And let s not forget the success the company has had in China and in pushing new product lines  such as accessories for men 
There s one big problem  however 
COH is still very dependent on American women  the key demographic that has abandoned the brand  543 of Coach s 1 011 stores are in North America  and the region accounts for 60  of sales  Another 199 stores are in Japan   a country with tepid domestic demand and a currency that I believe to be in terminal decline  COH has 147 stores in China and another 96 in other parts of Asia  Together  these make up nearly a quarter of Coach s store count 
So  an investment in Coach stock is essentially a bet that either the Coach brand stages a major comeback among American women  or that its popularity abroad surges ahead fast enough to compensate for declines in North America 
Sure  a fashion comeback could happen  However  accomplishing a turnaround in fashion is trickier than accomplishing one in  say  industrial machinery  Once a brand loses its cachet  it s hard to get it back 
What about international sales  Here  the outlook is better  and I expect Coach to benefit from a turnaround in emerging market currencies  But if the brand has lost its appeal among American women  it might be just a matter of time before their sisters in China and other emerging markets follow suit 
Bottom line  It s probably best to sit this one out for now  Avoid Coach stock

 Graphs from ChartIQ Visual Earnings 
Since their  25 debut on the market in December 2011  shares of Michael Kors Holdings Ltd  have steadily advanced to  97 68  nearly 4x their initial value  Over a similar timeframe Coach Inc  s stock has been nearly halved from a March 2012 high of  79 70 to its current price level below  42  The rise of Kors stock at the expense of Coach can be easily understood by doing a quick analysis of the two companies  underlying financial fundamentals 

Let s start with Coach  The earnings per share chart above from Estimize com shows Coach s quarterly profit in each of its past 8 fiscal quarters  In its past 2 quarterly earnings reports  Coach has seen falling profit and falling sales compared to the same quarter 1 year ago while in FQ1 2014 Coach reported flat earnings alongside declining revenue  

Recent history hasn t been great for Coach s fundamentals and shareholders have felt the impact  Back in January Coach reported  1 06 in earnings per share for a year over year quarterly drop of 14   At the end of last month the once king of the handbag industry completed an even worse quarter with profit declining 19  over the period on a yoy basis 

All the while  Michael Kors has been shattering expectations  The blue box surrounded by a magenta border above shows the range of estimates on KORS s earnings last quarter from 55 contributing analysts on the platform  Kors went well above and beyond even the most optimist analyst on Estimize com  Last quarter KORS beat the highest earnings estimate on the platform by a whopping 14c per share 
Estimize crowdsources forward looking financial estimates from hedge fund managers  financial professionals  nonprofessional investors  and students  According to Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB  Quantitative Research and an independent academic study from Rice University  the Estimize earnings consensus is not only more accurate than Wall Street on average  but it also tends to do a better job of representing the market s true expectations 

Over the past 8 quarters Michael Kors has met or exceeded the Estimize consensus on earnings 7 times  while beating sales expectations in every period  Michael Kors is set to report its next quarterly earnings report before the market opens on Wednesday  May 28th  Back in February KORS crushed all fundamental estimates from both Estimize and Wall Street and reported its first ever quarter of  1 billion in sales 
 
On Wednesday  the Estimize community is expecting KORS to report earnings of 76c per share and revenue of  857 37  These numbers would represent a 52  increase in and earnings and a 44  boost in sales on a year over year basis  Estimize contributors are setting the bar high for KORS  but the outlook still remains comfortably lower than the home run metrics KORS reported this holiday season for a 73  hike in yoy EPS and a 57  increase in yoy sales 

The most accurate analyst covering KORS on the Estimize com platform over the past 2 years is ZachLehner  an analyst who identifies as an independent research financial professional  Among all analysts who have made at least 2 scored predictions on Michael Kors  ZachLehner is the leader of the pack with an average points per estimate score of 14 90  Points are awarded to an analyst for being more accurate than Wall Street on a given estimate  Detailed rankings and statistics are provided to each contributor so analysts can learn about their own behavior  track their improvement over time  and see how they stack up to Wall Street and the pros  

As the scatterplot above shows  ZachLehner expects KORS to report in line with the Estimize community s consensus on EPS while coming up  5 37 million short on revenue  The scatterplot also shows that just 2 of 48 contributing analysts are predicting that KORS will miss the Wall Street consensus on EPS  Sentiment surrounding Michael Kors Holdings is overwhelmingly positive going into Wednesday s earnings release  The only question is  can KORS continue to stay in vogue by exceeding the high demands from the market ",2014-05-28,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/kors-in-style,-coach-is-not:-here's-why-214195",214195

180812,402328,TPR,Preliminary Steps To Binary Options Trading,opinion,Well before placing any orders or opening positions  prospective binary options traders should start by building a bankroll dedicated exclusively to this activity  This is the first thing that should be on anyone s mind  because mixing the funds destined for trading binary options with the money aimed at covering living expenses is a ruining error  Thanks to the leverage offered by most brokers  beginners can wager relatively large amounts without investing an equally impressive sum of money Speaking of which  those who are serious about beginning a binary options trading career should make sure that the broker they team up with can harbor their ambitions  This includes the creation of a proper environment  by offering software and the trading platform that are reliable and versatile  The broker should also charge relatively low commission and empower power the trader to choose between several deposit methods  Both deposits and withdrawals need to take as little time as possible  to allow the account owner to transfer funds freely in and out without unnecessary delays  Education Is The CornerstoneBinary options are very profitable if you know how to trade them  but there are certain risks involved in trading digital options  Proper research about options trading will prepare traders for the possible setbacks as well and remember them that  while being very different from gambling  it is still not exact science  On the other hand  risks are inherent in virtually any business  some of which are much less profitable  so the solution is not to steer clear from binary options  but learn how to master them  Try to learn more about the underlying asset explore both the fundamental and technical analysis and never stop researching In order to make yourself familiar with the advanced software the broker uses on its platform  sign up for a demo account first and perform a few trades if possible  If not  prepare paper trading plan  It works  The bottom line is that digital options trading should be approached with a clear mind and regarded as long term investment that requires patience  reasonable objectives and adequate trading strategies  Statistics show that those who take it one step at a time and tinker with demo accounts  achieve better results than those who jump headfirst and trade for real money Find Trustworthy Signal Providers A little help in the beginning goes a long way  and if traders sign up for a service providing binary options signals they can tap into the huge experience of veteran traders  These people do all the research and transmit the conclusions in the form of a concise signal that needs no advanced understanding of binary options trading to be interpreted  Human traders are superior to robots  because they can adjust the signals in such a well that they will meet your expectations  The link between risk and profit is indissoluble and when you aim high winnings  you should accept the possibility of suffering some loses One who makes decisions taking into consideration only the prospective profit is exposing himself to high risks  in a venture that resembles gambling more than investing  Having experience on his side and access to information that is comprehensive  enables the trader to take advantages of opportunities that the regular player will miss  To join a signal provider is the same as having your personal coach that will enable you to explore one of the most profitable  yet volatile markets ,2012-11-29,Martin Kay,https://www.investing.com/analysis/preliminary-steps-to-binary-options-trading-145537,145537
180813,402329,TPR,Sports Economics  Texas Longhorns Need A New CEO ,opinion,Since the Vince Young and Colt McCoy era the Texas Longhorns Football program has been in steep decline with a 21 win and 16 loss record over the last 3 years despite having financial resources  high end facilities  and top five recruiting classes that most University programs only dream about  Mack Brown makes over 5 million dollars a year  at the most valuable football program in the country estimated in the range of  800 million   Texas has recruiting advantages over their rivals for instance  Johnathan Gray a freshman running back at Texas who was highly coveted  well his father played football at Texas Tech  and poor Texas Tech couldn t even get a visit from the player  Texas often says   they don t recruit  they select  so for the last three years the Football program is just above 500 while selecting the best players in the state of Texas which is ground zero for division I players  Football is religion in the state of Texas and produces the most college football players along with Florida and California  So Texas is getting beat by all the players who weren t good enough to play at the University of Texas  i e   Texas didn t  select  them   Mack Brown has a lot of great qualities  he represents the University well off the field  great at Banquets  dealing with boosters  visiting hospitals and the soft coaching duties necessary at a high profile program like the University of Texas  But make no mistake  college football is big business these days  the longhorns are even trying to get their Longhorn Network off the ground to increase Texas prominence even more  The problem is this is all contingent on having an elite program  and Mack Brown is paid to win games  he is one of the highest paid coaches in college football due to the elevated expectations regarding having an elite winning program defined as top 5 in the polls each year with a major BCS bowl appearance annually   So Texas has the most financial resources at their disposal  high end facilities  the best recruits  great fan sponsorship  their pick of assistant coaches  and yet they are just a middle of the road average at best performer over the last three years  Mack Brown dealt with the poor performance by bringing in new assistant coaches hoping to deflect some of the pressure and criticism for the poor performance on the field  but the quality of performance remains average at best  It isn t just the record  it is the level of play that concerns critics the most  routinely getting blown out by interstate rivals  and putting on lackluster performances that have fans scratching their heads year after year   Last night Kansas State University fans chanted as the game was winding down  We own Texas  after beating them for five straight years  a KSU program that lacks all the advantages that Texas enjoys  all except one  a Great Head Coach  So Mack Brown is the only constant  he is really good at everything expected of a high profile coach except for the most fundamental aspect of his job coaching and leadership in setting the tone for exceptional performance on the field  The glad handing and relationship management is the icing on the cake  first and foremost you are paid to win games in the modern era of big time college football   The University of Texas Football Program is not getting a positive return on their investment in the head coach at this point  Mack Brown often positions himself as more of a CEO than a head coach  well the Texas program is starting to look like RIMM to Alabama s AAPL  and RIMM s sharp decline led to an executive change at the top  It is time for Texas to have a leadership change at the CEO level  before it becomes too late and their program has declined to the point where they are no longer  selecting  the best athletes in the state  but rather taking Texas A M s leftovers  Think in terms of HP  when a company declines too far  all the CEO changes in the world cannot turn a losing organization around ,2012-12-04,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sports-economics:-texas-longhorns-need-a-new-ceo-145970,145970

180815,402331,TPR,Is The Latest Pullback In Gold Silver Over  ,opinion,You play to win the game   You don t play to just play it   Herm Edwards  when he was head coach of the NY Jets   In order to win the gold silver game  spotting critical information and knowing how to use it can give us an edge over the rest of the market  Using the COT report as source of information has proved useful over the last 10 years  Last week I suggested that the COT report might show that hedge funds have started to chase the momentum of the gold market lower by shorting gold contracts  while the bullion bank cartel used the extra selling from hedge fund short selling to cover their shorts  I suggested this dynamic would likely mark a bottoming of this latest bullion bank paper market take down of the price of gold silver  The CME Comex Commitment of Traders report released Friday  which shows long short open interest positions by trader category through the previous Tuesday  shows that indeed the hedge funds began to short Comex gold futures in decent size and the bullion banks continued to aggressively cover their short positions  We ve watched the banks cover their shorts quite aggressively for the past few weeks  but when the short covering by the banks continues  aided by additional hedge fund shorting  it has over the past couple of years signaled that the metals are bottoming and getting to move a lot higher   It might not happen quickly  and this next week or two is usually characterized by low volume  directionless trading  but it is likely that gold and silver are now set up technically to move a lot higher  As we all know  this technical set up is reinforced by unprecedented fundamentals ,2012-12-25,David I.

180825,402341,TPR,Libor Scandal  Will Wall Street Run Out The Clock ,opinion,Dean Smith was a master practitioner as basketball coach at the University of North Carolina  While many fans of the game may not have appreciated the style of ball played by Coach Smith  he was focused on one thing  Winning  What was Coach Smith s signature style offensive strategy toward the end of games  The four corners  College basketball during a large part of Coach Smith s tenure operated without a shot clock so the team in possession of the ball often would spread the floor and run the clock down during the final stages of the game  The North Carolina Tar Heels under Coach Smith ran this  keepaway  style to perfection  We see a very similar version of this offensive  running the clock out  currently on Wall Street  How so  Let s navigate and address current developments in what I view as the largest financial scandal in history  that is the Libor scandal  The Wall Street Journal highlights the strategy being employed by the large financial titans in writing    U S  prosecutors are seeking more time to complete their investigation of alleged interest rate fixing  while banks ensnared in the probe are trying to turn the clock to their advantage as they battle lawsuits claiming damages from rate rigging  The Justice Department recently asked several banks to sign  tolling  agreements  in which the companies promise they won t challenge any enforcement action on the grounds that the alleged wrongdoing occurred beyond the statute of limitations  people close to the investigation said  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission  which is leading the civil arm of the U S  probe  asked the banks for tolling agreements earlier this year  people familiar with the matter said  It isn t clear how many banks have so far signed the Justice Department or CFTC agreements  A spokeswoman for the Justice Department and a CFTC spokesman declined to comment  Even as prosecutors continue the criminal probe  U S  officials have grown concerned that the investigation into whether banks manipulated the London interbank offered rate could be stymied by the statute of limitations  This can make it harder to punish firms or individuals for frauds that took place more than five years ago  A few comments and questions  1  There is evidence from traders  in the arena  so to speak that the manipulation of Libor went on as far back as the early 1990s  2  Do you think that the banks are working together to formulate a collective settlement in which they neither admit nor deny culpability  That approach has been the standard modus operandi  3  Why might regulators focus on individual traders when the enormous scope of this scandal would clearly indicate that senior executives within the banks had to have been aware of this manipulation  4  This previous question begs a follow up  What degree of confidence do we have in those in the striped shirts  those being our regulators and elected officials  to truly pursue total truth  transparency  and justice in this scandal  Do you think the large monied interests on Wall Street are reminding the  zebras  as to just how the game is played and officiated  Tick       tick       tick         The clock may not only be running down on this scandal BUT make no mistake that with each and every perversion of justice the clock is running out on America as well  Who amongst our regulators and elected officials are willing to play real defense on behalf of our country  I repeat what I have written previously and what Chris Whalen addressed in a commentary I highlighted yesterday    THERE SHOULD BE NO FINES  If senior bank executives are exposed and dealt with appropriately  Wall Street will not only survive but be stronger for it  As will America and the world at large ,2012-09-21,Larry Doyle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/libor-scandal:-will-wall-street-run-out-the-clock-137185,137185

180844,402360,TPR,Answers On A Postcard June 9th 2012,opinion,It is all very well giving our politicians  central bankers and assorted economists grief for just sitting around and tuning up for the next violin concerto  rather than putting out the fire that started in Greece and has now spread rapidly to Spain  but can anyone define exactly what sort of fire it is  If you use water to put out an electrical conflagration  at best you will get a nasty shock  at worst it will kill you The aforementioned group are in denial about shocking pain or death  But as the denouement approaches like an unbroken tsunami wave  they realise that the fan originated effluent will be on its way long before their tenure in office is over  There will be no one else to blame but themselves  although Obama may just get lucky as crises have a habit of going on for much longer than you can remain credible to misquote Keynes  something much in vogue these days So despite the headlines and the warnings of Armageddon from every blog site ex CNBC it would be unlikely that a wet weekend in June  they are building an ark down at the Lymington pier   would actually see the end of the world despite the Bernank failing to oblige with QE3 last week  Remarkably the S P had its best week of the year  but the announcement after the close that Moodys was looking to cut Spain s sovereign debt rating  that will almost certainly happen on Monday   and that Italy would not be far behind must have left anyone playing rigged casino feeling a little queasy  A state further compounded by the latest estimate of the Spanish bank bail out rising from  40 billion to  100 billion  Nor is it clear how Spain reciprocates as they are not keen on the German straight jacket  never mind the hair shirt  that they would almost certainly end up wearing for this amount of largesse Well you can t have it both ways  which is what most southern European politicians want  The solution to the vexatious problem seems on the surface to be a binary choice  You either go with full and accountable political and fiscal union  which has been the  hidden  agenda all along  or you admit that the whole idea of a common currency was stillborn from the off and go back to drachmas  pesetas  DMarks et al  Anyone who has ventured within spitting distance of a text book on social anthropology will understand that cultures are a long time in gestation and calling oneself European is very different from actually being European  especially in times of stress  there won t be many  Europeans  watching the Euro 2012 football   so the first option is an almost impossible ask The alternative is to go back to square one with multiple revalued   devalued currencies and with the EU reverting to being a trading bloc  This has more serious implications for Germany  simply as a result of the law of large numbers  than it does for Greece for example  However with Spain on the verge of a  40  100 billion back hander it s a bit late in the day to be arguing about the practicalities  The German constitutional court may well have a problem with an unconstrained bale out  but recent history shows that driving a coach and horses through a constitution and then  making up  legislation to make it  whole  some way down the road  and often beyond the pile of cans put there whilst you made your mind up  becomes a political  necessity  This then is the  third way  and it will be sold to a gullible public on the grounds that it is  in your best interests    what else could we do   The ECB will print  the German constitutional court will be sidelined the Spanish banks will get their money and for a brief  oh so brief  moment the crisis will be over  The ticking clock will then be reset as the centre of the hurricane moves from Madrid to Rome In the midst of this rudderless vacuum can anyone please tell me what is the point of having a Herman van Rompuy  Answers on a postcard please  The winner will receive a signed photo of Nigel Farage  The judge s decision will be final unless over ruled by the German constitutional court and or a clause in the NDAA  National Defense Authorisation Act aka the repeal of habeas corpus in the US  we have all missed or I have to post the photo as collateral with the ECB to qualify for a loan to pay the gas bill ,2012-06-10,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/answers-on-a-postcard…june-9th-2012-126009,126009
180845,402361,TPR,Week Of Hope And Helium,opinion,Pardon me for referring my older posts to bring home the points because mostly we read selectively and remember what confirms our belief  This is called  Confirmation Bias   Thursday I wrote   Is the rally over  Somehow I do not think so  I think it still has few more days of fuel left and we may see the uptrend resumed tomorrow    So we have on Friday  I wish all my calls would be always so correct But the overnight action was not very convincing and in the morning I decided that I will not hold positions over the weekend  In a headline driven market  where the market acts in a schizophrenic manner  it is too risky to leave open positions in a counter trend rally  In any case the bounce has been weak so far  I expected 1340 would be taken out by now but we are still struggling to get past the high of May 29th  So in the morning I sent out tweets that I plan to exit all positions during the day on a bounce  It is better to take profit when you just had a 500 point pop in DOW over hope and helium  I still have GLD which I will hold for now So now we are in cash and cushy  No tension going over the weekend and worrying whether Spain will be able to save its crappy banks and kick the can down for few more months  If Spain does ask for bailout  it may either start a new wave of selling or start a relief rally  I do not know and I do not want to take any chances  If you have noticed carefully  today the big boyz were totally absent and the volume was almost half of normal  No wonder we had a melt up in the afternoon  But unless Uncle Ben shows up with the money bag  I have no intention of going long  I may play between support and resistance in a very small scale  but that is not investing  That is gambling and you have to be very clear that you are risking your capital in the hope of finding space between elephant s toes  And I do not recommend it to regular folks looking for safe investing  Now is not the time yet So what s next going forward  I am conflicted whether we will follow plan  A  which is to follow the script of last year or plan  B  which is to follow the Presidential election year cycle  It is quite possible that we have seen the bottom on June 4th  But it is also possible that more selling is to come given all the uncertainty  More the reason to be careful and not commit to any particular position  As I have said before  I am sure we will have a test of the lows but I am not sure of lower lows  If that is the case  then I have a nice Elliott Wave chart to share with you It has been made by Jamie Seattele  who is a currency technical analyst by profession and does this for living  I respect Jamie s work and I thought it is worth sharing with the readers  But it does not mean I agree with him  It s just another possibility If 1267 was the low for SPX then this plan plays out  But we do not know  Either way  the point A in the chart coincides with my call for bounce and we are almost done there  May be little bit more on the upside on Monday  Why do I think we will have some more bounce on Monday  Mainly because of the price action of Euro From this hourly chart of Euro you can see that Euro broke the trend line and is now re testing the lower part of the line  In all likelihood  it will go up to test 1 2550 1 2600 level and fall back  That can happen on Monday  When that happens  it will be a good place to short  Another potential short candidate is Crude if it reaches   88 and fails there  In the afternoon  while SPX and Nasdaq flat lined  Crude started going up and I hope it goes up a whole lot more But McClellan Oscillator is at a level from where market cannot go up much higher and the logical route is down So now we wait for the correction and see where it ends  That will give us an idea which plan we are going to follow  There is no rush and we are not going to miss anything worthwhile by being careful  End of the day  hopefully you are going to thank me for my relentless call for safety and cash  When we are playing with our future and retirement funds  it pays to have a cautious coach ,2012-06-10,BB Finance Blog,https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-of-hope-and-helium-126012,126012
180846,402362,TPR,Massive Short Squeeze Doesn t Change Anything ,opinion,Welcome to the third quarter of a genuinely nutty trading year    The second quarter went out with a bang as the S P 500 tacked on 2 5  in Friday s session  and the Nasdaq Composite rallied a full three percentage points    Given the poor economic picture and the bearish sentiment on the street  it s easy to see how this was the perfect opportunity to roll out a massive short squeeze    Leading up to the end of the quarter  bearish traders were gaining confidence  as a trifecta of major macro issues converged  In Europe  the debt crisis appeared to be approaching a climactic showdown Traders are reacting to growing expectations for a hard landing in China In the US  the economic picture is tilting towards a grinding recessionary environment With a significant amount of pessimistic sentiment  and the technical picture looking very negative  traders were gravitating to the bearish side of the ledger  German rhetoric was becoming more hard nosed against shouldering the debt burden   leading to a major showdown for Europe    So when Merkel flipped scripts and offered concessions  traders were caught off guard and leaning too far in the wrong direction    It didn t help matters that this was the last day of the quarter   a prime window dressing session  Seizing the opportunity  institutional long only investors were able to add pressure  forcing more shorts to cover and driving up prices to be marked to market for the quarterly reports    So as we head into the second half of the year  we find ourselves at a very interesting juncture  Short term  the buying pressure is strong and it would not be abnormal for a major short squeeze to last for several trading sessions  With a holiday shortened week in the US  lower liquidity could exacerbate the action and allow for a larger price movement    But fundamentally  there still isn t much to get excited about  Europe STILL has a major debt crisis and there is no easy solution  Even Germany s concessions are not going to be enough to turn the tide  China is still a great candidate for a hard landing  and the US is still on course to re enter a recessionary environment    We re keeping most of our powder dry  but licking our chops at some of the short opportunities that are setting up  If the rally fizzles and fear comes back into the market again  the reset caused by Friday s massive push higher could give us some great entry prices   along with plenty of room for bearish trends to run    Below are a few of the bullish and bearish areas we are focusing on for the first week in this new quarter Energy Extended   More Short Term Opportunities   As the global economic picture has worsened  energy has been one of the areas that has been hit the hardest    Oil prices have spent the entire second quarter under pressure  with the iPath Goldman Sachs Crude ETN  OIL  remaining below its 20 EMA since the beginning of May  That s a long time for a major commodity to remain under consistent  almost daily selling pressure    But as we neared the end of the quarter  crude found buyers at a major support level dating back to the second half of 2010  Given the bearish sentiment and the short term extended price action  the energy complex offered a great reward to risk opportunity  from the long side     Last week we ended up taking short term bullish trades on both Penn Virginia  PVA  and Swift Energy  SFY   The snap back action allowed us to capture quick profits    With natural gas improving significantly over the second quarter  and crude oil bouncing off long term support  we could continue to see strong bullish opportunities in energy producers as well as transmission  storage  and refining stocks    Financials For a Bounce    The financial sector represents another short term bullish area that we are active in    As traders react to the prospects of a temporary European resolution  key word being temporary   sentiment levels for banks could be in for a dramatic shift    PE ratios for regional and national banks are at levels that reflect a significant amount of uncertainty for the industry  But meanwhile  bank profits have continued to hold up well  and most bank stocks are paying attractive dividends    There is still too much balance sheet  and off balance sheet  risk for these stocks to once again be considered  widow   orphan  safety investments  But a decent yield and relative value  along with a shift in the Europe perspective  should be enough to keep bank stocks in an uptrend at least for the next few weeks    On Friday  we took a long position in both Wells Fargo  WFC  as well as U S  Bancorp  USB   Both WFC and USB gapped through our stop   limit buy orders but pulled back during the session to hit our limit prices before trading higher to close out the quarter    As long as the major banks avoid an ugly earnings season  and barring any immediate reversal of fortune in Europe  banking stocks should continue to melt higher  We re not expecting a major long term trend to hold up  but given the attractive yield and sentiment shift  we should be able to capture a number of profitable trades  High Profile Retail Stocks Still Weak   On the retail side  there are a number of popular growth stocks that are tracing out major topping patterns    Many of these names have held up well as the higher end US consumer has continued to spend  But as the economy grinds back towards a recessionary environment  these stocks are now coming under pressure    Panera Bread  PNRA   Coach Inc   COH  and Lululemon Athletica  LULU  are all good examples of formerly strong growth stocks that are now breaking down    We have been short COH for more than a month now  with half profits already taken off the table and a trend position continuing to run for the second half    The luxury handbag maker sliced through a key support level last week before rebounding Friday in line with the rest of the market  With partial profits already taken off the table  and 14  unrealized profits on the second half  we have the ability to give this trending position some elbow room  while still guaranteeing an even larger profit on the second half if we are stopped out    LULU looks particularly interesting after breaking sharply below the 200 EMA last week  and then staging a half hearted rally on Friday  If the stock can hold up for another session or two  we should have a good opportunity to enter with a relatively tight risk envelope and plenty of room for the stock to drop  Heading towards the open  S P futures are pointing to a flat start to the second quarter  Trading desks will likely be manned by second string professionals this week as record heat and a holiday week gives most traders an excuse to hit the Hamptons early    We re keeping our exposure light as well  and watching to see if the market s new strength has legs  or simply sets up better entries for our short candidates    Trade  em well this week  Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice ,2012-07-03,Mercenary

Coach s Hong Kong Depositary Receipts are traded on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited under the symbol 6388  Earnings Determine Market Price The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends And Normal PE Since 2008 Performance Table The associated performance results with the Earnings and Price Correlated Graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 14 4  capital appreciation  long term shareholders of Coach Inc  assuming an initial investment of  100 000  would have received an additional   6 867 00 in dividends that increased their total return from 14 4  to 15 3  per annum The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 2008 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Coach Inc is 3 50  which is historically high  Looking To The Future Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 31 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Coach Inc s long term earnings growth at 15 1   Coach Inc has low long term debt at 1  of capital  Coach Inc is currently trading at a P E of 15 9  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 19 6  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Coach Inc s True Worth  valuation would be  126 59 at the end of 2017  which would be a 16 1  annual rate of return from the current price Earnings Yield Estimates Discounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Coach Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Coach Inc s expected earnings would be 8 7 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although  with just a quick glance you can know a lot

180874,402390,TPR,U S  Trading Outlook  Faltering Chinese Growth  The Luxury Retail Slump,opinion,In the US  Memorial Day weekend serves as the unofficial beginning of summer   which typically means lower trading volume  and sleepy action  This is the week when Wall Street portfolio managers start to escape the city and head for the Hamptons  and retail investors focus on travel plans rather than trend lines    But this year  the summer investment environment is a bit different  While US traders used Monday as a chance to take in a ball game or fire up the barbecue  traders in Europe continued to handicap the debt crisis with Spain now challenging Greece for the most sensational headlines    On Friday  S P downgraded 5 Spanish banks  as losses from the country s property bust continue to mount  While Prime Minister Rajoy continues to claim that the country will NOT need a bailout  Spain has been urging the ECB to lower borrowing costs so they can roll debt obligations and still manage to keep up with interest payments    To be sure  the European debt crisis isn t new news  It seems that the continent has been in the slow train wreck process for years now   and there is still plenty of motivation to continue to prop up failing banks  and countries  in order to avert the inevitable crisis    But the problem is that investors are losing faith when it comes to the  crisis averted  statements   and with a more skeptical global investor base  comes the risk of massive capital withdrawals  from both deposit institutions as well as global equity markets    So heading into the new trading week  there s certainly a possibility for the traditional slow sleepy trading environment  but we also see plenty of opportunities for sharp price dislocations and significant trading action  It just depends on how the chess pieces in Europe are played   along with traders  responses to the political maneuvering    Looking at the recent action in US equities  it s pretty easy to make a bearish case for stocks  All four of the major indices  Dow Jones Industrial Average  S P 500  Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000  have broken below key support levels and then consolidated or drifted higher  Considering the bearish patterns for the major market indices  its no surprise that there is a large number of bearish trade setups in the queue  Below are a few of the areas we are particularly interested in for the coming week    Luxury Retail Sentiment Drops   Luxury retail stocks are taking it on the chin as investors adjust to slower growth expectations   The group weathered a challenging domestic economic environment relatively well as US and European consumers reined in spending   But now that emerging markets are also reporting decelerating economic growth  the group s prospects are becoming much less attractive    In last week s trading outlook post  we made a bearish case for the retail apparel group as a number of key constituents offered disappointing outlooks   Luxury retailers are following the same pattern with stocks breaking down as executives outline a distressed environment for selling to high net worth shoppers    Consider this  from  regarding Tiffany   Co   TIF  s revised earnings outlook    Tiffany also said spending by financial sector employees has continued to slow while  substantial competitive discounting  remains a problem    Meanwhile  shoppers balked at entry level silver jewelry after Tiffany raised prices to offset the rising cost of materials  from precious metals to diamonds    While visitors from abroad still drove sales in the Americas  Tiffany said it saw a drop in sales  especially to European tourists  at its New York store    In China  sales have slowed  echoing remarks made by such European counterparts as Burberry and LVMH  Still  Tiffany said its store growth plan there remains on track    A worldwide slowdown in luxury spending could set up some tremendous trading opportunities  This month s 21  decline in Sotheby s  BID  along with Tiffany s ominous warning has set up some sharp breakdowns that are now giving way to consolidation or drift patterns    We have a pending short trade set up for Coach Inc   COH  as the stock has completed a rounding top pattern and is now poised to continue the bearish action with any help from the overall market environment  Facebook Faceplant Creates Social Media Opportunity   It s hard to overstate the importance of the Facebook Inc   FB  IPO just over a week ago    Not only did the transaction mark the culmination of literally years of hype  the deal was also completely botched by both Morgan Stanley  MS    downgrading the stock ahead of the offering   and Nasdaq OMX  NDAQ    screwing up executions on the most highly anticipated IPO in years    The fun is just getting started    The actual IPO transaction had the unintended consequence of   and then when the IPO started trading lower it created a cascade effect across the entire social media group    This week  we re keeping a close eye on social media candidates as the initial breakdown which coincided with the Facebook transaction should lead to a continuation pattern and further bearish action    Homeaway Inc   AWAY  looks particularly vulnerable as the stock has tried repeatedly to break above its  27 IPO price  but has met significant resistance  A fresh breakdown in conjunction with more weakness from the group could be the first step for a much more significant drop    And considering the premium multiple investors are currently paying for the stock  there is plenty of room for lower prices before value investors would start getting interested in supporting the stock  Gaming Rests Hope on Faltering China   For the gaming industry  Las Vegas is just another city    The true growth for casino operators comes from China s Macau province  where gambling is legalized and throngs of affluent Chinese visit for both the gaming and atmosphere  shops and restaurants    Problem is  with the Chinese growth engine decelerating  investors are starting to worry about the growth expectations for the gaming industry in Macau    Of course the industry isn t going to evaporate or turn unprofitable overnight  In fact  we expect profitability to continue to grow over the next few years   but at a slower rate than investors have become accustomed to    But as China s economy approaches stall speed  and economists debate whether the country will experience a soft or hard landing  Chinese consumers are likely to pull back on how much they travel  on their level of luxury spending  and even on how much they wager at the baccarat tables    Gaming stocks have already completed major topping patterns with capital flowing out of stocks like Wynn Resorts  WYNN  and MGM Resorts International  MGM     Las Vegas Sands  LVS  has completely reversed its first quarter breakout  and has spent the last week etching out a narrow wedge pattern  A break lower would confirm the bearish trend   in a sector that has already established a bearish pattern  While US equity markets were closed on Monday  Globex futures markets were relatively active with the S P contracts advancing marginally and precious metals inching slightly higher Modestly bullish action would not be a surprise  given the light amount of economic data and the absence of catastrophic news out of Europe  We re keeping our risk points relatively tight in case we get another euphoric  all clear  signal out of Europe  But the majority of our pending setups are on the bearish side of the ledger as we continue to respect the price action and the risks associated with the darkening macro picture Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice

180894,402410,TPR,What I Learned From a Well Known Stock up 3 212 ,opinion,During the early 1970s  an Oregon track coach by the name of Bill Bowerman changed the world in his kitchen  Trying to develop a new running shoe that would help his athlete s grip the surface of the track  Bowerman poured liquid urethane onto his wife s waffle iron  The result was a revolutionary running outsole that  when used in conjunction with a lightweight running shoe  allowed his athlete s to run on Oregon s new urethane track much more effectively Bowerman s design proved to be a game changer  It wasn t long before most collegiate track programs were utilizing Bowerman s new shoe  The  Waffle Trainer   as the shoe eventually came to be known as  became the prototype for the first product of his new company  Nike Inc   NYSE     Since Bowerman took his shoe    and his company    public  he and his early investors have enjoyed overwhelming success    All told  Nike is up 3 212  since it made its debut on Dec  2  1980  Nike s success reflects one of the most important things I ve come to learn as an investor    game changing companies aren t limited to high tech sectors  See  as the chief investment strategist behind   most people think the stocks I recommend will be involved in computing  e commerce  biotech or some other  hot  industry where the changes are obvious But  as Nike s success proves  that is an extremely limited view of what a game changer is  and where one might reasonably look to find one  The fact of the matter is  A game changer is any company  technology  business model or set of external circumstances that alter the baseline assumptions about doing business within an industry In other words  game changers can happen anywhere  anytime Consider another example  shipping  for instance  The shipping industry has been around as long as humankind has been able to navigate the open sea But it was relatively recently  beginning in the 1950s and evolving through the 1970s  that cargo began to be loaded into standard sized containers But this took off wholesale in 1995 with the abolition of the Interstate Commerce Commission  which allows containers to be fully integrated into the nationwide U S  transportation system  which theretofore had been a hodge podge of state and local regulations left over from the railroad era This was a game changer  The industry remade itself in very short order  and now 90  of the world s cargo is moved this way  Shipping was an  old  business  but it was dramatically changed  And there were fortunes made by investors in the process Of course  a couple of historical assessments is hardly a complete list  but it underscores the point that game changers need not to be limited to  high tech  sectors like computing and bio tech In the next couple of years we could see new game changing movements in many other  old    staid  or  boring  sectors  We will see them in Agriculture  We ll see them in precious metals  which is just as old as agriculture and shipping  We ll see game changers in rail  We ll see them in manufacturing and in logistics  in communication and even in food  Action to Take     In other words  the  next big thing  doesn t have to be a miracle drug or a new smartphone  It could be as simple as a new shoe design  or a major change in an industry as old as man kind itself ,2012-03-21,StreetAuthority,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-i-learned-from-a-well-known-stock-up-3,212-117716",117716

180925,402441,TPR,Fastenal  FAST   A Vivid Case of Overvaluation,opinion,Our normal policy is to produce articles and analysis on companies that we believe offer attractive valuations based on earnings and cash flows   However  we ve recently received numerous requests to write about companies that may be overvalued by Mr  Market  This article is going to cover a company that we have owned in the past  and very much admire for its long consistent record of operating excellence as reflected by its consistent record of earnings and dividend growth  This superb business is Fastenal Company  FAST   and we believe it is an extraordinary business that the market is currently overpricing  Fastenal  FAST  is a leading retailer and wholesaler of industrial and construction supplies   The company operates approximately 2500 stores located in the United States  Puerto Rico  Canada  Mexico  Singapore  China  the Netherlands  United Kingdom  Hungary and Malaysia   The company s primary product lines range from fasteners  tools  hydraulics and pneumatics  to janitorial supplies  batteries  sealants and much more  Fastenal Company  A Legacy of Operating Excellence Fastenal Company  FAST  has a long history of increasing their earnings at a high and consistent rate   The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  reviews their operating history from calendar year 1994 to the end year 2008  Our purpose for stopping the graph at calendar year 2008 was to illustrate three important facts   First  we wanted to show how they have increased earnings per year at a compounded rate of almost 24  per annum up to the great recession of 2008  Second  we wanted to graphically illustrate how the long term trend line movement of the stock price has closely correlated to and tracked earnings growth   Finally  we wanted to illustrate how the market has often priced their shares at a premium to earnings growth  Therefore  to summarize the following graphic  From 1994 to 2008 the Fastenal Company grew earnings from   6 a share in 1994 to   95 a share by 2008  resulting in a 23 7  compound annual growth rate   The normal PE line depicts a trimmed  the highest PE and the lowest PE trimmed  average PE ratio of 36 3  this simply indicates that the market has often priced this company at a peg ratio in excess of one   On the other hand  it is clear from the picture that the stock price often moved above and below the normal PE  and in many cases traded at its orange earnings justified valuation line Our next earnings and price correlated graph covers the 15 year period 1998 to current time There are a couple of important points that should be emphasized here Notice how the 35  drop in earnings for calendar year 2009 impacted Fastenal Company s compounded earnings growth rate   This one year drop in earnings reduced its average annual growth rate from 23 7  to 17 4    However  also notice how earnings growth since calendar year 2009 has actually exceeded the long term average of 23 7   averaging 33 9   Also  notice that the normal PE ratio now calculates to 32 4 instead of 36 3   It s important that the reader understands that these measurements simply represent barometers rather than absolute values To reiterate  since calendar year 2010  Fastenal Company has grown earnings at the average rate of 33 9  per annum  This accelerated earnings growth should be considered as coming off of the low base which was created by the recession of 2008 Furthermore  we believe this accelerated earnings growth greatly attributes to the company s current abnormally high PE ratio of 37 8   In other words  the market is valuing this company very optimistically  When you review the performance associated with the above earnings and price correlating graph we discover an almost perfect correlation between Fastenal s earnings growth rate of 17 4  and the capital appreciation it generated for shareholders of 17 6   Also  notice that the company is a Dividend Contender that has increased its dividend every year for 13 consecutive years  note that the dividend cut reflected in the table for 2009 is due to a special one time extra dividend that was paid in 2008  Fastenal Company   A Clear Picture of OvervaluationThe following estimated earnings and return calculator is drawn based on the consensus of 10 analysts reporting to Capital IQ   The consensus of these leading analysts forecast earnings growth over the next five years at 19    The Value Line Investment Survey forecasts approximately 15 5  earnings growth  and the consensus of nine analysts reporting to Zacks expect five year earnings growth of 18 1     The point is that all of these various estimates are more or less in alignment  with only modest and reasonable deviations from each other   Therefore  we re comfortable in stating that a 15  to 20  growth rate on this extremely high quality company with its great track record seems reasonable  all things considered Therefore  assuming that the estimates from the various analysts are within reason correct  then we would argue that this high quality company  with no debt on its balance sheet  and a great record of earnings growth  is nevertheless very expensive today   We believe this is also apparent in the context of the fact that there are numerous other companies with similar operating histories  and dividend yields that are trading at PE ratios one half to one third of what is currently being awarded to Fastenal Company We beieve that we would all agree that if you took one dollar s worth of Fastenal s dividend to a store to buy something  and one dollar s worth of dividends from another company with a similar growth rate  the store proprietor would not give you more change on Fastenal s  dollar  than they would the other company s  In other words  one dollar s worth of earnings of one company is worth no more or no less than one dollar s worth of earnings of another Since this is true  how do you explain the fact that the market will value Fastenal s one dollar s worth of earnings today at  38  and for example  only value a dollar s worth of earnings from the luxury retailer Coach  COH  at only  21 a share  This is especially befuddling when you consider that Coach s historical earnings growth rate of 33  per annum is almost twice as high as Fastenal Company s To put a final perspective on why we believe that Fastenal is overvalued  is to calculate the earnings yield that the current valuation reflects   The following earnings yield estimator shows that at today s valuation  Fastenal only offers prospective investors an earnings yield of 3 2    Additionally  the dividend yield of 1 5  is less than what can be earned on the riskless 10 year Treasury bond  This seems like an awful low return from earnings and dividends for the amount of risk that the prospective investor is being asked to assume ConclusionWe believe that the Fastenal Company is an extremely high quality stock with a very bright future  Nevertheless  we feel that the current valuation the market is placing on their shares is not only higher than their fundamentals justify  but also seem excessive in light of the valuations that the market is generally applying to other businesses  Consequently  we believe that shareholders would be prudent to either sell their shares or at least take some of their profits off the table  The stock has had a great run over the last three years but valuation now appears to be excessive  The great investor Warren Buffett once advised us

180926,402442,TPR,Keynesians Jump the Gun on Inflation,opinion,Advocates of government stimulus are running victory laps on recent developments that appear to vindicate their strategy  In particular  Paul Krugman compares the sluggish growth in Europe to the somewhat less sluggish growth in the US to prove that stimulus was more effective than austerity  Other economists are using government inflation measures to defend Fed Chairman Bernanke s easy money policy  The only problem is  they re calling the race before the finish line is even in sight As usual  Paul Krugman overlooks basic economics  which  despite his Nobel Prize  is a science about which Mr  Krugman really knows very little   The reason stimulus is so politically popular is that it appears to work in the short term  However  appearances can often be deceiving  as they are right now in the US  Stimulus merely numbs the pain of economic contraction  as the underlying trauma gets worse  Austerity might slow an economy down  but at least the wounds are able to heal  America has chosen the former and Europe the latter  albeit not quite as large a dose as needed  The fact that in the short run Europe is suffering more than the US does not vindicate Washington s approach  On the contrary  this is exactly what is to be expected What we re seeing is like a race where each runner has a broken ankle  One has a coach who tells him to pace himself and not worry so much about winning this one  while the other coach gives his runner a shot of painkillers and tells him to give it all he s got  Of course  early in the race  the doped up runner is going to be flying down the track like nothing s wrong  while the other runner might be limping at half his normal speed  However  when the drugs wear off  the sprinter is liable to collapse from pain  leaving the better coached runner to limp across the finish line  The true test is not the immediate effects of stimulus or austerity  but the long term results  For that reason  Krugman s conclusions are meaningless  The apparent success of stimulus simply results from spending more borrowed money on government programs and consumption  But don t we all agree now that this is exactly what caused the financial crisis in the first place As far as inflation is concerned  a vindication of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is equally premature  First of all  it s not that Quantitative Easing will lead to inflation  it s that QE is inflation  Secondly  there is a lag between QE and rising consumer prices  so the jury is still out as to how high consumer prices will ultimately rise as a result of current and past Fed policy mistakes But even more fundamentally  it is absurd to look solely at government price measures  which are built to understate inflation  and conclude that QE has not already produced an elevated cost of living  For example  the 2 4  rise in the Personal Consumption Expenditure  PCE  Index in 2011 is more of an indictment of the accuracy of the index than a vindication of Bernanke  In fact  of all the ways the government purports to measure inflation  the PCE is perhaps the most meaningless  as it relies on built in mechanisms like goods substitution to hide a lower standard of living  As an example of how this works  imagine you are used to eating farm fresh butter but have to switch to cheaper but also less healthy margarine from a factory  the PCE would say you are no worse off  That s exactly why the Fed chooses to use this uncommon metric Mark Gertler  an economics professor at New York University  argues that even the Consumer Price Index  which rose at a more vigorous 3 2  in 2011  proves Bernanke s critics wrong  According to Gertler  the CPI has risen at an average annual rate of 2 4  thus far under Bernanke s tenure  significantly less than the 3 1  average under Alan Greenspan  and the 6 3  under Paul Volcker   However  Gertler overlooks two key points  First  the methodology used to calculate the CPI was much different during the Volcker era  If we still calculated the CPI the way we did then  the numbers would be much higher for both Greenspan and Bernanke  Second  given the huge economic contraction that has taken place under Bernanke  consumer prices should have fallen   significantly  The fact that they rose anyway indicates tremendous inflation Of course  the Fed s ability to stimulate the economy with inflation only works as long as bondholders remain ignorant of its plan  For now  the seemingly hopeful news reports are giving the Fed cover to keep stimulating  As long as the market remains convinced there is no inflation  the Fed can continue to create it  However  once the effects are so pronounced that even the PCE can no longer hide them  the Fed will be in a real bind Think of our two runners again  Even after the race is over  the fellow who chose to dope up likely injured himself even further  He might have even ended his career  So  the early dash and the cheer of the crowd in that one race was clearly not worth the many years of misery he would incur in the future Regardless of what the triumphant Keynesians would have you believe  my analysis continues to be that the current combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus is driving us toward disaster  Instead of a real recovery  the US will experience an inflationary depression  Europe  on the other hand  will suffer much less  precisely because it was not seduced by the short term appeal of stimulus ,2012-02-14,Euro

180951,402467,TPR,Markets Inspired By Fed s QE3,opinion,Last week not only did Europe deliver a ray of hope  but  more importantly  the Federal Reserve indicated a willingness to resume its money printing exercise  Thus  the greenback entered a short term negative trend and equities celebrated But first I would like to point out a few unscientific economic observations  Wasn t Microsoft s  MSFT  Bill Gates that once said   and I m paraphrasing    that he liked flying coach because that s where his customers were  Well  sometimes with economics the best approach is to take a step back  throw all the literature and data into a box  and pay attention to the subtle messages around us  One can learn a lot by walking the pavement and getting a feel for what the common person and business is saying and doing What I have noticed at supermarkets is that the basic goods have risen in price  and  as an example  bread is one of them  while wheat futures dropped 30  since February  In addition  a constant flow of specials and discounts highlights how difficult it is to sell the less basic items  The pricing power only exists where the customer doesn t have a choice  and speaks volumes about the underlying economic strength Credit card commercials are now focused on all sorts of bonus programs  and increasingly offering cash back    a feature that was unique to the Discover card    seeking that elusive spender that has become a rare commodity  Lastly  the  layaway  comeback highlights the aversion to debt  or the inability to obtain credit  and is yet another old tactic to entice the consumer into the stores  Economically speaking  weakness is everywhere  and last week was replete with speeches delivered by several Federal Reserve members  I ll start with Sandra Pianalto  the President of the Cleveland Fed  as reported by MarketWatch      My outlook for real GDP growth in 2012 is about 2 5   on par with the past two years   Pianalto said in a speech at the University of Toledo  The primary cause of the stubbornly high unemployment rate is that spending by consumers  businesses and government remains  uninspiring   Pianalto said I think she s very optimistic  but the surprising portion of the statement is the bundling of government with the other two types  and if she feels that government spending is  uninspiring   maybe she should take a guided tour of the Treasury department s balance sheet Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota also offered his opinion  according to Reuters  although there s no reliable way to determine the validity of his claim     U S  unemployment is  disturbingly high   but it would be even higher had the Federal Reserve not undertaken a series of unprecedented steps to ease monetary policy  a top Fed official said on Thursday Then the talk about more Fed stimulus started to pick up steam  and Federal Reserve Board Gov  Daniel Tarullo gave us a glimpse when he said that another  large scale purchase program of agency backed  mortgage backed securities to support the economy  would be considered  as reported by MarketWatch  which the stock market liked a lot     In a speech at Columbia University in New York  Tarullo said that the purchases could help the housing market  which is  central to the slow pace of the recovery  Without a doubt  the two central themes were housing and unemployment  and the former continues to hinder the economic engine from moving forward Janet Yellen  The Federal Reserve s Vice Chair  also opined and stated that  we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability   as reported by Reuters  But price stability in this context was not  inflation   the preferred Fed topic     She said bond markets were again hinting at a rising risk of deflation    the threat that prompted the Fed s second round of bond buys last year Finally  and as reported by MarketWatch  further easing is being considered   and the stock market liked it a lot     The Federal Reserve will try to give greater guidance to markets about its low interest rate policy at its November meeting while keeping more quantitative easing in its back pocket for use if the economy starts to weaken  analysts said Friday after a wave of central bank speeches this week And that was the story for last week  and although the stock market found a new path North and defied the hard core  yet correct calls for a weak economy  the economic landscape will not change an iota  But as I ve stated before  stock markets and economics don t mix  and move at different speeds  while flexibility and an open mind will go a long way toward achieving investment success Even if one sees the Fed speeches as a deliberate  put   swimming against the current is detrimental to one s financial health ,2011-10-25,Carlos X.
