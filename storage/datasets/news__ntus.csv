22372,243887,NTUS,Zacks com Highlights  Natus Medical  GoPro  Enviva Partners And Bruker,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 15  2017   Stocks in this week s article include  Natus Medical Inc   NASDAQ BABY    GoPro Inc   NASDAQ GPRO    Enviva Partners LP   NYSE EVA   and Bruker Corporation   NASDAQ BRKR   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Top Stocks with Earnings Acceleration to Buy NowEarnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time  Constant earnings growth interests almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is because upbeat earnings serve as a indicator of a company s profitability  It also more often than not leads to an uptick in the share price Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a rally in the stock price Finding Future OutperformersIn case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Basically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week

22374,243889,NTUS,4 Growth Stocks To Pick From A Choppy MedTech Market,opinion,The U S  investment space has been fraught with uncertainties of late  The healthcare industry  in particular  has been facing multiple issues  with the Obamacare repeal saga dominating the headlines  However  President Trump s proposed policies to abolish the infamous 2 3  medical device sales tax  a key part of the Affordable Care Act  have kindled hope in the MedTech space  Notably  this tax has been suspended for two years and is supposed to be put into effect again on Jan 1  2018 Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees  limit research and development activities and reduce capital investment  However  a recently proposed legislation looks to extend the suspension of the medical device tax for another five years  This has undoubtedly been the latest buzz in the MedTech space How Will the Tax Suspension Help MedTech  The tax code is a monstrosity and there s only one thing to do with it  Scrap it  kill it  drive a stake through its heart  bury it and hope it never rises again to terrorize the American people     Steve ForbesAdvaMed  a leading American medical device trade association  had referred to the medical device tax as a  significant drag on medical innovation   Small device companies have suffered the most owing to this  Amid such worries  a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost the pace of hiring and investment among the 9 000 America based medical device manufacturers  instilling investor confidence in the stocks In line with the latest legislation  a report by The Joint Committee on Taxation as published in Forbes in the article written by Bruce Japsen suggests that the Internal Revenue Service collected taxes in the range of  1 billion to  2 billion per year in 2013  2014 and 2015  This repealing of the medical device tax will cost the U S  Treasury around  20 billion over a decade AdvaMed s CEO Scott Whitaker said that during 2016 and 2017  MedTech players have been able to reinvest a huge amount in innovation that would otherwise have been paid as taxes Further  according to a report by Joe Panetta  Biocom s president and CEO  the Congress must repeal the tax immediately which impedes innovation  jobs  economic growth and delays patient access to medical technology  This is also necessary to ensure that MedTech sectors continue with research and development and reinvest in innovation How is MedTech Positioned Though Medtech is faced with intense volatility  there are bountiful opportunities in the space  Per Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board  U S  health care spending is estimated to reach approximately  5 5 trillion by 2025  representing 19 9  of Gross Domestic Product  based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025  In the view of this  investors should ideally pick stocks that have the potential to safeguard portfolios from market volatility Our Screening ParametersIn order to save investors the time taking process of identifying the best performing MedTech stocks  we have taken the help of the  We also

year old company just IPO d in May  But we kept doing our homework here and we were not scared away when shares dipped under  29  Indeed  that was our cue to add more extreme value last week  end of Dec 21 TAZR commentary The Little  Ole Success Story You Never Heard OfEven though they ve been in business for 30 years  SMART just IPO d in May of 2017 at  12  And given its growth trajectory  that

disorders and diseases for public health laboratories If you ve ever known a family who spent time in the neonatal intensive care unit  NICU  of a hospital  chances are they were exposed to these types of products  I have seen first hand how a cooling blanket works to prevent potential brain bleeding and swelling after a baby in our family was put on one for the first 72 hours of her life because of a difficult birth where the physicians were concerned she may have been without oxygen for several minutes It is truly amazing that medical research has found a way to lower a newborn s body temperature into a state of hypothermia to prevent brain damage  and to do this procedure safely Lack of oxygen to the brain in newborns is called neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy  HIE  and occurs in approximately 5 out of every 1 000 births  Without immediate treatment  infants are at risk not only of severe brain damage  but death as well  The National InstituteS of Health estimate that 15 20  of newborns who develop HIE will die So Why Did BABY Shares Drop 20  Last Week On January 8  Natus announced preliminary Q4 results and gave guidance for the coming year  Both sets of numbers disappointed investors and analysts  with 2017 revenues expected to fall in a range of  500 5 million to  501 5 million  versus the Street consensus of approximately  515 5 million Here was President and CEO Jim Hawkins commenting on how management expected the company to finish up the year    Revenue in the fourth quarter was lower than expected due to weakness in our U S  Neurodiagnostic business  In addition  due in part to disruption from the integration of computer systems  fourth quarter revenue was also lower than expected at Otometrics  Revenue from our recently acquired neurosurgery business was slightly above our expectations  Newborn Care revenue performed as expected  For the full year 2018  Natus expects to report revenue of  535 to  540 million and non GAAP EPS of  1 60 to  1 65  For the first quarter of 2018  management expects to report revenue of  125 to  127 million and non GAAP EPS of  0 23 to  0 24  The first quarter and full year of 2017 included approximately  10 million in revenue from a non recurring contract with Venezuela that is not expected to reoccur in 2018 The Zacks consensus numbers prior to this announcement were Q1 EPS of  0 38 on revenue of  129 7 million and 2018 EPS of  2 11 on revenue of  557 1 million Additional Content 3 Stocks Likely to Beat Earnings This WeekEarnings season is finally heating up  and this week

Edwards Lifesciences continued with its trend of delivering better than expected operating results in the first half of 2016  This is evident from the strong second quarter results that the company reported late last month  which squarely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Geographically Edwards Lifesciences excelled in both the U S  as well as overseas  particularly in its transcatheter heart valve  THV  product segment  While in the domestic front  this segment s growth was widespread  in the international market consistent therapy adoption was witnessed in Europe along with strong contributions from Japan 
Among the emerging nations  the company made notable progress in Japan and has recently launched its tricuspid surgical valve repair product in this country  Since then  the company has been observing strong demand for this therapy  We believe this in turn will allow Edwards to constantly deliver a solid heart valve performance in the emerging market of Japan 
With respect to pipeline development  post acquisition of CardiAQ Valve Technologies  in the early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform  Edwards is currently in the process of implementing several enhancements  including new delivery systems and utilizing Edwards  advanced tissue technology  Management plans to incorporate these improvements as part of its CE Mark trial called Relief  which will investigate both Edwards and CardiAQ s mitral valves 
Management expects to begin treating patients under this trial soon  Early U S  feasibility studies with both of these technologies are currently underway We are also encouraged to note the upward revision in the company s 2016 guidance 
On the flip side  unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations continue to affect Edwards Lifesciences  operations  Evidently foreign exchange headwinds impacted Edwards Lifesciences  gross margin by 100 basis points in the second quarter 
Although Edwards Lifesciences has signed foreign exchange hedging contracts to partially mitigate the adverse impact of currency exchange  management continued to witness reduced benefits from these contracts  which in turn affects the gross margin figure  Additionally competitive headwinds and reduced reimbursement also continue to pose threats to this stock

22691,244206,NTUS,GNC Holdings  GNC  Tops Q2 Earnings  Suspends  16 View,opinion,"GNC Holdings Inc    NYSE GNC   reported second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 79 cents  reflecting a year over year improvement of 2 6  owing to a more than 20  drop in the company s weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
The quarter s adjusted EPS exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4  
Including one time items  the company s reported EPS was 94 cents  up 19  year over year 
Total Revenue
Revenues dropped 2 4  year over year to  673 2 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  673 3 million  by a whisker  This decline in revenue growth can be attributed to lower sales in the company s U S    Canada and international segments  which were partially offset by the sales improvement in the manufacturing wholesale segment  excluding intersegment sales  Moreover  the fourth quarter sale of GNC Holdings  Discount Supplements business also affected total revenue growth of second quarter 2016  by  6 6 million 
Same store sales dropped 3 7  in domestic company owned stores  including GNC com sales  during the second quarter  while in domestic franchise locations  same store sales fell 6 6  
 GNC HOLDINGS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Segment in Details
Starting from second quarter 2016  GNC Holdings is reporting its operations in three segments  U S    Canada   including company owned stores in the U S   Puerto Rico and Canada  franchise stores in the U S  and e commerce  International   including franchise locations in approximately 50 countries  The Health Store and China operations and Manufacturing   Wholesale  including manufactured product sold to other segments  third party contract manufacturing and sales to wholesale partners 
During the reported quarter  GNC Holdings  revenues from the U S    Canada segment dropped 2  to  570 9 million  primarily on the back of a decline in same store sales in both company owned and franchise stores  Domestic franchise revenues fell 2 1  to  86 5 million  primarily due to lower wholesale sales and royalties  Weakness in the food and protein categories  as well as continued softness in Vitamins and Vitapaks  coupled with softer than expected traffic trends  largely affected this segment s growth in the second quarter  
Revenues at the international segment declined 2 5  to  43 1 million primarily on account of a decline of 1 6  in international franchisees same store sales  at constant exchange rate  However a revenue increase of  1 5 million contributed by GNC Holdings  China business partially neutralized this decline 
Revenues from the manufacturing wholesale segment  excluding intersegment revenues  improved 5 3  to  59 2 million  Within this segment  third party contract manufacturing sales increased 18 3  to  33 7 million  which was partially offset by an 8 1  decline in wholesale sales of  2 2 million and a 22 4  plunge in intersegment sales of  56 6 million 
Margin
Gross profit deteriorated 6 9  in the reported quarter to  238 7 million  Consequently  gross margin contracted 170 basis points  bps  to 35 5   owing to lower sales  lower product margins in the company s GNC com business and deleverage of occupancy costs as a result of the negative same store sales 
Selling  general and administrative expenses dropped 0 8  to  139 million  However  adjusted operating margin deteriorated 210 bps to 14 8  during the quarter  due to higher decline in gross profit 
Financial Position
GNC Holdings exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  48 2 million  compared with  61 million at the end of first quarter 2016  As of Jun 30  2016  the company generated cash of  130 9 million from operating activities  compared with  184 2 million a year ago 
During the second quarter  management bought back shares worth roughly  28 million and had a remaining cash balance of  48 million available in hand  The company also paid  28 million in cash dividends on its common stock as of Jun 30  2016  Further  the company generated free cash flow of  110 6 million  reflecting a year over year decline of 32 7  
Moreover  during the second quarter earnings release  GNC Holdings declared a cash dividend of 20 cents per share of its common stock for the third quarter 2016  payable on or about Sep 30  2016 to its stockholders of record at the close of business as on Sep 16  2016 
2016 Outlook
Assuming the weakening performance of the company to continue in the remaining quarters of 2016  management has temporarily suspended its previously announced earnings guidance for 2016   However  management remains committed to deliver improved performance in the near future 
Our Take
GNC Holdings ended second quarter 2016 on a disappointing note as its revenue figure failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate   Although earnings surpassed the same  it was on account of considerably lower number of weighted average common shares outstanding and not any strong fundamental on the company s part  
Not only did the company lags in the domestic market  its operating results in overseas was equally disappointing  Foreign currency also played spoilsport  particularly in Mexico  In Turkey  macroeconomic challenges hampered growth  That said  it is worth mentioning that management still believes that international markets hold a tremendous potential for GNC Holdings and is thus engaged in capitalizing its opportunities in there  However  the temporary suspension of 2016 outlook is quite discouraging as it points to no major improvement in GNC Holdings  operation  at least in the near term

Our Take

Nevertheless  the record commercial system placement in the quarter buoys optimism  Moreover  the company made solid progress in terms of its test menu expansion as well as potential pipeline development  The raised EPS guidance for 2016 also indicates further recovery through the rest of 2016

Earnings also comfortably exceeded the company provided guidance of 46 49 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a solid 29 2  
Strong better than expected  double digit revenue growth was the key catalyst behind the earnings improvement in the second quarter 

Revenues 
Revenues improved 28 6  year over year to  269 4 million in the quarter and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  260 million  The top line also surpassed the company s expectation of  253 3  258 3 million 
Per management  on a year over year basis  Align s second quarter revenue growth was affected by approximately 4 points owing to the Additional Aligner policy change that management implemented in Jul 2015 
The year over year upside in the top line was driven by strong double digit growth observed in both the operating segments of the company 
Geographically  Align witnessed Invisalign case volume of 15 3  in North America and 38 3  in the overseas ALIGN TECH INC Price and Consensus
    
Segments in Detail
Revenues from the Invisalign Clear Aligner segment  90 3  of total revenue  increased 21 2  year over year to  243 4 million in the reported quarter  primarily driven by continued  strong Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies  as well as a price increase in North America and International  However  these positive factors were partially offset by lower ASPs on account of the Aligner policy change implemented last year 
In the quarter  Invisalign case shipments amounted to 177 000  up 22 4  year over year  aided by growth across all regions  During the second quarter  Align added 2 885 new Invisalign doctors worldwide  out of which 1 125 were from North America while 1 760 were from international regions 
Revenues from Scanner and Service  9 7   improved a massive 199  to  26 million in the reported quarter  on account of an increased demand for the new iTero Element scanner 
Margins
Gross margin improved 50 basis points  bps  year over year to 76 2   Clear Aligner gross margin expanded 30 bps year over year to 78 6   The gross margin improvement primarily exhibited benefits that Align gained from leveraging its fixed cost over higher case volumes  which was partially neutralized by lower ASPs as a result of the additional Aligner policy 
During the quarter  Align witnessed a 20 7  year over year increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to  121 5 million and an 18 7  hike in research and development  R D  expenses to  18 6 million  However  the operating margin improved 400 bps to 24 2   due to higher gross margin 
Financial Details
Align exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of  571 8 million  up from  548 1 million at the end of first quarter of 2016  The company had no debt at the end of the second quarter 
During the second quarter  Align generated  76 2 million in cash flow from operations  resulting in free cash flow of  57 3 million 
In the second quarter  Align bought back shares worth  50 million and has received an initial delivery of approximately 0 5 million shares based on current market prices  Upon completion of this agreement  Align will initiate repurchasing an additional  50 0 million of its common stock on the open market  These two actions will complete the Apr 2014 stock repurchase program worth  300 million 
During the quarter Align also announced a new plan to repurchase up to an additional  300 0 million of its stock  all of which remains available for repurchase as of Jun 30  2016 
Guidance
For the third quarter of 2016  the company projects EPS of 49 52 cents on revenues of  267 2  273 5 million  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS and revenues are pegged at 51 cents and  259 2 million  respectively 
The company also expects to register Clear Aligner case shipments in the range of 174 200 176 900 up approximately 18 1  to 19 9  from the year ago level 
Our Take
Align Technology ended second quarter on a promising note  squarely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  We are also upbeat about the continued strong Invisalign volumes registered by the company  which in turn drove the top and the bottom line during the quarter 
The company also has a strong cash balance position that enables it to adopt attractive share repurchase programs and in turn pay back solid returns to its investors  Going forward  management anticipates witnessing consistent growth in its Asia Pacific region  which will mitigate the typical seasonality it usually experiences in the European nations

Net loss in the reported quarter was  6 1 million compared with a net loss of  9 2 million in the year ago quarter 
Per management  this net loss figure included a tax expense of  1 4 million that the company incurred on account of investment in a marketable security and a gain on sale of  0 6 million on the same marketable security 

Revenues in Detail
Total revenue in the quarter grew 16  year over year to  82 million and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  81 million  At constant exchange rate or CER  revenues improved 18   Strong growth across both the U S  and international markets drove the top line improvement 
Geographically  Genomic Health s second quarter revenues in the U S  improved 15  to  69 6 million  while international revenues surged 24   up 26  at constant exchange rate or CER  at  12 3 million  The U S  revenue growth was fueled by U S  invasive breast cancer revenue growth of 13  as well as Prostate test revenues which contributed 3  to top line growth in the U S  Moreover  revenues from the oncology franchise  which grew 13  in the U S   also contributed to this growth 
On the other hand  international revenue growth came on back of the strong performance that Genomic Health delivered in the markets of Western Europe  particularly the U K  and France  Besides  international tests delivered in the reported quarter increased 23  from the prior year level and represented approximately 23  of the total test volume 
During the quarter  the company delivered more than 29 060 Oncotype DX test results  up 12  year over year 
 GENOMIC HEALTH Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Margin Trends
In the quarter under review  Genomic Health s gross margin contracted 10 basis points  bps  year over year to 81 4  owing to 16 8  rise in cost of product revenues of  15 2 million 
On the other hand  Genomic Health witnessed a 5  rise in operating expenses to  71 9 million owing to an 11 8  rise in general and administrative expenses to  18 5 million  5  increase in research and development expenses to  15 3 million and a 2  rise in selling and marketing expenses to  38 million 
In the reported quarter  Genomic Health recorded an operating loss of  5 1 million  exhibiting an improvement of 52 9  from the year ago equivalent  owing to higher revenue growth compared to rise in cost of sales and operating expense 
Financial Update
Genomic Health exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities  including a corporate equity investment  of  93 6 million  compared with  86 4 million at the end of the first quarter 2016 
2016 Guidance     
Genomic Health has narrowed its earlier provided revenue guidance for full year 2016  The company currently expects to generate revenues in the band of  325  335 in 2016  reflecting annualized growth of 13  17    as against earlier guidance of  320  335 million  representing annualized growth of 12  17    The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  330 million  in line with the mid point of the guidance 
On the bottom line front  the company continues to anticipate a net loss of  12  18 million at the mid point of revenue guidance  excluding the effect of the company s investment in a marketable security   or net loss per share of 37 55 cents  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss stands at 46 cents for 2016 
Moreover  company now expects to deliver Oncotype DX tests in the band of 118 500 and 121 000  representing annualized growth of 10  13   in 2016  as against 117 500 121 000   representing annualized growth of 10  13   
Our Take
Genomic Health ended second quarter 2016 on a satisfactory note  While the company s second quarter bottom line outcome improved year over year and came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the top line managed to beat the mark  Moreover  Genomic Health continued to experience strong test volume as well as revenue growth  across its global region 
However  gross margin continued to be feeble as the company has been witnessing for past few quarters  Further  fluctuations in the price of the marketable security continued to hamper the stock  which going forward is expected to remain for the rest of 2016 
Nevertheless  we were encouraged to note that despite a huge rise in cost of sales  the gross margin decline was comparatively moderate  on account of a higher pace of revenue growth

Adjusted EPS also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents  The year over year earnings improvement was driven by strong revenue growth in the quarter 
Including one time adjustments  Henry Schein s reported net income in the second quarter was  120 1 million or  1 46 per share  reflecting a year over year improvement of 1 8  and 4 3   respectively 

Revenues in Detail
Henry Schein reported revenues of  2 873 billion in the second quarter  up 9 3  year over year  The top line also comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 840 billion  The year over year improvement came on the back of 9 7  growth in local currencies with a 7 6  and a 2 1  rise in internal sales and acquisitions  respectively  However  unfavorable foreign currency exchange accounted for a decline of 0 4  in overall revenue growth 
Region wise  Henry Schein experienced 9 8  year over year sales growth in the North American market  while sales in the international market improved 8 1  
Segment Analysis     
Henry Schein derives revenues from four operating segments  Dental  Medical  Animal Health  and Technology and Value added services 
In the second quarter  the company derived  1 4 billion in revenues from global Dental sales  up 4  year over year  including local currency growth of 4 1  and a 0 1  decline owing to unfavorable foreign exchange   Local currency growth comprised acquisition growth of 1 3  and internal sales rise of 2 8   The Dental franchise witnessed an improvement of 2 1  in North America while international sales grew 7 2

Worldwide Medical sales scaled up 14 5  year over year to  538 8 million based on local currency growth of 14 5   Foreign currency exchange had no impact on this segment s revenue growth in the second quarter  The local currency growth was solely driven by 14 5  growth in internal sales 
Revenues from global Technology and Value added Services grew 19 6  to  107 million  This included a 20 4  rise in local currencies  with acquisition growth of 12 3  and internal sales improvement of 8 1   However  revenues at this segment declined 0 8  due to unfavorable foreign currency HENRY SCHEIN IN Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Margin Trends
Gross profit increased 7  to  803 3 million in the reported quarter  However  gross margin dropped 60 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter to 28   due to a 10 1  rise in cost of sales  higher than the revenue growth rate   
Backed by a 7 5  rise in selling  general   administrative expenses to  602 million  adjusted operating income improved 5 7  year over year to  201 1 million on account of higher gross profit  However  adjusted operating margin declined 20 bps to 7  in the reported quarter as the rise in operating expense was more than gross profit growth 
Financial Position
Henry Schein exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  63 6 million  compared with  71 6 million at the end of first quarter of 2016  In the second quarter  net cash flow from operating activities was  274 4 million  compared to the year ago equivalent of  207 8 million  
During the quarter under review  the company bought back approximately 0 3 million shares for  57 million and was left with  243 million worth of repurchase authorization 
Guidance
Henry Schein lowered its adjusted EPS guidance for 2016  The company currently expects to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of  6 55  6 60  reflecting 10 11  year over year growth  compared to earlier guidance of  6 55  6 65  reflecting 10  12  year over year growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 is  6 64  above the company s guided range 
Our Take
Henry Schein ended second quarter of 2016 on an impressive note  squarely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company s strong share gains in both North American and overseas markets along with the strong revenues raise optimism  This in turn drove the double digit growth in the company s adjusted EPS figure 
However  we are disappointed with respect to the company s updated EPS guidance for 2016  wherein management has lowered the upper end of the previously provided guidance range  despite each segments posting strong sales growth  The year over year deterioration in Henry Schein s gross margin figure on the back of higher cost of sales also depresses us  Meanwhile  foreign currency fluctuations continued to hamper the company s business 
Although the company s weakness in North American Dental sales was less than company s expectation  its recent investment in Custom Automated Prosthetics   a U S  digital laboratory supply company offering CAD CAM equipment and zirconia materials  buoys optimism

22739,244254,NTUS,Thermo Fisher  TMO  Tops Q2 Earnings  Sales  Updates View,opinion,"Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc    NYSE TMO   reported better than expected second quarter 2016 financial results  Adjusted earnings per share  EPS  in the quarter came in at  2 03  1 5  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and ahead of the year ago quarter number by 10 3  
On a reported basis  second quarter EPS from continuing operations of  1 30 showed a 2 4  improvement year over year 
Quarter in Detail
Revenues for the reported quarter amounted to  4 54 billion  up 6  year over year  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 50 billion  Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 4   While revenues grew 3  on the back of acquisitions  it was slightly offset by currency translation 
 THERMO FISHER Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Thermo Fisher currently operates in four business segments  Life Sciences Solutions  Analytical Instruments  Specialty Diagnostics  and Laboratory Products and Services 
Impressively  Thermo Fisher delivered positive year over year growth in each of its business segments during the second quarter  Revenues from the Life Sciences Solutions Segment improved 13  year over year to  1 28 billion  while Analytical Instruments Segment sales grew 2  to  794 million  Revenues from the Laboratory Products and Services Segment improved 6  to  1 80 billion  while the Specialty Diagnostics Segment recorded 4  revenue growth to  851 million 
Gross margin of 48 2  during the second quarter was up 20 basis points  bps  year over year on account of higher revenue growth  despite a 5 7  increase in cost of sales  Adjusted operating margin also improved approximately 20 bps to 22 3   inspite of the company incurring a 6 9  rise in selling  general and administrative expenses and a 4 5  increase in research and development expenses 
The company exited the second quarter of 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of  663 1 million compared with  826 8 million at the end of first quarter 2016  Operating cash flow for the quarter was  1 18 billion compared with the year ago figure of  0 8 billion 
Guidance
Thermo Fisher has updated its full year 2016 financial guidance  primarily based on two factors   a strong operating performance in the first half 2016  and more unfavorable foreign exchange environment   Adjusted EPS is currently expected in the range of  8 07 to  8 20  indicating 9  to 11  growth year over year  earlier guidance was  8 05 to  8 19 and growth of 9  to 11   
The company expects to deliver revenues in the range of  17 84 billion to  18 00 billion  earlier  17 86 billion to  18 04 billion  in 2016  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at earnings of  8 13 per share and revenues of  17 96 billion  within the company s expectation 
Bottom Line
Thermo Fisher s financial numbers squarely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter  in line with the trend that the company displayed at the start of 2016  We remain encouraged with the company s recent product launches during the second quarter along with a strong growth in emerging markets and an enhancement management observed in the company s customer value proposition 
Looking ahead Thermo Fisher s pending acquisition of FEI  is expected to add leading capabilities in electron microscopy to the company that in turn will complement its analytical instruments portfolio  However  the reduced revenue guidance on management s part  on account of unfavourable currency fluctuation disappoints us

Thermo Fisher currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked medical stocks are Abiomed  Inc    NASDAQ ABMD    Masimo Corp    NASDAQ MASI   and Natus Medical Inc    NASDAQ BABY     All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ",2016-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/thermo-fisher-(tmo)-tops-q2-earnings,-sales;-updates-view-200144806",200144806
