Another chapter in the Xerox  HP story
The development extends what s become a heated saga that first took shape in early November  when Xerox made its first official overture to the computer giant  That initial offer valued HP around  33 5 billion  and  like Tuesday s  was a mostly cash offer 

HP s board of directors rejected that bid in no uncertain terms though  telling the suitor that price underestimates the potential of a reinvigorated HP  Xerox pushed back  threatening to initiate a hostile takeover of the company if an amicable one was out of reach 
The company has yet to act on that threat  though did underscore the prospect in early January when it announced it had secured  24 billion worth of funding to move forward with the deal  whichever approach would be required 
Activist inspired
The push for the pairing of the two companies is seemingly being supplied by Carl Icahn  who holds roughly 4  of HP shares and owns almost 11  of Xerox  The activist investor would be one of the biggest immediate beneficiaries of the transaction in question  though the long term synergies of a united HP and Xerox remain unclear to some analysts ",2020-02-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pthe7,2081111

Hon Hai  which makes the vast majority of the world s iPhones from the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou  is now projecting a sales increase of 1  to 3  this year  Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News in a text message  That s down from a Jan  22 forecast of 3  to 5   before the epidemic spread around the globe  and lags the 5 4  average of analysts  projections 
The contagion is expected to disrupt Apple s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China  while also dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth  Hon Hai  an important manufacturer also for major brands from HP Inc  NYSE HPQ   to Sony Corp  T 6758    said Tuesday it still expects to be able to restart facilities throughout China on schedule  according to a text message sent to Bloomberg News  Suppliers such as Quanta Computer Inc   Inventec Corp  and LG Display Co  also said they would go back to work next week in China

But while Chinese officials and companies have targeted Feb  10 as the date to resume work in much of the country  doubts about the timing have grown in recent days as the virus death toll rises  workers find themselves stuck in municipal lockdowns and the transport of people and goods has been hampered 
 Given current market conditions  we are lowering to 1  3    Liu replied when asked about whether Hon Hai will cut its original sales growth forecast for this year 
Hon Hai s shares stood largely unchanged Wednesday after having slid about 11  since a broader Asian market selloff began in mid January 
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai s lower 2020 sales growth outlook of 1 3  vs  3 5  just a week ago likely reflects the severity of disruption to its operations from the coronavirus outbreak  in our view  The NT 111 billion reduction in sales at the midpoint of the range vs  the prior midpoint is equivalent to one week of revenue  accounting for the extended factory shutdown imposed by the Chinese government

Ink stained sales
Sales for both HP printer supplies and consumer hardware have been in decline in recent quarters  In its fiscal fourth quarter  which ended in October  HP reported printing revenue was down 6  year over year with operating margins of 15 6   down from 16  last year  For the full year  net revenue is down 4   suggesting the slide is accelerating 
Part of the decline has been due to third party supplies  to which HP responded with a new targeted marketing campaign highlighting the quality  sustainability  and security of HP supplies  a move it expects will gain traction in 2020  But with the price of printers so low and the cost of consumables so high  it s almost more cost effective to throw out your printer when you run out of ink and buy a new one  In fact  I did throw out my printer several years ago  but never replaced it  
My needs for printing have dried up as quickly as an inkjet cartridge  so if I do need a hard copy of a document  I use EFI s PrintMe service  You upload the document to the cloud and print it out at one of thousands of locations worldwide  such as a Staples  Office Depot  hotel  or university  making it a far more cost effective printing solution  
Breaking the mold
HP has sought to offset that by offering subscription based models  like Instant Ink  which it launched in 2013  which allows consumers to have ink delivered before they run out  The monthly fee is based on the number of pages printed  not the amount of ink used  so for high volume users  it could be a worthwhile option  
The tech company said its contractual business for services like Instant Ink was up double digits in the fourth quarter  but that s not going to be enough to make a difference  As the market leader in printers accounting for two out of every five printers shipped  it needs to do something bold 
While consumers will still be able to buy a dirt cheap HP printer  they won t be able to use just as cheap consumables in it  The printers will accept only official HP supplies  If you want to use third party consumables  well  that s going to cost you  HP is going to raise the cost of printers that accept outside vendor supplies 
It s basically the model used by mobile phone manufacturers  If you want to bring your own service and buy an unlocked phone  it s going to be more costly than buying a locked phone and staying in the provider s network 
Follow my lead   please
It s a risky strategy for an industry that has relied upon the razor and blade model for decades  particularly for HP  as there is no certainty that it will resonate with consumers or that other printer makers will follow HP s lead 
If the printer industry balks  HP will be the one with what look like higher cost machines on store shelves  Total cost of ownership doesn t often fly with consumers  who are often looking only at base prices 
It certainly won t be a quick turnaround for HP s printing business  as it will take time to educate consumers  If it works  it could make the printing business profitable again  but if it doesn t  HP could be see its stock plunge once again ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pidcp,2060084
204864,426380,HPQ,A Better Year for PCs Doesn t Make HP a Buy,news,"Good news for personal computer manufacturers    finally  Technology market research outfit Gartner estimates that thanks to Q4 s 2 3  year over year growth in PC purchases  2019 s total PC shipments grew 0 6   IDC pegs the full year growth figure at 2 7  
Neither is tremendous  but the first annual growth in personal computer deliveries since 2011 is still a big relative victory for names like HP and Dell Technologies  Things might have been even better had Intel  NASDAQ INTC  not hit a couple of production speed bumps 
If you think the data marks a lasting turning point for HP and the personal computer industry  though  know you re going against the grain  Gartner believes the PC market is poised to run into a headwind    as does IDC    and the company s printer business continues to shrink as well  Contrary to glimmers of hope that seemed to start shining late last year  there s no proverbial light at the end of the tunnel 
Artificial  temporary demand
There will come a time when consumers and smaller businesses alike have to invest in new hardware  There s only so much life anyone can squeeze out of an aging PC  and there s only so much functionality that can be extracted from alternatives like smartphones or tablets  Factor in that the stock s trading at a trailing twelve month P E of nearly 10 and that Xerox  NYSE XRX  continues to make acquisition overtures  and it seems like investors could certainly do worse than take a shot on a still subdued HP 
But they could also do better than HP at the stock s current price  A lot better 

The strong quarterly finish to last year may have had more to do with the impending end of  free  support for Windows 7  and less to do with firm interest in newer computers  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  officially ended regular updates of the Windows 7 operating system on January 14th  with the earliest machines that natively used the OS now more than ten years old 
Moreover  some businesses rush to make purchases before the year end for tax purposes  driving the uncharacteristic surge in demand during the quarter  Without those boosts  it s possible neither PC sales report would have looked so strong

Value minded investors expecting a recovery of the PC market to buoy HP in the near future will point out that there are on the order of 300 million computers in use that still utilize Windows 7  And those supporters are correct 
Those Windows 7 machines won t necessarily be replaced  however  and won t necessarily be replaced anytime soon if they re going to be replaced at all  Most Windows 7 devices can run Windows 10  which Microsoft still provides free of charge  Meanwhile  those computer owners may be holding out for more availability of Intel chips  There s also a sliver of these computer users that may simply not care about using a now outdated operating system 
Whatever the reason    and despite the sheer age of most Windows 7 computers    the disinterest has prompted both Dell and HP to dish out cautious outlooks for a sizable portion of this year  IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani agrees with the worry  commenting on IDC s analysis   Despite the positivity surrounding 2019  the next twelve to eighteen months will be challenging for traditional PCs as the majority of Windows 10 upgrades will be in the rearview mirror and lingering concerns around component shortages and trade negotiations get ironed out  
Gartner s senior principal analyst Mikako Kitagawa is concerned as well  but for the longer term  Within the commentary of 2019 s PC report  she conceded   Looking ahead  Gartner predicts a continuous decline in the consumer PC market over the next five years   before going on to explain that innovation will be the critical factor in keeping the personal computer market propped up 
Whatever lies ahead  note that of the three major tech names in the personal computer business  HP saw the least growth in 2019  It appears to be the weakest of the weak  with analysts still modeling deteriorating results into 2022 

 Pushing the rock up the hill 
Simply put  neither of HP s core markets is in a great position to support a lasting turnaround 
On the PC front  it would require the convergence of the next version of Windows  and the availability of next gen hardware from Intel and its rivals  and a giant leap in the functionality of netbooks and laptops  all at the same time  to put the personal computer market back on a longer term  meaningful growth track  None of those are on the horizon at this time 
As for printing  it s never going away entirely  but consumers and companies alike are printing about 20  fewer documents than they were as recently as 2015 as digital storage options ramp up  And  to the extent printing is still needed  consumers and companies appear to be finding cheaper ink cartridges made by Chinese manufacturers  eating into the company s higher margin business 

As NPD analyst Stephen Baker put it in November when Xerox first expressed interest  the company has  done the best they can  but they are pushing the rock up the hill   Gartner s and IDC s compelling 2019 numbers don t alter that overarching reality ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pixh8,2061256

205043,426559,HPQ,Paid late  some ex staffers of White House hopeful Fiorina won t sign on again,news,"By Michelle Conlin NEW YORK  Reuters    Politics has a well known revolving door  with candidates often rehiring consultants  strategists and vendors as they move from one campaign to the next  But for Republican presidential contender Carly Fiorina  that might not be so easy  Twelve of about 30 people who worked on Fiorina s failed 2010 California Senate campaign  most speaking out for the first time  told Reuters they would not work for her again  Fiorina  once one of America s most powerful businesswomen  is now campaigning for the Republican nomination in 2016  The reason  for more than four years  Fiorina   who has an estimated net worth of up to  120 million   didn t pay them  a review of Federal Election Commission records shows   On the campaign trail  the former Hewlett Packard  N HPQ  CEO has portrayed herself as a battle hardened business leader who possesses the best financial skills among fellow Republican presidential hopefuls  But some former staffers on her Senate campaign are now raising questions about that portrayal   Federal campaign filings show that  until a few months before Fiorina announced her presidential bid on May 4  she still owed staffers  consultants  strategists  legal experts and vendors nearly half a million dollars   FEC records show  for example  that her former campaign manager Martin Wilson was owed  80 500  legal counsel Ben Ginsberg  60 000  and the widow of California political adviser Joe Shumate  who died during the final month of the campaign  at least  30 000  Ultimately  Fiorina paid them  Fiorina s campaign declined to give reasons for the delay  which was first reported in the San Francisco Chronicle    I d rather go to Iraq than work for Carly Fiorina again   said one high level former campaign staffer  who asked not to be identified  citing disclosure restrictions in his contract   It s not common for campaigns to end in debt but not extraordinary either  said Trevor Potter  a Republican former FEC chairman  Usually wealthy candidates pay off the debts themselves  as a matter of honor and reputation because they feel badly about vendors who are stuck with these debts   Even so  one Fiorina Senate campaign worker who was owed money  California fundraiser Ann Kramer  said the time it took for her to get repaid didn t trouble her   I don t fault Carly at all   Kramer said   I love Carly   Kramer said she is now helping Fiorina fundraise for her presidential bid   Neither Fiorina s campaign  nor the fundraising group Carly for America  a Super PAC affiliated with Fiorina  responded to requests for comment about the former staffers  complaints  though Fiorina presidential campaign spokeswoman Anna Epstein said that the money was  owed by an entity   Carly for California  Not owed personally by Carly    WHAT ABOUT CLINTON  OBAMA        Leslie Shedd  Carly for America s spokeswoman  said   As is common with many campaigns   including both Barack Obama s re election in 2012 and Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in 2008   there was some leftover debt with Carly Fiorina s Senate campaign in 2010  However  this issue has been resolved and the campaign debt has been paid off in full   At the end of her 2008 presidential bid  Clinton owed  12 million to nearly 500 staffers  consultants and vendors  according to campaign finance website Opensecrets org  FEC documents show Clinton paid off the bulk of her leftover debts by the third quarter of 2009   Clinton did continue to owe money  about  845 000  to one firm  that of her pollster Mark Penn  which her campaign steadily chipped away at over the course of the next three years  the records show  As secretary of state  Clinton was banned from fundraising to clear the debt  but both President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton helped fundraise the money  The Clinton campaign and Penn s office did not respond to requests for comment   Obama s 2012 re election campaign ended with  5 6 million in debt  As of April   2 3 million of that is still on the books  FEC records show  Obama s campaign did not respond to requests for comment  BILL STILL UNPAID One consulting firm who did work for Fiorina s joint fundraising committee  East Meridian Strategies  said it has not been repaid the  9 000 the committee still owes it for a bulk mailing it did   I can confirm we have not been paid   said firm partner Jon Seaton  who is working on Republican Senator Lindsey Graham s presidential bid  Emails reviewed by Reuters show that Fiorina s campaign finance manager  Joanne Davis  acknowledged the debt and said it would be paid  Davis did not respond to requests for comment  Sarah Isgur Flores  deputy campaign manager of Fiorina s presidential campaign  said   That s odd because that debt didn t show up on any FEC report for years  which they could have contested at any point  And now   3 years after the committee has been terminated by the FEC   they are claiming they are owed money   The FEC declined to comment   A number of former campaign workers said they were

205081,426597,HPQ,U S  judge scrutinizes HP shareholder deal in Autonomy case,news,"By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    A U S  judge on Friday sharply questioned provisions of a shareholder settlement that would release Hewlett Packard Co  N HPQ  executives from liability over the computing company s botched acquisition of Autonomy Plc 
At a hearing in San Francisco federal court  U S  District Judge Charles Breyer asked whether HP officials  including Chief Executive Meg Whitman  were getting too broad of a pass from potential shareholder claims related to their leadership 
 The release appears to be staggering in its breadth   Breyer said  adding that he had not yet decided whether to reject the deal 
HP announced a  8 8 billion writedown in November 2012  just over one year after buying Autonomy  and linked more than  5 billion to accounting fraud and inflated financials by Autonomy executives  The British company and its executives have denied any wrongdoing 
Under the settlement  shareholder attorneys agreed to drop all claims against HP s current and former executives  including Whitman  board members and advisers to the company  In return  the company agreed to corporate governance reforms on how it handles acquisitions 
In court on Friday Breyer said the settlement  as currently written  could absolve HP executives from shareholder liability on subjects beyond the Autonomy deal 
 The question I have to determine is whether that s fair   Breyer said 
Originally  the settlement called for HP to pay shareholder attorneys at least  18 million to jointly pursue those claims  but those fees were removed from the deal due to concerns previously expressed by Breyer 
Earlier this week CalPERS called on Breyer to reject the deal unless the parties disclosed a revised fee amount  The agreement now calls for about  8 7 million in fees for plaintiff attorneys  according to documents filed late on Thursday 
HP has said it intends to sue former Autonomy CEO Michael Lynch and Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain  as well as the British unit of Deloitte   Touche 
Multiple parties have objected to the shareholder settlement  including Hussain  who called it collusive

205089,426605,HPQ,Hewlett Packard posts surprise revenue gain after PC sales jump,news,"By Edwin Chan SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Hewlett Packard Co posted a surprise increase in quarterly revenue after sales from its personal computer division climbed 12 percent  but a flat to declining performance from its other units underscored the company s uphill battle to revive growth 
HP sales rose a mere 1 percent to  27 6 billion in its fiscal third quarter from  27 2 billion a year earlier  Wall Street analysts had forecast a modest drop in revenue to  27 01 billion 
The Silicon Valley giant is undergoing a major overhaul aimed at cutting costs and re orienting itself toward higher margin businesses such as computing infrastructure  It s trying to reduce a reliance on PCs and move toward servers  storage and networking for enterprises   part of Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman s effort to return the sprawling company to growth 
Whitman credited personal computer demand for  coming back some  as consumers and corporations upgraded ageing machines  She was pleased with 2 percent growth in revenue to  6 9 billion at the Enterprise Group  the company s second largest business that deals in networking  storage and servers 
 It s a turnaround in a declining business   Whitman said in an interview  She singled out a 9 percent increase in sales of industry standard servers in particular  saying uncertainty around Lenovo s acquisition of IBM Corp s low end server unit helped steer business to HP 
 We ve been able to capitalize on that uncertainty and our win rates are up against IBM   Whitman added 
She pegged Russia and China   countries whose relations with the United States have come under strain   as weak spots for PC sales  though Whitman said its Chinese business as a whole remained on solid footing 
HP intends to remain rigorous on costs to try and boost profitability  In May  it estimated another 11 000 to 16 000 more jobs needed to be cut on top of 34 000 previously announced 
It narrowed its earnings forecast for the full year to  3 70 to  3 74 per share  from  3 63 to  3 75  The company posted  1 7 billion or 89 cents per share of non gaap diluted net earnings in the third quarter  up 3 percent and in line with forecasts 
Whitman said HP was assessing its  4 billion software business in view of an industry migration toward Internet based or cloud software  And she said the company  with  4 9 billion in operating company net cash at the end of the fiscal third quarter  could make acquisitions if needed 
The company prefers to build its own capabilities and buying when it cannot develop inhouse  Whitman told analysts on a conference call  HP also remains committed to returning at least half its cash flow to shareholders  via dividends and buybacks 
 We re in a position to make acquisitions the way we weren t over the past year   she said 

Shares of the company dipped 0 8 percent to  34 84 after hours  They closed at  35 12 on the New York Stock Exchange

205091,426607,HPQ,U S  judge questions shareholder settlement with HP over Autonomy,news,"By Dan Levine
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    A U S  judge cast doubt on Monday over a proposed agreement struck between Hewlett Packard Co and plaintiff shareholders to settle a lawsuit over the computing giant s botched acquisition of Autonomy Plc 
At a hearing on Monday in San Francisco  U S  District Judge Charles Breyer rejected several million dollars in fees that shareholder attorneys would have recouped under the settlement   That s out   he said 
In order to approve the remainder of the deal  Breyer said he would have to make further inquiries into whether dismissing claims against HP officers  including current Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman  was fair for shareholders 
HP announced a  8 8 billion writedown in November 2012  just over one year after buying Autonomy  and linked more than  5 billion to accounting fraud and inflated financials by Autonomy executives  The British company and its executives have denied any wrongdoing 
Under the terms of the settlement reached in June  shareholder attorneys agreed to drop all claims against HP s current and former executives  including Whitman  board members and advisers to the company 
HP  in turn  agreed to team up with the shareholder attorneys to bring claims against former Autonomy executives  including Chief Executive Michael Lynch  The shareholder attorneys would have recouped at least  18 million in fees 
In court on Monday  HP attorney Marc Wolinsky disclosed that HP also intends to sue the British unit of Deloitte   Touche LLP  DLTE UL  over its role in auditing Autonomy Plc  In a statement  Deloitte said any HP claim  would be utterly without merit and we will defend ourselves strongly against it  
HP s allegations of accounting improprieties  misrepresentation and disclosure failures at Autonomy have prompted an investigation by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  as well as the UK s Serious Fraud Office 
Multiple parties objected to the shareholder settlement  including former Autonomy Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain  In court on Monday  Hussain s attorney John Keker called the deal a  whitewash  and asked that he be allowed to review internal HP documents that absolve Whitman and others of wrongdoing 
 This is a joke   Keker said   If it were a carcass  animals would walk around it  it stinks so much  
Wolinsky said HP would vigorously contest Hussain s ability to review documents  In a statement  HP said it will continue to with its bid to settle or dismiss the shareholder litigation 
Breyer scheduled another court hearing next month to decide how to move forward  and whether Hussain and others would be allowed to formally intervene in the case 
Regardless  Breyer said he would need to weigh the evidence against HP officers as part of his analysis on whether the deal absolving them of liability is fair for shareholders 
 Something went terribly wrong   Breyer said of the Autonomy acquisition

205165,426681,HPQ,HPQ  The Price Of Cowardice,opinion,"I wanted to share two related experiences last week  They do not reflect well on me  but if nothing else  Slope is known for being open and honest  so we might as well continue that tradition 
Let s begin with this beauty  HP Inc  NYSE HPQ  





I came into the day short HPQ  I want to say at the outset this was a rational decision  In fact  the chart was pretty damn gorgeous  However  between sessions  rumors flew around that XRX wanted to buy HPQ  so the stock exploded higher 
I was  of course  unhappy about this  The stock was up about 14   and it was utterly unclear if there was a deal  what the price would be  and so forth  In pre marketing trading  the stock kept lunging higher  and       simply stated     I wanted the pain to stop  so I decided to get out of HPQ ASAP  I wanted nothing to do with it anymore  So I covered at about the spot where that arrow is drawn 
You can probably guess what happened next  Within moments of my covering in a panic  the stock started slipping lower  and it never stopped falling  And it s not because the rumors were denied  In fact  XRX made it quite clear they had made the offer  and HPQ said they were considering it  But I covered at just about the worst price of the day  It went on to keep sinking on Thursday and Friday  in spite of the market vomiting to lifetime highs 
So that sucked 
Since God figured I hadn t been mentally beaten quite yet  it was time for more fun  After Thursday s close  Stamps com came out with earnings  and     yep     it exploded higher and     yep     I was short  Sounds like I must have broken a mirror recently  doesn t it 
With the memory of HPQ fresh in my head  and my anger at myself for being a completely limp wristed ghey boy and covering  I kept telling myself  don t do it again  don t do it again  don t do it again  But I kept having visions of a 18  pop becoming 20   30   50   God knows what  Thus  I did something I hardly ever do  which is entered an after hours order and got out where the arrow is  Again  to stop the pain

205177,426693,HPQ,Is HP  HPQ  Stock A Suitable Pick For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  HP has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 62  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 52  If we focus on the long term PE trend  HP s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 34  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that HP has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 54  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for HP stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  HP has a P S ratio of about 0 48  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 26 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  HPQ is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  HP currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes HP a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 79  which is better than the industry average of 11 33  Clearly  HPQ is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though HP might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives HPQ a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen five upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below HP Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHP is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 20  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are

205199,426715,HPQ,Cisco  CSCO  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  57 56 in the previous session  Cisco Systems has gained 31 8  since the start of the year compared to the 16 8  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 32 4  return for the Zacks Computer   Networking industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 15  2019  Cisco reported EPS of  0 78 versus consensus estimate of  0 77 
For the current fiscal year  Cisco is expected to post earnings of  3 08 per share on  51 86 billion in revenues  This represents a 18 46  change in EPS on a 5 12  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 43 per share on  53 79 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 32  and 3 73   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Cisco may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Cisco has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 18 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 20 1X versus its peer group s average of 21 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 65  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Cisco currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Cisco fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Cisco shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Cisco Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Cisco have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE   Lenovo Group  LNVGY   and HP  HPQ   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Cisco  Still  the fundamentals for Cisco are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-csco-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200431003,200431003

In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 11 
Here are five of the 11 stocks 
HP Inc     NYSE HPQ     The company is the surviving entity following the November 2015 split of Hewlett Packard Company into publicly traded entities   Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and HP Inc  It hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 39    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

205235,426751,HPQ,Why Is HP  HPQ  Down 3 7  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for HP  HPQ   Shares have lost about 3 7  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is HP due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  HP Reports Q1 ResultsHP first quarter fiscal 2019 non GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 52 cents per share are in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  the metric improved 8  on a year over year basis HP s total revenues of  14 7 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 1 billion  but inched up 1  year over year  Weaker than expected sales in both its personal systems and printing businesses were dampeners Management alleged rising macro uncertainties and price sensitivity among customers to be undermining the company s high margin Printing business  Change in customer purchasing behavior with more commercial customers buying items online  negatively impacted HP s Supplies share  Further  given the high inventory and pricing issues  the company expects sales for the Printing segment to decline over the rest of the year Moreover  Intel s CPU shortages are likely to persist through the first half of 2019  Adverse currency volatility is another headwind to the company Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues  65 6  of total  of  9 7 billion  up 2 3  year over year  Industry wide supply constraints and a tough year over year comparison were overhangs Consumer and Commercial revenues increased 1  and 3  year over year  respectively HP s total unit sales fell 3  with Notebooks registering a 1  dip and Desktop units  down 8   However  revenues from Notebooks and workstations grew 5 8  and 5 5   respectively  while that of Desktops slid 3 3  Coming to the Printing business  the segment s revenues  34 4   were down 0 4  year over year to  5 1 billion  While growth in hardware revenues  increase in unit share and progress in contractual offering were a positive  the same was offset by disappointing total Supplies revenues  which affected the Printing business HP s total hardware unit sales augmented 3   backed by a 2  Consumer hardware unit s rise and the Commercial hardware unit s year over year growth of 4   Commercial Hardware revenues rose 5  while revenues from Consumer Hardware reflected 2  growth Meanwhile  Supplies revenues declined 3  to  3 3 billion  driven primarily by EMEA where it fell 9   The company witnessed a slowdown in sell through from Tier 1 to Tier 2 channels during the reported quarter On the earnings call  management further highlighted that all commercial customers are purchasing supplies online and the company has a lower market share in that space as compared to its share of traditional commercial resellers and in store retailers  Further  intensifying macro uncertainty and price sensitivity among customers have put pressure on both its share and Supplies pricing Region wise  at constant currency  revenues from Americas were down 2   While the same from Europe  the Middle East and Africa  EMEA  climbed 2  and from the Asia Pacific and Japan region  improved 11  year over year MarginsGross margin of 17 8  is flat on a year over year basis Non GAAP operating expenses rose 1  year over year to  1 6 billion due to increase in SG A expenses Non GAAP operating margin from continuing operations of 7 1  has been flat year over year Segment wise  operating margin of Personal Systems was 4 2   which expanded 70 basis points  bps   backed by better pricing and mix  partially offset by higher costs and currencies Operating margins for Printing increased 50 bps to 16 2   driven by expense management  which was partially countered by unfavorable gross margins Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  3 4 billion compared with  5 2 billion in the previous quarter  The company had long term debt of  4 7 million  up from  4 5 billion in the last reported quarter The company generated cash flow of  900 million from operational activities and  700 million free cash flow during the quarter under review HP returned nearly  1 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases   720 million  and cash dividends   249 million  OutlookHP is looking to reduce Tier 1 channel inventory in order to lower the inventory in the entire ecosystem  This is likely to create a nearly  100 million headwind to Supplies revenues for the rest of fiscal 2019  The company expects this impact coupled with the  lower go forward Supplies share and pricing assumptions  to cause a 3  fall in Supplies revenues for the current fiscal year  Earlier  the company predicted that in the Printing business  the overall Supplies revenues will be flat to slightly up for the full year Further  CPU supply constraints will likely remain an overhang on Personal Systems during the first half of 2019   However  the company projects CPU shortages to show improvements during the second half as well as the cost from the overall basket of Components and Logistics is anticipated to improve compared with the levels in the fiscal first quarter For the fiscal second quarter  HP predicts non GAAP earnings between 50 and 53 cents For fiscal 2019  HP maintains non GAAP earnings estimate between  2 12 and  2 22

205241,426757,HPQ,HP  HPQ  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"HP  HPQ  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This personal computer and printer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 3  
Revenues are expected to be  15 05 billion  up 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for HP 
For HP  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HP will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that HP would post earnings of  0 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 54  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
HP doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hp-hpq-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200390214,200390214

205256,426772,HPQ,HP  HPQ  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when HP  HPQ  reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 29  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This personal computer and printer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 54 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 7  
Revenues are expected to be  15 22 billion  up 9 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for HP 
For HP  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HP will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that HP would post earnings of  0 50 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 52  delivering a surprise of  4  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
HP doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hp-hpq-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200361819,200361819

HP shares have added about 11 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 6  
What s Next for HP 
While HP has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for HP was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

205358,426874,HPQ,HPQ HP Inc Earnings Report And Price Analysis For 08 23 17,opinion,"According to Nasdaq com  NYSE HP Inc  NYSE HPQ  is expected to report earnings on 08 23 2017 after market close  The report will be for the fiscal Quarter ending Jul 2017  According to Zacks Investment Research  based on 6 analysts  forecasts  the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is  0 42  The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was  0 48  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 6   Notably  the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and came in line once  over the trailing four quarters  It has an average positive earnings surprise of 3  
Few Words about NYSE HPQ  HP Inc   also known as Hewlett Packard  is an American technology company leading as a global provider in computing and imaging solutions and services for business and home  The company is focused on capitalizing on the opportunities of the Internet and the proliferation of electronic services  Its major businesses include Imaging and Printing Systems  Computing Systems and Information Technology Services  HPQ was formed on November 1  2015 out of the personal computer and printer divisions of the original Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ   with its enterprise products and services businesses becoming Hewlett Packard Enterprise  The split was structured so that Hewlett Packard changed its name to HP Inc  and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company  HP Inc  retains Hewlett Packard s pre 2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol  HPQ  while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol  HPE 
Regarding the coming earnings  Zacks com model does not support that HP will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release due to that fact that Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is currently pegged at 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 42 cents comes in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  One more reason for the above assumption is that HP carries a Zacks Rank  2  Though this increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Despite that  many analyst hold Bullish HPQ due to the following reasons 


HP is the leader in Printing Company World Wide especially after September 12  2016 announcement that Hewlett Packard NYSE HPQ set to buy Samsung  KS 005930  Electronics  OTC SSNLF printer business for a cash payment of  1 05 billion  The acquisition is expected to close in 2017 and is expected to be accretive in the first full year following closing  After closing  Samsung has agreed to make a  100 million to  300 million equity investment in HP through open market purchases 
Numerous Studies surfing the internet indicating by various Price Valuation Models  HPQ Stock price still remains relatively undervalued 

When it comes to our view relating to NYSE HPQ  in the weekly time frame we remain overall Bullish the Stock  At this stage we would like to see a break above the multi year descending trend line around the 20 s and from there expect price to extend to the 22 s   25 s area to reach the equal legs   1 236  extension from the 11 19 2012 cycle s lows at 5 16 before price could see sellers and correct lower  Note  HPQ can see a continuation in the pull back towards the supporting trendline around the level of 17 80 s before extend higher or see at least a 3 wave bounce against the highs at 19 60 s

HP stock is beating the market  and it reports earnings next week  But does that make it a good buy today  To answer this question  we ve turned to the Investment U Stock Grader  Our Research Team built this system to diagnose the financial health of a company 
Our system looks at six key metrics   
  Earnings per Share   EPS  Growth  HP reported a recent EPS growth rate of  13 16   That s below the technology hardware industry average of 82 46   That s not a good sign  We like to see companies that have higher earnings growth 
  Price to Earnings   P E   The average price to earnings ratio of the technology hardware industry is 27 75  And HP s ratio comes in at 13 33  It s trading at a better value than many of its competitors 
  Debt to Equity   The debt to equity ratio for HP stock cannot be calculated  That s not good 
  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   HP s FCF has been higher than that of its competitors over the last year  That s good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors 
  Profit Margins   The profit margin of HP comes in at 4 51  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this margin above that of its competitors  HP s profit margin is below the technology hardware average of 9 86   So that s a negative indicator for investors 
  Return on Equity   Return on equity gives us a look at the amount of net income returned to shareholders  The ROE for HP is  58 54   and that s below its industry average ROE of 7 94  
HP stock passes two of our six key metrics today  That s why our Investment U Stock Grader rates it as a Hold With Caution ",2017-08-17,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-hp-stock-is-rated-a-hold-with-caution-before-earnings-200207720,200207720

Since February  HP Inc  HPQ  has been in an uptrend  In fact it has risen in a channel  The low in early February was a great entry point in hindsight  But if you missed that it gave you another chance in June  The bounce off of the Brexit low had a quick pop and then a prolonged  continued run higher  That lasted until the beginning of October  when it started lower quickly  But now may be your third chance to get involved 

After touching the rising trend support line a week ago it has started to turn higher  The RSI has also turned up and is quickly approaching the mid line  The MACD is also about to cross up  This is when you want to buy stocks in a boring market  after a pullback and as they start to turn higher

This agreement follows a distributed manufacturing collaboration formed by SAP and UPS  The partnership involves integration of SAP solutions for the extended supply chain and Internet of Things with the UPS additive manufacturing and logistics network 
SAP has taken both initiatives in an effort to expand the number of co innovation partners working to assess  validate  and improve upon methods to optimize supply chain production and management

SAP Distributed Manufacturing can unlock unique opportunities to transform design  manufacturing  logistics processes and business models 
SAP AG ADR Price and Consensus
   Major 3D printing players have been diligently stepping up their efforts to carve a niche in the industrial market  This follows the gradual shift of the 3D printing industry toward the production of end use products for industrial clients  in the face of weak demand from the consumer business 
However  the transition of 3D printing  from prototyping to manufacturing  will require integration with business IT systems  In an effort to optimize efficiency and technology adoption through end to end integration  HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   is joining the SAP co innovation program 
We believe that SAP s initiative and efforts of other innovators in the alliance will help 3D printing move into mainstream manufacturing and streamline supply chains very soon

205491,427007,HPQ,Hewlett Packard Falls  But Should Rise Soon,opinion,"Back in 2014  on November 19th  we published  Is Hewlett Packard Strong Enough    We thought it was not  The only reason for our bearishness was the wave structure on the weekly chart of the stock  It could easily be counted as a five wave impulse  See it below 
According to the Elliott Wave Principle  every impulse is followed by a correction in the opposite direction  That is why we wrote that  investors could be very disappointed  if they buy  when Hewlett Packard makes a new high  in wave 5  Now  more than nine months later  let s see how Hewlett Packard  NYSE HPQ  has been developing since the forecast 
 As expected  the stock reached a new high of 41 08  What followed  was a total disappointment  On the so called  Black Monday   Hewlett Packard fell as low as 24 84  That is how the Wave principle helps analysts predict major reversals  All you need is a chart 
What now  Well  it looks like the updated chart shows a nice 5 3 wave cycle  As the theory postulates  we should now prepare for the resumption of the larger uptrend  If this is the correct count  Hewlett Packard stock prices should start rising soon  The bulls might even take the stock above 41 08 in the long term ",2015-08-26,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/we-warned-you-about-hewlett-packard-263033,263033
205492,427008,HPQ,Follow The Leaders  Learning From ETFs  BCA And The New PM,opinion,"Last Thursday I had the pleasure of attending an intensive daylong ETF conference in Austin  just up the road from our office in San Antonio  Hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald  the conference was designed for institutional investors 
Welcoming the group was Reginald  Reggie  Browne  the  Godfather of ETFs   who now serves as the senior managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald  His celebrity and prominence are nearly as big as his six foot five frame and with good reason  Reggie has been instrumental in building the ETF landscape over the last decade and convincing investors of the power of the exchange traded fund 
One of the panels featured chief investment officers from the Texas Teacher Retirement System  TRS   Jase Auby  Lee Partridge and Tom Tull discussed potential shifts in asset allocation under a rising interest rate environment  among other topics 
The TRS  one of the largest pension funds in the U S   makes significant use of gold in its investment strategy  holding the yellow metal in many forms over the years  The same is true for the  20 billion University of Texas endowment fund 
Bruce Zimmerman  chief investment officer for UTIMCO  told CNBC in 2011 that the  20 billion endowment holds gold as a diversifier and hedge against currencies  This is precisely what we tell investors  and it s validating to see such huge funds put it in practice 
During the ETF panel  I asked Jase  Lee  Tom and moderator Ronnie Jung about their thoughts on real interest rates and their relationship with gold  Everyone s speculating on when the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates  but real interest rates  as I shared with you this week  appear to have already risen   As a reminder  real interest rates are what you get when you deduct the monthly rate of inflation from the 10 year Treasury yield   A 10 percent upswing in the U S  dollar is equivalent to the federal funds rate being hiked 100 basis points 
This has had a huge effect on the yellow metal  When real rates are negative  gold has tended to do well  Conversely  when they re positive and rising  as they are now it s been a headwind for gold  This relationship was confirmed by the research of Barry Bannister  chief equity strategist for Stifel  who visited our office last week 
I also appreciated the TRS group s bullishness on China  Their position is that  because everyone is negative on China right now  all sorts of investment opportunities open up from a contrarian point of view 
The World s Second Largest Economy in Flux I ve commented before that China has been moving away from a manufacturing based economy and instead focusing more on services financials  real estate  insurance  ecommerce and the like 

While the country s purchasing managers  index  PMI  reading has been in contraction mode since March of this year  these service industries are ever expanding  The problem is that the transformation has not been fast enough to offset the massive size of the manufacturing sector 
But investment opportunities in this sector still exist  Anyone who s traveled more than 100 miles inland knows that China is under urbanized  Ever since Deng Xiaoping created special tax free zones along the eastern Chinese coastline in 1978  most of the country s growth has been concentrated in these few regions and municipalities  The interior provinces  on the other hand  have remained largely rural 
You can see this for yourself in the chart below  provided by Marko Papic  chief geopolitical strategist for BCA Research  who briefed our investments team this week  BCA is an influential  independent investment strategy firm with more than 65 years of experience conducting excellent macroeconomic research 

We just learned that the People s Bank of China cut both lending and saving rates 0 25 percent  to 4 35 percent and 1 50 percent respectively  This will cause negative real rates in China to fall even lower  which is good for gold demand 
It will also likely add to the Fed s list of doubts about raising its own rates  In a world where every other major country is stimulating its economy by cutting rates and devaluing its currency  it makes less and less sense for the U S  to hike rates 
BCA s Marko Papic stressed the need to see further stimulus in China  Without it  commodities and global growth in general are at risk  Some economists believe we might be headed for a global recession 
Difference of Opinion When It Comes to Defining Global Recession Depending on who you ask  there are different ideas of what global recession looks like  The generally accepted one in the U S  is two consecutive quarterly declines in real GDP  The International Monetary Fund  IMF   however  uses a different measure  Among other economic conditions  annual GDP must fall below 3 percent  a high benchmark and one that requires much stimulus 
Global growth for 2015 is at 3 3 percent  the IMF calculates  precariously close to the 3 percent threshold 
BCA Research  The Trans Pacific Partnership Is Needed to Fast Track Global Growth This is where the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  comes into play  which is the stance BCA also takes  The landmark trade agreement  involving 12 nations  was signed earlier this month  Although it still requires ratification  the TPP could boost the world economy by an incredible  223 billion by 2025  according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics 

Like Father  Like Son  Canada Elects a New Leader

One of the TPP s biggest supporters was outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper  But the newly elected Justin Trudeau  member of the Liberal party  has also come out in support of free trade agreements  The hope is that he will continue to take this position where the TPP is concerned 
Although Trudeau earned his degree in education from the University of British Columbia and taught as a school teacher for many years  he is by no means a stranger to politics  He s served as a Member of Parliament since 2008  and his father  Pierre Trudeau  served as Canada s prime minister for 15 years 
Back in the 1970s  in fact  I campaigned for Pierre Trudeau alongside Dr  John Evans  a Rhodes Scholar  This was during Trudeau s first stint in office  before being voted out in 1979 and then returning to serve again in 1984 
His son  only 43  ran on a campaign of hope and change sound familiar  and promised that  if elected  he would help the economy by increasing infrastructure spending  Unlike some other world leaders  he wants to put people to work instead of establishing a welfare state  Trudeau plans to raise revenue by taxing recreational marijuana if he succeeds at legalizing it  that is 
One of the main criticisms of Trudeau the Younger is that he s inexperienced politically  But here in the U S   take a look at who s currently topping the polls in the Republican field  business magnate Donald Trump  neurosurgeon Dr  Ben Carson and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina  Accomplished though they are  none of them has been elected to office  This goes to show that voters have grown fed up with career politicians who lack accountability

205500,427016,HPQ,Hewlett Packard Company  All Eyes On Company Split,opinion,"Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  released second quarter earnings for fiscal year 2015 on May 21  beating the estimate for earnings per share but narrowly missing revenue expectations  The top analyst consensus for the stock was a Moderate Buy before earnings  but now the consensus has turned to Hold 
Aside from figures in the earnings report  analysts were listening for an update from HPQ regarding the company split  By November  Hewlett Packard will split into HP Inc   which will encompass the computing and printing business  and Hewlett Packard Enterprise  which will include the computing segments such as software  storage  and cloud technology  Each will be an independent and publicly traded company Many analysts were concerned about the high cost of splitting the company  but HPQ announced that the cost of  dis synergies  is approximately  400 million to  450 million  CEO Meg Whitman commented in the conference call with investors that most of the costs should be offset in fiscal year 2016  and more than fully offset by fiscal year 2017 
Hewlett Packard posted earnings per share of  0 87 on a non GAAP diluted basis  beating the analyst consensus by one cent  though marking a 1  year over year decrease  The company posted  24 45 billion in net revenue  missing the analyst consensus of  25 68 billion by a narrow margin and marking a 7  year over year decrease  Revenue derived from the Personal Systems segment decreased 5  from the same quarter last year while revenue from the Printing segment decreased 7  year over year  The two segments combined made up more than half of HPQ s total revenue 
Looking forward  Hewlett Packard expects to post 3Q15 non GAAP diluted earnings per share between  0 83 and  0 87  For the full year 2015  HPQ expects to post non GAAP diluted EPS between  3 53 and  3 73 
On May 22   of Citigroup reiterated a Buy rating on Hewlett Packard with a  41 price target  
Suva noted that HPQ s second quarter earnings were  solid   especially after accounting for foreign exchange headwinds  Suva noted that the Hewlett Packard s estimated cost of splitting the company was lower than his initial estimate of  500 million to  1 billion  He concluded   Overall  we believe the risk of a large dis synergy cost was the last major overhang that needed to be resolved before investors became comfortable owning HPQ shares into the break up in November  
Jim Suva has a 52  overall success rate recommending stocks with a  4 5  average return per rating 
Separately on May 22   of BMO Capital reiterated a Market Perform rating on HPQ but lowered his price target from  42 to  38  Bachman highlighted that HPQ has  consistently underperformed its own expectations targets and market growth opportunities  for the last 10 quarters  In order for HPQ to continue to  grow its top line  as it restructures  Bachman believes the company needs to  lower its cost  including increasing its offshore mix  and invest to add to skill sets and capabilities in growth areas such as cloud and analytics   The analyst concluded   Our point is that we don t think HP can simply cut cost to create a compelling services organization  Keith Bachman has a 72  overall success rate recommending stocks with a  25 9  average return per rating ",2015-05-25,Sarah Roden,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hewlett-packard-company-(hpq):-all-eyes-on-company-split-252834,252834
205507,427023,HPQ,Put A Collar On Hewlett Packard Stock  Not Your Cat,opinion,"Some things look great with a collar on them  Maybe not your cat though  But a collar for protecting a stock position can look fantastic 
Last week I wrote about the Cup and Handle pattern in Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ   And if you bought Hewlett Packard based on that idea  or were lucky enough to pick it up at the bottom on October 15th  you are now sitting with a position  and possibly a good sized gain into the earnings report tonight  So now what do you do  Pull out that collar 

Heading into earnings  Hewlett Packard  is testing resistance at 38  The chart continues to point higher  but anything can happen when they report  The options market shows very large open interest at the 37 strike this week  which could easily hold it in place  And the at the money straddles show traders expect a  1 60 move by Friday  just not what direction  There are sizeable block at 36 and 35 lower should it pullback  And activity ahead of earnings sees interest in the 38 50 calls 
The chart itself shows shows some support at 34 50 almost 10  below  and resistance possibly next at 40  The momentum indicators also point higher  That leaves plenty of room against the straddle range of about 36 to 40 
Adding a November 38 36 Put Spread December 12 Expiry 40 Call Collar can give protection and continue to offer upside price participation  This is buying a November 38 36 Put Spread  about 65 cents  and selling a December 12 Expiry 40 Strike Covered Call  about 30 cents   The net cost is about 1  of the stock to protect over 55 downside protection this week  and still allow 5  upside participation without any adjustments

205508,427024,HPQ,Hewlett Packard Posts Light Revenues,opinion,"Tech giant Hewlett Packard  NYSE HPQ  posted fiscal Q4 and full fiscal 2014 earnings after the bell Tuesday  While earnings per share of  1 06 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  revenues of  28 4 billion in the quarter missed our expectations of roughly  28 9 billion  Shares had slipped about 3  in immediate after market trading  but have since subsided to down about 1 5

Fundamentals aside  the big news about HP came earlier when the company announced it will be split into two entities  HP Enterprise and HP  Inc  CEO Meg Whitman will retain Chairwoman status of both boards  but Whitman will continue as CEO of HP Enterprise  The key questions for this group will be how HP manages to monetize its services on the Enterprise side    whether by acquisitions or partnerships with other firms in the cloud space  etc 
Hewlett Packard gave higher guidance for full fiscal 2015 than the Zacks consensus  the company expects earnings between  3 83  4 03  whereas we had been expecting  3 73  Upward analyst revisions should pick up Hewlett Packard s Zacks Rank in the coming days  HP currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the first full week of June sees the Equity markets had a good week but may need a pause or pullback before continuing  as they are overbought on some measures  Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with a downward bias while Crude Oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US Dollar Index seems content to move sideways on the long term consolidation but with a short term upward bias while US Treasuries are biased lower in the short term  The Shanghai Composite looks to be stuck in a rut  moving sideways  and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  despite the moves higher  although the VIX is near historic lows  The Equity Index charts themselves all look good for more upside  but are becoming overbought on the shorter timeframe  On the weekly charts they look strong  so perhaps some sideways or a pullback before more upside  Of course they can just keep rising and get more overbought short term  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

205524,427040,HPQ,Gold In Neverland  Silver In A Funk,opinion,"No  not on James Barrie s fictional isle of residency for Tinker Bell and Peter Pan  Rather  Gold is in the Neverland of price  which for all good intentions  and perhaps otherwise  never goes anywhere anymore  In 26 of the last 28 trading days  better than a month   Gold has traded in the 1290s  As we detailed a week ago  price to be probably consolidating rather than falling is one thing  but to become like the plane of a proper slate billiard table is quite another  The latter having become the case  it renders many a technical measure useless  Certainly at our shack  the incoming email is rife over that condition becoming more visible 
 My moving averages are all on top of one another  sums it up quite succinctly   Tis what occurs under extended periods of price consolidation  Those of you who read the daily Prescient Commentary saw on Tuesday that 

   Gold  1291 2  fired off no less than eight buy signals in yesterday s Market Rhythms data run for each of the 4 6 8 12 hour time frames on both the MACD and Price Oscillator studies  suggestive of a return up into the 1300s by week s end   

Which in fact happened  Price then slipping yet again to closed out the week in the vaunted 1290s  But specific to the eight buy signals which at first blush seemed impressive   tis this narrow whippiness of late in Gold s price which has turned such technical indications into feeble  if not failing  forecasts 
Moreover  in thinking back to similar price inaction  round the upper 1500s gliding into the Summer of 2012  thereby creating the now somewhat infamous Top of The Floor at 1579   after which price leapt well over 200 points to 1799   I m again likening this current 2014 consolidation to being more compellingly convergent than the confluence of the Allegheny  Monongahela  and Ohio Rivers  to which one writee then further responded  Or the Atchison  Topeka  and Santa Fe    a little StateSide railroad lore there   But  compellingly  so in that the flatness will inevitably break out one way or the other  my thinking of course being to the upside  whilst many an analyst think to the downside  Try for example this quote   name withheld   per one of our favourite news services 
 There are really no fundamental reasons to be invested in gold     The safe haven premium has dropped because the economy is improving   Just when you thought you d heard it all  eh  Wow  To go on record with such rationale takes what the Greeks call thrasos  If that s not the Anti Gold Story then we ll never know what is  Then from another interviewee came this quote   Right now  we are in the direction of directionless     The market will break out from this very narrow trading range  and given the general performance     I bet on the downside  
If Gold has already been essentially sold in toto by those entities desiring to so do  to therefore further sell entails going Short   meaning later being forced to buy and  post first notice  even obliged to make delivery    which is  physical     but Gold is readily available  right    In any event  the market mechanism is fortunate to have such folks as these to take the other side of the trade  Exactly right 
The one thing upon which we presently do agree is the mathematic reality of  flat   Now with eight weeks of recorded parabolic Short trend in the books  given that such trend originally commenced at 1286  the settle for every one of those weeks including Friday s 1293 level has been above that initial price 
 Hey mmb  it s kinda like  What if they gave a parabolic short trend  but nobody went down   huh  
An intellectual analogy there  Squire  but to be sure  the red dots themselves continue to descend  and better that their path is not steep  indicative of price not actually falling 

Part and parcel of the Gold price consolidation is just how narrow the  expected daily trading range   EDTR  has become   Tis no wonder we can hardly escape the 1290s  The following graphic from a year ago to date of Gold s EDTR shows it as having diminished to a low of merely 14 7 points per day   i e  that daily factor is the expected distance between the high and low for each subsequent trading session  

Indeed if the above chart is telling us that Gold has been left for naught   tis to the negative nabobs  chagrin  for upon the next rocket shot  the bulls shall be in  but the nabobs not   Much later upon their capitulating to buy  we ll of course welcome them  as well we ought  
For the present however  it remains all about the 1290s  so much so that The Gold Update may have to officially credit this annoying level with its own moniker  which given recent correspondence  ought be  The Whiny 1290s   The following Market Profile for Gold s 10 most recent trading days   if not for an entire month   would support such sobriquet 

From a historical perspective  Gold first traded above 1290 on 21 September 2010 at a time when price was rightly rising in concert with the outpouring of faux dough by sovereign bank entities  round the globe  StateSide alone  our M2 on that day was measured at  8 7 trillion  today  tis  11 3 trillion  an increase of  29 9   Applying that increase to Gold s 1290 level puts it at 1676  Just in case yer scorin  at home  The Whiny 1290s indeed 
Of course  tisn t just Gold that s gone to ground  Sister Silver has gone into a clearly worse funk  As we turn to her daily bars for the last three months  the baby blue dots that measure the consistency of price s 21 day linear regression trend have completely flat lined smack on the 0  horizontal axis  I do not recall ever before having noted such a condition in any of the markets that comprise BEGOS  Bond  Euro Swiss  Gold Silver Copper  Oil  S P    Doctor  I fear the patient is dead    

How many weeks has it been since we remarked that soon we d not be in Kansas anymore   4   Were we in France  I d understand having not gone anywhere  given the relatively endless instances of railway strikes as an expected part of life  Or  one might with tongue in cheek state that Gold and Silver actually have gone somewhere  on sabbatical to Neverland 
 But mmb  it s all about the S P man  1900  
Yes  Squire  the S P 500 closed for the first time ever above 1900 on Friday  Big whoop   twas on the weakest S P futures volume day in a full three weeks   and the fourth such weakest since June took over the contract volume back in March   What was it that fellow Confucius remarked   Man riding stock on low volume in market is destined to riding stock on no money in circus   Or something like that  I doubt the FinMedia reported as well that the price earnings ratio if honestly calculated closed Friday over 30x for the Index  itself up a comparatively meager  2 8  year to date   Gold being  7 3  and the Bond  7 0      hint hint  nudge nudge  elbow elbow  
Still  the Economic Barometer as posted Friday is seemingly supportive of market direction   

   unless  tis topping  Something to track toward 18 June   the next episode of Fed Follies   Oh look  Hewlett Packard  NYSE HPQ  announced Thursday that it plans to cut up to 16 000 more jobs by October  And what s that  The fashion chain Fat Face has pulled its IPO plans  Say it ain t so   As a precursor to the ensuing week  you might grab an economic calendar and run your eye down the consensus vs  prior period data  practically every item is expected to have weakened  including a revision of Q1 GDP s  0 1  growth to a  0 5  contraction  Have a nice day  
Either way  whilst Janet s Federal Open Market Committee  barring a Baro debacle  is expected next month to continue its withdraw of stimulus  Mario s Governing Council at the ECB is given a 90  chance by economists to instead increase stimulus in June  especially given that German business confidence declined more than expected in May  suggestive of Europe s largest economy slowing down after a robust start to the year  Out of the  uro and into the dollar  Again  say it ain t so  But it hasn t fazed Gold a wit  else  twould be sub The Whiny 1290s  non  And is my selfishly rooting for an 80   uro motivating me to sell Gold   Course not  for as we oft say  at the end of the day  Gold plays no bow wow currency favourites  And not that veteran readers need be reminded  but the proof is in the pudding  to again wit the first half of 2010 as a favourite example 

Gold shan t remain in Kansas  nor Neverland for that matter  in perpetuity  A breakout is nigh  indeed perhaps a dual breakout wherein consensus expects a lemming led still higher S P  which remaining in negative correlation to Gold means the latter sinks  Both markets are already at fundamentally flawed excesses   Gold low  S P high   such that their foundational elasticities are under duress of full stretch  similar to your exercise bands which  when they suddenly snap  the reaction is an in your face shock  The term  summer doldrums  may well be oxymoronic in 2014

205560,427076,HPQ,Hewlett Packard Bonds Offer Value Amid Headwinds,opinion,Since Hewlett Packard  HPQ  CEO Meg Whitman provided earnings guidance for 2013 in early October  investors with disappointment on their minds have targeted and attacked anything related to the company  The stock has tumbled by a staggering 22 8 percent from October 2 through yesterday  Similarly  yields on HPQ bonds have increased in a time where U S  Treasury rates have either stayed the same or for longer maturities  have fallen  While the announcement is upsetting for stockholders  the fact is that the outlook should be sufficiently constructive from a credit perspective  In particular  management s goal of improving the company s credit profile via debt reduction should be a strong positive for bond holders  The company hopes to return to a mid single A credit rating from its current low A3 BBB  rating by Moody s S P  Watch Negative by Moody s  over the course of the next several years  Furthermore and despite the competitive challenges the company faces across all of its business segments  the credit fundamentals suggest that HPQ bonds are cheap and are a relative value opportunity  especially when compared with debt issued by other Technology companies of similar investment grade ratings  On October 3  2012 at HPQ s turnaround strategy meeting with security analysts  CFO Cathie Lesjak provided the outlook of the company for 2013  While the company provided non GAAP earnings per share guidance in the range of  3 40 to  3 60 which fell short of the average analyst s expectations of just above  4 00 per share  the management team stressed its priority of debt reduction and repairing its balance sheet in the next several years  The hope is to ultimately reduce its cost of capital by improving its credit rating one notch  In particular  Lesjak said at the  Now  I ve highlighted the importance of rebuilding the balance sheet  Let s look at the progress we ve made  You can see that over the last several years we ve utilized our free cash flow largely for M A and share repurchases  This has driven our net debt position down below where a mid single A credit rated company would be  As I mentioned  we have made progress this year by reducing operating company net debt positions by over  2 5 billion  but we have more work to do  and we expect it could take a couple more years before we are where we need to be  That said  it remains to be seen if they continue down this path of paying down its debt  However  the fact is that this is a priority for management and is vital for the company s turnaround  Any expected declines in earnings in 2013 should be offset by any significant debt reductions  This in turn should be good for bond investors  Another thing to consider is the credit profile of HPQ on a relative basis  From a fundamental standpoint  HPQ has better credit metrics in comparison with another technology investment grade company  Xerox Corporation  XRX  which is rated lower at Baa2 BBB   The amount of net debt relative to its profitability ratio for HPQ is better than XRX  The Net Debt to EBITDA ratio which is represented as a multiple  measures how easily debt can be repaid using a company s cash flow  EBITDA which stands for Earnings Before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation  and Amortization  is one measure of profitability  An easy way to interpret this ratio is to say that a company that has a ratio of  2x  would mean that it would take two years  worth of cash flow to repay its debt  So  a lower multiple is better  In the case of HPQ  the company has a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 48x while XRX is at 2 81x when using earnings over the past 12 months  Along the same lines  HPQ has a lower debt burden in relation to its size than XRX  HPQ sports a Net Debt as a percentage of Shareholder Equity of 63 2  versus 66 6  from XRX  Given these credit metrics  it is easy to assume that XRX bonds would trade at a higher yield than HPQ  However  that is not the case which provides investors a relative value opportunity in terms of yield  HPQ bonds are trading at a higher yield to XRX bonds with similar characteristics  According to   HPQ 4 65  Coupon Maturing on December 9  2021  CUSIP 428236BV4  is currently trading at a dollar price of  99 67 which translates to a yield to maturity of 4 69   Comparatively  XRX 4 50  Coupon Maturing on May 15  2021  CUSIP 984121CD3  can be purchased at a dollar price of  106 14 which equates to a yield of 3 65   So by investing in HPQ  an investor can pick up an additional 104 basis points based off of today s levels while assuming similar risks  For investors who do not want to take on that much interest rate risk by extending with a longer maturity but would like to capture some carry  the short end of the yield curve provides some opportunities  An investor can capture 3 16  on a yield to maturity basis by owning HPQ 2 60  Coupon Maturing on September 15  2017  CUSIP 428236BW2  at a dollar price of  97 52  This is a 101 basis point pickup over XRX 2 95  Coupon Maturing on March 15  2017  CUSIP 984121CF8  which at a  103 29 dollar price is yielding 2 15   All of the aforementioned bonds were highlighted by finding the best yield given the dollar price  Some bonds yielded higher but at a cost of a higher dollar premium  Furthermore  keep in mind that corporate bonds trade over the counter  So  prices and yields can vary depending on the broker you use  The best suggestion is to use a broker that offers the most visibility and price transparency for the corporate bond market  This can be achieved by comparing the price to buy and the sale price  aka bid ask spread   The closer the differential usually means the better the liquidity  As always

205561,427077,HPQ,FTSE Manages To Breach Positive Territory Near Close,opinion,Heading into the close on Tuesday  the FTSE managed to push into positive territory  up ten points  having managed to consolidate its position after Monday s big upward move The markets have been able to weather everything thrown at them  stubbornly holding on to the gains made Monday on hopes of progress in US fiscal cliff negotiations  Monday night s downgrade of France by Moody s has been ignored with an appropriately Gallic shrug  since it doesn t exactly spell doom for the French economy  I suspect Paris is still too busy seething over that Economist story to get too worked up about Moody s  Meanwhile the afternoon got off to an exciting start after Hewlett Packard announced a massive write down on the value of its Autonomy acquisition  Although HP avoided using the word  fraud   its use of  wilful effort to mislead  suggests that they are definitely not happy  A fresh drop in sales for HP rubs salt in the wound  but underscores the point that HP s problems do not end with the Autonomy investigation Ben Bernanke makes a speech this evening and although he has no power to directly influence the fiscal cliff  expect him to make some appropriately dire predictions about what might happen if a deal is not struck  This might disperse some of the positive atmosphere that is still evident in global markets but the bulls do not appear to have lost control just yet ,2012-11-20,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ftse-manages-to-breach-positive-territory-near-close-144422,144422

205592,427108,HPQ,Market Outlook  Risk On Thursday,opinion,CiscoWell  miracles do still happen  that dog of a stock for the last  too long to count  actually beat for the quarter  Yes  I am talking about Cisco  CSCO   Cisco quarterly reports often send the market down 200 points  they have woefully underperformed the market by a large margin  However  not only did Cisco have a good quarter in this environment  but yesterday they raised their dividend by 75   Can you say short squeeze later today  If all goes well in the conference call with reasonable guidance  and given the preview on CNBC  expect a big Risk On day today for equities In fact  because we are right up against resistance in several markets such as Oil  Bonds and the S P  the volume should finally pick up and some key resistance levels could get blown through on Thursday  Cisco is one of those bellwether stocks that either lifts or plunges the rest of the market  expect a nice pop at the opening as shorts are pushed a little outside their comfort zones today The next question is whether today s potential rally  if it does play out as I anticipate  will be a rally that can finish the day on the highs or is a prime candidate for the fade team to come in at the highs and sell into with gusto  But hey one miracle at a time  What s next  Hewlett Packard  HPQ  beating and having a good quarter as well  That s probably too much to ask for  but if they do  the shorts could get a much higher entry point Oil Markets Other things to watch out for today are if Crude Oil can take the next leg up after a bullish inventory report  If WTI breaks above  95 on Thursday then the  100 level is in play again with that range being from  92 to  99 70  Remember that range  Gas prices have been going up  not sure who is buying all this gas  but inventories are starting to get stretched  My first impression is that the US is now exporting more gas than previously as an arbitrage play with cheaper WTI versus Brent being attractive for exports in the southern region of the US  But whatever the case  whether Iran Oil has really been off the grey market  it cannot be denied that US refineries are running like crazy and we have lopped 20 million barrels off the Oil inventory picture in short fashion So watch Crude Oil  as Brent is already moving towards pricing in an Iranian escalation of tensions and seems headed towards  120 a barrel relatively quickly  Some trial balloons in the media seem to be taking hold coming out of Israel  stay tuned to this circus show as it could get quite scary and provide some interesting election fodder for the candidates  BondsThe 10 year is bumping up against the 1 8  area  let s watch today for some continuation of this move with traders getting pushed to some extent  Does a big move today push some safe haven capital into riskier assets on Thursday  The bond market could steal the show at the opening as that trade is so crowded I would hate to see even a glimpse of what that repositioning might look like with its derivative effect playing out for Risk Assets  All in all  we should expect much higher volumes today with some key levels tested in some pivotal markets  much better than the snooze fest of the past three days  When in doubt follow the price ,2012-08-16,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-outlook:-risk-on-thursday-133128,133128
