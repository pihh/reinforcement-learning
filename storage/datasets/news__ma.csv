189493,411009,MA,Australia central bank looks to rid Visa  Mastercard of debit payments edge,news,"By Paulina Duran SYDNEY  Reuters    Australian regulators will consider intervening to stop banks from automatically directing  tap and go  card payments through the world s largest payment processors Visa  N V  and Mastercard Inc   N MA   the central bank said on Wednesday  Banks must stop automatically directing debit card payments through the two global networks  and instead give retailers the cheaper option to use local network EFTPOS  Philip Lowe  the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA   told reporters   Regulating here is not the preferred option but it is a fallback option if we don t see the required change   he said after a speech in Sydney  Global card schemes MasterCard and Visa  alongside the major four banks  dominate card payments systems in Australia  EFTPOS is owned by domestic financial institutions and retailers  The RBA says debit card payments  Australia s most frequently used method  processed through Visa or Mastercard cost retailers more than twice as much as using EFTPOS   The retailers  association estimates this adds up to extra costs of between A 300 million and A 500 million   200 million and  340 million  each year   We have made it very clear to the banking industry that we expect them to develop the functionality to allow the merchant to choose which payment rails it goes through  the international schemes or the EFTPOS schemes   Lowe added   If that process doesn t work then we would have to consider a regulatory solution   Visa and Mastercard were not immediately available for comment  The banks had promised to develop systems to facilitate the cheaper route for retailers  Low said  adding that his preference would be not to have to intervene   The RBA is reviewing payments regulations to see what strategic issues need to be tackled  from the impact of new payment technologies and new entrants to regulatory technology and an electronic form of banknotes   One of the possible reasons for the major banks dragging their feet on least cost routing is that they each have very extensive relationships with the large international schemes   we will be exploring this in the review   Tony Richards  the head of payments policy at the RBA  was quoted as saying in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday  A spokesman from Commonwealth Bank of Australia  AX CBA  declined to comment   A spokesman for NAB said the bank started letting its merchant customers choose their payment network in April 2018  adding   We continue to roll out this service across our client base throughout this year   Westpac Banking Corp  AX WBC  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  AX ANZ  were not immediately available for comment

189494,411010,MA,Here s Why MasterCard  MA  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at MasterCard  MA   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  MasterCard currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if MA is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this processor of debit and credit card payments holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For MA  shares are up 0  over the past week while the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 28  compares favorably with the industry s 4 75  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of MasterCard have risen 18 7   and are up 57  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 8 27  and 26 25   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to MA s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  MA is currently averaging 3 616 438 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with MA 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost MA s consensus estimate  increasing from  9 05 to  9 06 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that MA is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep MasterCard on your short list ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-mastercard-ma-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200503332,200503332
189495,411011,MA,Chart Of The Day  Is Bitcoin s Recent Rally Over ,opinion,"Bitcoin has plunged around 3 75  today  taking the cryptocurrency back below the critical  10 000 level  This selloff comes after a straight five day rally of over 10  

Despite the numerous reports currently circulating about a potential digital currency  by the Fed and the ongoing interest in Facebook s  NASDAQ FB  much debated digital money initiative  Libra  the story dominating the headlines today is the growing impact of the continued spread of the deadly coronavirus 

Of course  the Fed may or may not consider creating a U S  digital currency  And Mastercard  NYSE MA   a founding member of the Libra Association  which had been toying with the idea of using Facebook s crypto initiative as its digital currency  has decided against it due to transparency concerns  

But these reports have been going back and forth for a while  yet hadn t impeded the 10  rise of the past five days  So the driver of today s slump is either still unknown or simply profit taking at a time when other haven assets are fluctuating  When so much is unclear around the fundamental drivers of an asset  technical analysis of the charts can add a bit more clarity 

The December January H S bottom s target was more than realized during the rally  The digital currency reached a round number whose psychological significance has left an impression  in the form of an obvious support resistance level  starting with the July 2 low  Later  after falling through it in September  the price turned to a resistance in October and November 
Both the MACD and the RSI demonstrate a setup for at least a corrective pullback  The MACD has attempted a third rise  which  if it fails and falls below the late January high  would be an obvious sell signal  The RSI has already provided such a call  when dipping below its recent uptrend line since mid December  from a 75 level  the most oversold since June  to boot  A fall below 54 would constitute a momentum top 
The minimum expectation is a return to retest the uptrend line since the beginning of the year  Note that as of this position  such a meeting would coincide with the price level that was a support through the end of December and beginning of January  after already acting as a resistance in mid December  There is a lot of vested interest at the  9000 levels 
Trading StrategiesConservative traders would wait for a return to the uptrend line and seek evidence for demand 
Moderate traders may wait for a pullback to buy at a better price  not waiting for a rebound that would evidence support 
Aggressive traders may short the expected pullback

189509,411025,MA,Gold Prices Drift Ahead of Fed Chairman Powell s Press Conference,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    Gold prices remained range bound on Wednesday as markets were content to wait for the press conference of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later in the day 
The Fed s two day policy meeting wraps up at 2 PM ET  19 00 GMT   and Powell will speak half an hour later  Recent U S  data   from the rise in the Conference Board s consumer confidence index to housing starts and the better than expected purchasing manager index published by IHS Markit   have suggested the U S  economy still has enough momentum not to need further stimulus 
However  markets may be more concerned about the fate of the extra liquidity that the Fed pumped into the market via repo transactions before the end of 2019  While he has denied this was a resumption of quantitative easing  the longer the liquidity stays in circulation  the more that line looks like little more than semantic nit picking 
By 11 30 AM ET  1630 GMT   gold futures for delivery on the COMEX exchange were essentially flat at  1 569 35 a troy ounce  Spot gold was up 0 3  at  1 570 15 
Silver futures were also flat at  17 43 an ounce  while platinum futures lost another 1 7  to  977 75 and palladium futures edged down to  2 184 30 an ounce  That came against a backdrop of a report from German engineering group Robert Bosch  who said that global car sales may already have peaked  Most industrial demand for platinum group metals is down to their use in catalytic convertors in internal combustion engines 
Copper futures  meanwhile  hit their lowest in nearly four months at  2 56 a pound 
Earlier  gold had fallen as low as  1 565 40 as the market zeroed in on strong earnings reports from the likes of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Mastercard  NYSE MA   However  there were also enough pockets of weakness to temper demand for risk assets  and lingering concerns about the impact of the novel coronavirus also returned to the fore as British Airway and Lufthansa cancelled all flights to China  while Toyota said it would suspend vehicle production in the country 
The World Health Organization said it would reconvene Wednesday to consider again whether to designate the outbreak a matter of global concern  So far  the death toll has reached 106  while the number of reported cases continues to grow at around 50  a day 
 The Fed set the bar high for further loosening at its last FOMC meeting in December by stating that a  material reassessment  of the outlook would be required for the Bank to consider cutting rates again   said Capital Economics analyst Simona Gambarini in a research note   So while the epidemic may get worse  we doubt that the Fed would respond unless there were a much larger and sustained drop in equity prices alongside a substantial worsening in the survey data  
Gambarini sees gold prices back at  1 400 by year end  implying more than 10  downside from the current level ",2020-01-29,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/gold-prices-drift-ahead-of-fed-chairman-powells-press-conference-2070734,2070734

Executive OfficerThank you  Warren  and good morning everybody  So we closed our 2019 on a strong note  And for the year  revenue was up 16  and EPS was up 23   on a non GAAP currency neutral basis  I think these results reflect broad based growth across each of our regions and the ongoing execution of our strategy as we continue to invest for the longer term On the macroeconomic environment  consumer spending remains relatively healthy  and we expect this to continue in 2020  We are however monitoring  a number of economic and geopolitical factors as well as the potential effects of  Technical Issues  corona virus that could impact results In the US  we are seeing stable growth with low unemployment and healthy consumer confidence  Our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4 show retail sales remained solid  up 3 1  versus the year ago ex auto  ex gas  In Europe  we see continued modest growth  UK spending actually held up reasonably well again  according to our SpendingPulse estimates with year over year retail sales up 3  Technical Issues  in Q4 ex auto  gas and restaurants despite uncertainty around the potential impact of Brexit In Asia Pacific  we are seeing modest GDP growth in the region overall  in part due to the support of favorable monetary policies in several markets  We are pleased with the recent trade deal with China  And obviously  we ll continue our efforts to pursue a license to participate in that market domestically The outlook in Latin America is mix of growth in Brazil and Colombia  partially offset by weakness in Argentina and Mexico  Meanwhile  we are driving healthy double digit volume and transaction growth for Mastercard across most of our markets and these results are a function of us growing our core products of differentiating with our unique services of expanding our digital solutions and footprint  and are leveraging our multi rail capabilities to capture new payment flows So let me start by talking about driving growth in the call  We ve done that through new wins as well as key renewals and expansions  Following on the heels of our recently announced extension with Citibank  we are excited to announce a renewal and extension of our relationship with Capital One  We also signed an agreement with software payUS to launch new debit  credit and payroll solutions for small and medium sized businesses later this year  And we renewed our deal with the Standard Bank Group in South Africa  the largest bank in Africa  which includes new issuance and will help us grow our share in that market and throughout the region On the co brand front  the Amazon Rewards Mastercard has launched in Canada  MoneyLine  a US based mobile consumer finance platform has selected Mastercard as their exclusive partner for their new credit co brand program  and we ll flip that existing consumer debit portfolio to us as well  In the travel space  we won a new co brand deal with Vistara Airlines in India  and have also expanded a long running co brand relationship  Norwegian Cruise Line in the United States Turning to prepaid  we have renewed our agreement with the network for Direct Express  which is the largest prepaid program in the world  This card issued by Comerica Bank is used by the US government to make fast  convenient and secure federal benefits disbursements  And in debit  we have expanded our presence in key emerging markets in China and India  In China  we entered a new deal to be the preferred debit partner of China Construction Bank  the second largest bank in China  And are also launching our first debit program with China CITIC Bank In India  we have maintained our debit leadership to renew debit deals with both HDFC Bank and State Bank of India  the largest public sector bank in the country  So now to differentiated services and co products wins such as these I ve just talked about frequently included  Technical Issues   We continue to grow these services both organically and inorganically  and are making good progress in this regard  And for example  Brighterion s artificial intelligence platform and new data behavioral biometric capabilities have been broadly integrated into our core security solutions to help customers minimize fraud and manage risk And so joining Mastercard  Ethoca has signed over 350 new deals including our recent agreement with Microsoft  Technical Issues  streamline their dispute process and improve the cardholder experience  And while on the topic of acquisitions  I think we have bolstered our Cyber Intelligence Suite  a step further with our recent acquisition of RiskRecon  a leading provider of AI and data analytics solutions RiskRecon s best in class Cyber Risk Assessment capabilities are designed to help financial institutions  merchants  corporations and governments secure their digital assets   Technical Issues  build on their current customer base and develop new cyber security services  We are very pleased to have the RiskRecon team as part of the Mastercard family  and we look forward to offering these solutions to our customers So on to digital initiatives and our footprint there  we are expanding our digital solutions the rollout of Click to Pay with new deals on our merchant tokenization solution and real progress on the Contactless front  On Click to Pay  we can announce that merchants such as Fresh Product   Technical Issues  and Saks Fifth Avenue are now live  enabling a faster  most secure guest checkout experience for their customers Further  beginning in mid 2020 this year  Citibank plans to streamline the checkout experience at participating merchants by leveraging pushed provisioning to make the Click to Pay enrollment process much easier for Citi branded credit card holders in North America We also signed several deals with merchants for our tokenization capabilities  which as you know  Technical Issues  security and they sort of approve    the approval rates improve and a better experience for merchant s customers  Recent partners to sign on to use this tokenized card on file solution include Amazon  Stripe  MercadoLibre  PayPal and several of the largest US wireless and telecom providers  And on to Contactless  well I said  we re making real progress  This quarter  Contactless made up over 30  of global card present purchased  Technical Issues   Contactless provides a frictionless and fast payment experience  which is opening new categories of spend including displacing cash on small ticket purchases The US point for growth on this front and the New York City MTA is a good example of the potential for rapid adoption by consumers  In fact  they have surpassed 5 million taps since the launch in May and the MTS plans to rollout contactless acceptance systemwide by the end of 2020  And onto new payment flows  Technical Issues  capabilities  which we re using to penetrate new flows  including recent successes of Mastercard Send Bank of America will now use Mastercard Send for their business to consumer card disbursements in the US on an exclusive basis  In the insurance space  All States will expand the use of Mastercard Send across their enterprise to power instant insurance claims payouts  PayPal will utilize Mastercard Send in 10 new markets across Asia Pacific  Technical Issues  to enable users to transfer funds from their PayPal wallets to their eligible accounts  And also leveraging our capabilities to help facilitate more efficient cross border payments So here  as an example  Swiss Bankers  a Swiss prepaid card issuer launched a new money transfer service using Mastercard Send that enables consumers to make secured payments to recipients  bank accounts  digital wallets and eligible cards in 18 countries  We re also partnering  Technical Issues  which is the switch in Russia and the Central Bank in Russia to bring cross border functionality to the Russian domestic faster payment system Moving on to bill pay  we ve gone live in the US with our Bill Pay Exchange product  we are leveraging technology from our transacted cycle position  Bill Pay Exchange provides an enhanced bill pay experience for banks  for consumers  and for billers  and our initial launch partners include US Bank  a large buyer and Avidia Bank  with Jack  Technical Issues  Associates agreeing to participate later this year We plan to add additional functionality and new partners throughout 2020  We ve also entered into a partnership with Pine Labs  They provide a range of point of sale and prepaid solutions to merchants across India  Southeast Asia and the Middle East  This partnership is focused on offering installment payment solutions to merchants and consumers across both card and real time payment rails   Technical Issues We re also going to work with Pine Labs to offer a range of prepaid  loyalty and cyber security services to customers  and this partnership is consistent with our strategy to deliver greater choice to consumers and be the partner of choice for our customers Open banking is another area where we work some time to develop the right set of comprehensive solutions and services that work for all the players in the ecosystem  banks  fintechs merchants and consumers  Our solutions are live today in Europe and we are focused on ensuring that the ecosystem can provide for the real time exchange of information and transactions but most importantly protecting the interest and data of all participants  including our fintech and bank customers We see open banking is an important global trend and a significant opportunity and believe that our leadership in data privacy as well as our scale in real time and cross border payments are very good  Technical Issues  key to optimizing open banking solutions for banks  for fintechs  for merchants and for consumers globally Now beyond payments  we made good progress on our digital identity solution  Here digital identity is aiming to allow individuals to own  control and share their identity credentials their way on the devices they use every day  We believe that our commitment to the responsible handling of personal information  letting consumer  Technical Issues  ownership of their own data and giving them control over which data is used and how it is used is critical to our consumers increasingly digital life Mastercard s network is able to check a consumer s chosen credentials and confirm them for the intended recipient and purpose without ever taking possession of the underlying Identity data  So Mastercard is uniquely positioned in this field  given our experience in governance and operating  Technical Issues  our focus on financial inclusion  our announced and clear sensitivity of data privacy and our commitment to investment in a global  interoperable infrastructure We recently launched pilots in public and private institutions in Australia  which actually is one of the countries at the forefront of digital identification  and this set of pilots enabled participants to use their digital identities to access certain government and student services  We ve also additional digital identity  Technical Issues  and pilot  if you would see us introducing in more markets throughout 2020  and we look forward to continuing to innovate and grow and embed ourselves on this front With that  let me turn the call over to Sachin for an update on our financial results and our operational metrics  Sachin Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ajay  So turning to page 3  you will see that we have delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter to end the year  Here are a few highlights on a currency neutral basis and excluding special items  as well as the  Technical Issues  losses on the company s equity investments Net revenue grew 17  driven by solid broad based momentum in our core products and services  Acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to this growth  Total operating expenses increased 12   which includes a 4 ppt increase related to acquisitions Operating income grew by 22  and net income was up 25  reflecting our strong operating performance and which includes a 2 ppt and  Technical Issues  ppt reduction due to acquisitions respectively  EPS grew 28  year over year to  1 96  which includes a  0 05 contribution from share repurchases and  0 02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions During the quarter  we repurchased about  1 billion worth of stock  and an additional  438 million through January 27  2020  So now let s turn to page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter  Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 12  on a local currency basis down 2 ppt from last quarter  primarily due to the impact of the differing number of processing days between periods  as well as some lapping of previous wins US GDV grew 9   down approximately 3 ppt from last quarter with credit and debit growth of 12  and 7  respectively  Outside of the US  volume growth was 14  down 2 ppt from last quarter  Cross border volume grew at 16  on a local currency basis  driven by double digit growth across most regions Turning to page 5  switched transactions showed strong growth at 19  globally  reflecting in part the ongoing adoption of contactless  We saw healthy double digit growth in switched transactions across most regions  In addition  card growth was 5   Globally  there are 2 6 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued Now let s turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items  again described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted  The 17  net revenue increase was primarily driven by strong transaction and volume growth  as well as strong growth in our services offerings  partially offset by rebates and incentives  As previously mentioned  acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to this growth Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items  Domestical assets grew 14  while worldwide GDV grew 12   The 2 ppt difference is primarily driven by pricing  Cross border volume fees grew 16  in line with cross border volume growth of 16   Transaction processing fees grew 18  while switched transactions grew 19   The 1 ppt difference is primarily driven by mix  Finally  on other revenues  which were up 25  including a 4 ppt contribution from acquisitions  Technical Issues  the remaining growth was primarily driven by our cyber and intelligence and data and services solutions Moving on to page 7  you can see that on a currency neutral non GAAP basis  total operating expenses increased 12   This includes 4 ppt related to acquisitions  as well as 2 ppt related to the differential and hedging gains and losses versus the year ago period  The remaining 6 ppt of growth related to our continued investment in strategic initiatives such as  Technical Issues  safety and security  geographic expansion  and new payment inflows Turning to slide 8  let s discuss what we ve seen through the first three weeks of January where each of our drivers are generally consistent with what we saw in Q4  The numbers through January 21st are as follows  Starting with switched volume  we saw global growth of 15  similar to the fourth quarter  In the US  our switched volume grew 11   switched volume grew    switched volume outside the US grew  Technical Issues  18   Globally  switched transaction growth was 19  similar to the fourth quarter With respect to cross border  our volumes grew 15  globally  down 1 ppt sequentially  For the year  we expect cross border growth to be in the mid teens range and this is contemplated in our thoughts for revenue growth for the year  Turning now to slide 9 and our thoughts for 2020  We expect the economic outlook to be similar to what we saw in 2019  Our business  Technical Issues  remain strong with growth driven by a mix of new deals  renewed agreements  and the expansion of our differentiated service offerings  We expect net revenue to grow at a low teens rate on a currency neutral basis  excluding acquisitions Rebates and incentives growth is expected to be higher year over year  driven by renewed and expanded deals that Ajay just commented on  In the first quarter  net revenue growth is expected to be about 2 ppt lower than this annual estimate  Technical Issues  primarily due to higher growth in rebates and incentives  We expect that net revenue growth will increase throughout the balance of the year as we implement new wins and fees related volume Foreign exchange is expected to have a minimal impact to annual growth  but is expected to be about a 1 ppt headwind in the first quarter  In terms of operating expenses  we expect growth for both the year and the first quarter at the high end of the high single digit range on a currency  Technical Issues  basis  excluding acquisitions and special items  This is driven by our continued investments in digital  analytics and security products  and platforms to address new payment flows  Foreign exchange is going to have a minimal impact to opex growth for both the year and the first quarter Turning to M A  As you know  over the years  we have used acquisitions to supplement our organic efforts and diversify our revenues  You have seen this in areas such as data analytics  cyber and intelligence  loyalty  Technical Issues  and developing multi wave solutions for our customers  This has helped expand our addressable markets  drive new revenue streams and strengthen our core product solutions As a reminder  we are disciplined in our approach  as we work with our acquisitions to breakeven within 24 months of close  With that context  let me outline the expected 2020 impact of our recent acquisitions  which are progressing well In terms of net revenues  we expect acquisitions to add about 2 ppt  Technical Issues  for the year and about 1 ppt for Q1  assuming that the transaction with Nets closes in the second quarter  which is our current estimate  For opex  acquisitions are expected to add an additional 7 ppt to 9 ppt to growth for both the year and the quarter  For the year  this estimate includes the full year effect of the acquisitions made in 2019 including purchase accounting and integration related costs  This also assumes the anticipated closing of the transaction with Nets A couple of other items of note beyond acquisitions  In other income and expense line  we are at a quarterly expense run rate of approximately  50 million based on our current debt levels  This excludes gains and losses from our equity investments  With respect to tax  you should assume a tax rate of approximately 17  to 18  for the year So just to sum all of this up  2019 was an excellent year both in terms of financial performance and in setting us up for the  Technical Issues   We have signed a number of important deals  developed a strong pipeline of products to address growth in the short  medium and long term and made several acquisitions to broaden our capabilities  We are pleased with the progress we are making and our outlook for 2020 is for continued strong growth With that  let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q A session Warren Kneeshaw    Executive Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Sachin  Marcella  we re now ready for the Q A session Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom from UBS  Your line is open Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystThanks very much  and good morning  Ajay  I just wanted to see if we could get an update on the progress on Mastercard Track  And in terms of the US experience and maybe Australia  which I think was also recently initiated in the past year Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So Track actually  you ve got different elements  So Australia was part of the whole B2B  Technical Issues  hub we are referring to  The US also had a B2B hub but Track is an overall approach to the B2B payment space  That starts with having the right merchant directories  and then connects sort of small business and business directories that are all compliance run through and the fully informed directory attached to a invoice presentment engine but also enable to payment optimization engine and a reconciliation system  That s all built inside  then it uses  Technical Issues  distribution channels  one of which is something like the B2B hubs that we have talked about in the past  But you can also go to what are issuers  agents and buyers  agents  and there is a whole ecosystem there that we re getting into and putting our footprint into So that s kind of where we are  We piloted during 2019 with customers the full business payment service kind of solution  which we ve been developing in the US and in fact also in Latin America  we are rolling it out globally starting in the US in the first quarter  Technical Issues   You will get to more geographies and more payments over time  that s what we are at  that s where we are going Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystOkay  And if I may just have one follow up on that  To the extent that    to what extent is the  are the volumes and revenue benefits from the Mastercard Track hub in the SME B2B space contemplated in the 2020 outlook Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerAs we told you when we were discussing this at Investor Day as well  this  Technical Issues  more developed  For example  our corporate purchasing cards  our fleet cards  our SME cards  our virtual account numbers  our cross border travel payment systems  those are all relatively well developed and are well factored into the way we think about 2020  The B2B hub to an extent because it s got Bank of America  First Hawaiian and Fifth Third in the US  and MYOB in Australia  but that s like four customers across the world And for a company of our size  well that s important for B2B  Technical Issues  bigger picture  What we re really talking about is adding those on over the course of the next two years to three years  So we don t have that built in any great way in 2020  If we knock the lights out of that that will be great  but I have a view that this kind of thing takes a little time  Remember as I explained the ecosystem  not only do you build the technology across all of those phases  You also have to sign up all the distribution that enables you to connect with this relatively new ecosystem that tracks specifically them Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystThank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tien tsin Huang from JP Morgan  Your line is open Tien tsin Huang    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks  good morning  Great results here  I was encouraged to hear the mid teens outlook for cross border  I think getting a lot of questions on the Corona virus and how to maybe frame that s all I ll ask you guys  if you don t mind  How much of your cross border book is tied to the China region  And is there a way to maybe look back or reference SARS or swine flu or something else to maybe give a clue on what    what this one might do  Thanks Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerHey Tien tsin  good morning  it s Sachin  Let me give you a little bit of a color on cross border  right  So as I mentioned  we could see double digit growth across most of our regions as it relates to cross border  And as I kind of sit back and I think about  it would be a good solid steady performance coming out of the US  As it relates to EMEA  and that s Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific as well  we continue to see solid growth  We saw some softness in  Technical Issues  and Mexico  a function of the local environment out there  but by and large the business is running in a very healthy pace To your specific question around the impact of the Corona virus  here s what I ll tell you  It s early days  Fortunately  a decent portion of our inbound and outbound cross border from China is e comm related  So it provides some level of a hedge  And we will continue to monitor the environment  It s too early to tell at this point in time  how this thing plays out Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerRemember  Tien tsin people have bought air tickets and they still time it out for the Lunar New Year  Now if this thing goes much bigger  and becomes a much more sort of urgent and immediate crisis across many parts of the world  then we ll take a look at those numbers once again  But you re going to take this as it comes  one step at a time  and that s the only way to look at this carefully  Because remember when SARS was on  and that was way back in the early part of the last decade in 2003 and 2004  the total business in China was also smaller  The total size of our company was also smaller  and our ability to be a real player in cross border across many corridors 18 years ago was very different  So I kind of wouldn t go too much on that  I would rather think about the natural hedge that e commerce provides  the fact that there s still a lot of travel there but that could change over the next few weeks  And we will keep an eye on it  very carefully Tien tsin Huang    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  Now that s helpful  thank you for that  Just real quick follow up if you don t mind  just on the    I think I heard you say  Bank of America Mastercard Send that was an exclusive arrangement  is that the case  And I m curious if that s maybe a new model that we can    we can expect with that product Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerFactually correct  you did hear correctly  Your ears are in good shape  Tien tsin  even if you had an airpod shoved inside  but I m not a    I can t tell you if that s a new model going forward  It s the way that in this particular case  Bank of America found value from what we are doing  I don t know yet  Technical Issues  these don t make a trend Tien tsin Huang    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous  Your line is open Craig Maurer    Autonomous Research    AnalystYeah  hi  thanks  I had a question about recent acquisition activity in the space  Your largest competitor seems to have gone in a somewhat different direction from what we ve seen from your acquisitions  and I wanted to get your updated thoughts on acquisitions that moved Mastercard closer to the consumer or closer directly to the merchant  Thanks Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Craig  We ve done it    well closer to the consumer  You got to remember we are a B2B2C company  And so what we are not trying to do is get in between our customers and their consumers  That s really not  What we are trying to do is to provide services or capabilities or product sets  Technical Issues  that enables that customer to be a merchant  It could be a government funded authority  a bank  or fintech reach their consumer better  That s yes  100   that we are into So for example  and your specific question are around how you reach fintechs and the like  I m assuming that s fair  The reference to our competitor comes from    we ve built a series of capabilities in Europe where as you know PSD2 has changed the layout between fintech and banks  very substantive there  And there we are actually live with the whole idea of connect  protect and resolve and consult capabilities across a number of fintechs and banks and AISPs and PISPs and all the terminology that has now become part of the day to day conversation in Europe That s a fairly strong position for us  What I do want to make sure in all of this with merchants  for example  your question on merchants  we ve done a series of transactions that provide data analytical and cyber security services to merchants  Ethoca is a most recent example  RiskRecon is even more recent than that  Loyalty rewards schemes that we bought some years ago are connected to that  Brighterion does a series of things with merchants and banks and fintechs So most of our acquisitions kind of cross this ecosystem  What I am committed to  is to doing it in a way that respects the rights and the privileges of all the different players of the ecosystem  and doing it in a way that  Technical Issues  data and privacy all through the system  So we will keep looking for acquisitions that enhance those few words I just mentioned  Security and privacy of data  these responsibilities and rights and the priorities of different players in the ecosystem  You ll see us doing that very carefully  very sensibly and keeping at it Craig Maurer    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  If I could ask one follow up  Just on the guidance  what s the thought process for rebates and incentives for the full year as a percentage of gross revenue Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerSorry  could you say  you broke out there Craig   Craig Maurer    Autonomous Research    AnalystYeah  yeah  Sorry  sorry Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerYeah I think I got rebates and incentives  Your question was what s the guidance on rebates and incentives  I m not going to give you specific guidance  but what I will tell you is we do expect the level of growth in rebates and incentives to pick up in 2020  That s on the back of the deals  which we ve signed  that s all of the news as far as I m concerned  because the way it kind of plays out is these are new and expand  Technical Issues  these expanded deals come with incremental volume  All of that kind of plays into the thoughts I ve shared for 2020 Craig Maurer    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  Thank you Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Craig  one last point on acquisitions  You should expect us to remain relatively committed to the idea of buying something that can breakeven at the end of the year too  And then it becomes part of our base  We no longer pull it out and you should expect that discipline from us  I believe that adequate targets in the ecosystem   Technical Issues  our priority areas that can help us grow while doing that in a way that transforms our company as it has done for the last 10 years in a sensible way  that is the right way to approach the value of an acquisition Craig Maurer    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  thank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson  Your line is open Lisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson    AnalystHi  good morning guys  So looking for a few comments on China  not on the Corona virus  just more broadly  It feels like with the recent trade agreement and then some of these announcements with Alipay and WeChat Pay opening up their wallets to cards  PayPal s I guess recent acquisition of GoPay there  it feels like the market might actually finally be loosening up  But on the other hand  we felt this way before  Ajay  I was just kind of curious  what s your current sort of optimism level around Mastercard getting access to the domestic China market  sense of timing likelihood  And then an updated view maybe on how you re thinking about approaching this market  given it s so different from others around the world  Thank you Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Lisa  I m going to have to take away anything to do with the Corona virus  I have obviously no answer  because that s got an impact that I don t yet know how to predict specifically for China  I mean we as a company had on that particular topic  we ve actually given our employees two extra weeks to work from home  using that ability so that we try to help them manage their own families and their own situation  in a way that s responsible for them  So we are clearly  Technical Issues  nervous like everybody else is  about what s going on there  So just move on from that  And I ve said the trade deal itself  it is the first time that I ve seen a trade deal where companies are mentioned by name  in terms of what should be agreed upon between two different governments in a bilateral trade deal I hope that means that all of us will get a better chance to play in the domestic ecosystem in China and then we will bring them our  Technical Issues  party and then we will fight and win what we can win  We are late to the party because the digital players there have already built substantially good businesses and frankly very good offerings  So they deserve to have won  what they have won  The question would be how do we then break in and how well do we do in that and that s going to be our task in China  My general attempt about that part of the business is  I ve seen this movie earlier  I m going to only say anything about  Technical Issues  actually see something in writing that changes what our position on the ground is  Meanwhile  we re doing things  We publicly  there s been speculation that we are looking at partners to be able to go into the domestic processing business with  That s kind of one angle  which everybody is looking at  so are we  There s clearly an effort to build out the acquiring footprint  so that our acceptance expansion can begin to happen  There s an effort to build out the issuing relationships so that that hit the ground running Meanwhile  you referred to Alibaba and WeChat accepting our cards into their domestic wallet  that s also been part of some effort  There s conversations going on with them on all kinds of partnership opportunities where we may compete or may not compete  So it s kind of    there s a lot going on in China  We are hiring people  We ve been doing that for the last two years or three years  We re building talent and skills on the ground  So kind of that s where we are  And I think my approach to the market there is  there will be infrastructure capability  build acceptance  build the right partnerships  build people and skills on the ground and learn how to do that in a market that is as you said dramatically different from the others  So  I think local presence  local knowledge and local capability is going to be really important in China Lisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson    AnalystTerrific  And then maybe as my follow up  just a quick update on the contactless deployments in the US  Do you have any updated stats on sort of where we are in terms of card issuance  merchant acceptance  And are you expecting in the 2020 outlook  an uptick in US volumes as a result of that  or is it more of a 2021 dynamic  Thank you Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerI m pretty certain that US contactless associate growing throughout 2020 quite attractively  because if you look at the numbers of    the number of bank partners that have committed to issue contactless cards  for a minute  let s even forget Apple Pay and Samsung Pay that enable every card through their RFID devices to be used  If you just look at the number of cards  we are talking about 70  of our total cards in the US market will be reissued over this 12 month to 14 month period  My own personal cards are already contactless from Citi  And so  I think you will see that happening  Cabela s is doing that  There s a bunch of others that are actually deeply embedded into the idea of contactless cards On the acceptance side  as you know  all new terminals going out are embedded with contactless  So  Technical Issues  the large retailers like Target and 7 Eleven and CVS have announced that they will accept contactless payments  And in fact  over half of US card present transactions are now happening at contactless enabled merchant locations  And when the MTA rolls it out systemwide in New York City there are other transit systems beginning to do the same in their cities  I think you will get the impetus  Some of it will come in 2020  to your earlier question  More of it will come in 2021  But outside the US that kind of growth pattern is pretty strongly embedded  You know that in Australia  over 80  of transactions under AUD100 are contactless  So there is a lot going on in that space Lisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson    AnalystExcellent  Thank you  Nice quarter as always guys  thanks a lot Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chris Donat from Piper Sandler  Your line is open Christopher Donat    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  Thanks for taking my question  and thanks for the work on contactless as an NPA writer  I deeply appreciate not having to swipe anymore  The question I want to ask  Ajay  was about the other revenue and the percent    or the portion of that that s organic  Just how sustainable is this roughly 20  level of growth in organic other revenue and or is it even possible to accelerate with some of your work on the data and other offerings Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerSachin  go ahead Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerSure  Hey  Chris  Sure  Hey  Chris  So very quickly some color around the other revenue line item  right  I mean  you ve seen that in Q4  we ve talked about 25  growth rate in other revenues  That had about 4 ppt coming from acquisitions  So that s why you come up with your number of about 20  for Q4  Let me give you some context  There are three main components  which are there in other revenues  Some of our services lines roll up here  things like cyber and intelligence products  data analytics  consulting and managed services as well as loyalty  right  A significant portion of  Technical Issues  recurring in nature  Although there are some such as consulting and loyalty engagements that are project based and can have some timing between quarters The second item which is there in other revenues is our Vocalink related revenues  And again this is recurring in nature  And finally  we put a number of our recent acquisitions and I know you said net of acquisitions  but remember the acquisitions  which we have done will at some point in time become the equivalent of organic growth  to your sense  And we put those into the other revenue because of the  Technical Issues  model  So net net net  I would tell you a decent portion of other revenues is recurring in nature  although we are not providing specific estimates for this line item  I will say other revenues excluding acquisitions  We expect that will grow faster than the overall company growth rate Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerJust remember that the    a lot of the acquisitions are basically either meant to enhance what Sachin started with  which is our data analytics capability or our cyber and security capability or our management  Technical Issues  loyalty capability  A number of them  not all of them  a number of them  When you do that and two years into acquiring them to become part of a base  they then become part of organic revenue and expenses So we have to manage the business in a way that at the end of the second year breakeven each of them individually and then starts becoming margin accretive in the third year  That s the discipline that s embedded inside the P L line by line with each business that acquired single entity during the year  Absolutely  I expect that organic growth will continue to be good in that line item  And as Sachin said probably higher than that of the whole company Christopher Donat    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And just as a follow up  Sachin  on the project based component of that  is that  that s relatively small though  right  The recurring component of the other revenues much more significant  Right Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial Officer Technical Issues  The recurring component is more significant than the project based component  As I mentioned  it s the project based stuff is typically our consulting and managed services  so this is    and loyalty pieces  But then again you go back into cyber intelligence recurring in nature  Vocalink recurring in nature  a lot of these things are things where you signed agreements and then they kind of stay in play for some time  So  yes Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerThere s been a lot of effort that has gone into convert some of the non recurring into recurring in the manner in which we sign deals and have to work with partners   Technical Issues  the idea of what we like is recurring revenues  but that s non recurring because it opens it all OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research  Your line is open Darrin Peller    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  thanks guys  I just want to hone in a little more on cross border for a minute just given that it did show a little bit of a deceleration into January  I think you said 15  and comps do get easier  So just  I know you talked about mid teens for the year  But can you give us more color on what type of activity you re seeing in terms of specifically e comm versus travel  And then I don t think I ve ever heard you update what the e comm percentage of cross border actually is  if you can help us with that Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so on cross border  First  I would just kind of caution and say  we re three weeks into the month of January and the 1 ppt decline  which we re seeing between 16  in Q4 and 15  in the first three weeks of January  I wouldn t make too much of that  right  Hence the comment which I made about  Technical Issues  we still expect mid teens from a cross border standpoint  Just but more specifically around some color on what we re seeing on cross border standpoint  steady growth in the US  right  As it relates to our card not present cross border  we see that approximately 20  and that s fairly consistent as we ve seen over the past few quarters  As it relates to region by region  in Q4  our APMEA region  which is a combination of Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa saw some  Technical Issues  as I mentioned earlier  And on the flip side  in LAC  we saw some level of weakness in Mexico in particular  But there are puts and takes every quarter on this  That s really the color which I ve got  It s steady as it goes as far as growth right now  And then we ll pick it up from there Darrin Peller    Wolfe Research    AnalystAll right  Just a quick kind of housekeeping  I mean you still expect Nets to close  I think you said first half  I just want to verify that  And if you could remind us of any potential financial impact that we should expect on the year with that on the top and bottom line  And then also when you think of  Ajay  just make sure that deal doesn t preclude you from doing other meaningful deals this year  are you really on the active hunt right now for something in the first half Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo on the deal front  as I said earlier  we look at 40  50  60 deals in a year  And in some years we close none or one or two  And last year  we provided more than that number  And  Technical Issues  people who are like  indecipherable  in Santa s Shop  they re working very hard on this  Technical Issues  I m sure you like that reference  And they re working really hard on this thing  right and they produce stuff and then we kind of look at it and say that one doesn t make sense either because it doesn t fit our strategic profile or the M A numbers don t make sense or that somehow it doesn t respect those principles I was speaking about when I was asking Craig s    answering his question Or some of them do and then yet others get lot longer because the negotiation doesn t work out or the due diligence scares the heck out of us  And so it just carries on like that  I don t know how to give you an answer  I would tell you  nothing s changed  I ve been on the hunt from the day I joined and still in the hunt Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I ll just add to Ajay s comment  you asked specifically about Nets  Obviously  we re going through the regulatory approval process as we speak right now  It s our estimate to close Nets in the second quarter of this year  that s the basis of what I ve given in the nature of thoughts for 2020  where I kind of mentioned to you that on a portfolio basis  we expect about 2 ppt contribution from acquisitions on revenues and so we re in that 7  to 9  growth in opex related to acquisitions Darrin Peller    Wolfe Research    AnalystAll right  guys  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies  Your line is open Trevor Williams    Jefferies    AnalystHi  good morning and thanks for taking my question and sorry to pile on the China theme  but I m just curious on the outbound cross border volume from China  So is China UnionPay and WeChat and Alipay have been partnering more with acquirers globally to expand their acceptance footprint outside of China  I guess I m just wondering  longer term  how much of a risk you think there could be to your outbound cross border volume just if acceptance of those three big Chinese players reaches critical mass  just at least in the major tourist hubs  And I m not sure if I caught this  in response to the question from Tien tsin  But I was just wondering what percentage of cross border is Chinese outbound Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerSecond part  is there any  Speech Overlap  The first part  I can tell you what s was going on  I mean look first of all  this is not a new issue of these bilateral agreements between both card and the Chinese digital wallets with players outside  You should know that card specifically is concerned because the way the Chinese rules changed over time  what used to be a dual branded card which are still a large number of that  all the new issuance is single branded  So banks that are issuing our cards in China and we are issuing lot of cards there every year  Those are all now single branded and therefore when they go overseas those cards can only be running on Mastercard rails and their transaction  Technical Issues  taken on to somebody else s risk  that s just factual And so just as there is a put and a take on both sides of that  similarly in the case of digital wallets outbound while in    both inbound and outbound used to be not us playing in Alipay and WeChat  You ve now known and seen that they have announced for inbound and there is always ways for them to work with them like they are already doing on different aspects of their outbound work  Will that lead to a complete  open system or not  I don t know  Will that change  We have been also operating domestically  because the total scale and size of our operation with them will change  I don t know  we ll see Meanwhile there s  a lot of volume that comes out of China  which has been enabled by the new digital players that I don t believe is going away from us  This is    it s the bigger size of the pie game that we are also talking about  And so our growth on cross border out of China has been relatively healthy  It goes through its quarterly ups and downs  it goes through stuff but it s relatively healthy and I presume that will stay that way over the next few years Obviously  Corona virus and stuff as we discussed already could change a quarter here or quarter there  I don t know that yet  And we are very carefully keeping an eye on it  but in the big picture  I still see lots of opportunity on our cross border from China Trevor Williams    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Now  that s really helpful  Thank you  And just one quick follow up  I was hoping to just get a little bit more color around some of the mix dynamics  So I know last quarter was a bit unique  you had negative mix across domestic assessments cross border and transaction processing  On the domestic assessments  there was a couple hundred basis point benefit this quarter just with pricing  but it looks like transaction processing was lower again due to mix  just relative to process transaction growth  Just curious anything there that you can provide just color wise to help explain the delta  Thanks Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so our transaction processing growth rate  as you know switched transactions are growing at a nice clip at 19  and we re pretty much in line from a transaction processing fee standpoint  What I would tell you is  as the business grows  and as we do more in the nature of contactless payments so on and so forth and you start to proliferate down into smaller ticket payments  it does have an impact from a mix standpoint  You would expect to see that It s depending on market and  Technical Issues  question  I wouldn t make too much of the disparity between the two  The other thing I would tell you is in transaction processing fees there are line items  which are beyond just the high correlation to switched transactions  In other words  some portion of our services related revenues also are comprised in the transaction processing fees Trevor Williams    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  No  that s very helpful  Thanks guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from BoA  Your line is open Jason Kupferberg    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  good morning guys  Wanted to start with a question just on US credit volume growth still remains quite robust here  I m wondering how many more quarters of tailwind do we have from Cabela s before that lapse  Are you seeing any noticable uptick from the Apple Card  Venmo card or any commentary on kind of the consumer versus the commercial pieces of US credit  And just at a high level trying to get a sense of the sustainability of these double digit levels as you do get to some tougher comps I think in the next few quarters Sachin Mehra    Chief Financial OfficerHi Jason  it s Sachin  So very quickly I want to give you a little color on    I mentioned earlier about  in my prepared remarks  something about lapping wins  The Cabela s portfolio has begun to lap  right as part of our Q4 metrics  as I mentioned earlier  So also Krogers but then for all the market share wins  which we ve had over the course of the last 12 months  that s starting to roll on  So you are starting to see some of the effect then in the nature of Apple Card  so on and so forth Also I will mention that we talked about the deals we signed with Citi  and Capital One  We would expect that  that will also start to roll in  So there will be puts and takes  there will be previously won portfolio which will lap  And then there will be new portfolios and new market share wins  which will come in  So all in all  a good performance from a credit standpoint in the US  as you mentioned Jason Kupferberg    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAnd just one for Ajay  I m curious to get your thoughts on synergies potentially between Nets and Vocalink  I know there s some differences there in geographic exposure  but are there some broader enhancements to your alternative network capabilities from the Nets deal  or are these just kind of separate offerings for different segments of the real time payments market Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes and yes actually  it s a really good question  Yes and yes  actually  So it s a really good question  What you are buying with Nets Corporate Services in the Nordics is not just the similar thing to what Vocalink does  So Vocalink both operates the infrastructure  provides for the software real time payments as well as batch processing and ATM  Technical Issues  but also provides applications and services on top of that infrastructure in the United Kingdom That is more similar to the 327 deal that we have signed in the Nordics where with the banks in the Nordics  we are going to implement fast and real time payments capabilities using Vocalink s sort of structure and then operate it for them in the Nordics  We are doing that in a number of other countries around the world  We re doing it in different flavor  some of them are software deals  some of them we will operate everything  Technical Issues  Saudi  Peru  the Philippines and so on  right  So there s that element The Nets Corporate Services piece  that we ve bought in    that we are trying to close on in the second quarter of the Nordics  actually provides for using all those underlying services for payments and bills and they connect all the B2B payment systems  they connect all kinds of players in the Nordics and outside of the Nordics with Nordic players  So  that s a whole different capability  We are quite hopeful that we can apply both these solutions to different segments as well as enhance each other s capabilities in different markets around the world  So Paul Stoddart who runs all this for us and came out of Vocalink  He used to be the Chief Operating Officer of Vocalink when we first bought them Paul is kind of the guy who is running all this for us and stitching it together over the next period of time  It s a great question Jason Kupferberg    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald  Your line is open Joseph Foresi    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHi  I was wondering if you could talk about the margin profile of the business  short and long term  I know you ve given comments in the back past that you don t run the business to the margin  but given the differences between you and your competitor  I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on your  on the progression or cadence there Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerMy view has been that we will    it s a mathematical calculation on business in some ways  So long as you keep revenue and the margin appropriately and you manage your expenses right  this business has a higher fixed costs in a lower variable cost per transaction  If you add more capacity and you pump more volume through it  you will find us growing at the margin  even on your operating margin  that s just math  What s changing along the way is that we are trying to take that math and apply that surplus we get to building and diversifying the revenues of this company and those    when you acquire those businesses  they may not follow that  But over time they get there as a number of our services businesses used to be less recurring back to an earlier question  now they have got a much higher profile of recurring revenue A number of our services businesses  their margins have grown over time as the volume being put through them  Thanks to their access to our network of distribution and partners increases  So our attitude toward our margin is healthy growth  not kind of pushing that at what we ve managed to  We managed gross and net revenue and we managed to expenses and we managed that kind of space for our future  We don t actually manage to margin  That s why I said  we ll keep a healthy margin of 50 plus because I want you to know I m not going to throw money away  kind of my reference to even the acquisitions and the discipline around the acquisitions  but the idea is that we would eventually  always through math  be growing sensibly  You could see it over the last few years Joseph Foresi    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystGot it and then just as a follow up  Speech Overlap  Okay  great  I appreciate it  Well  this will  I ll make it a softball then  So you can end on a good note   Speech Overlap  yeah  well  I ll do my best now  Focus is on it  right  So  but you ve done a great job of expanding your addressable market into new areas  We talked about B2B and contactless and I know China is on the horizon  maybe over the long term  Which of these areas are you most excited about in the short term over the next year  Where should we be spending our time because there s just it seems to be an expanding amount of areas in their expanding addressable market  Thanks Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think over the short term  we should continue to remain very focused on our cyber and intelligence services business and you should look forward to more growth in contactless  Everything else just by the nature of the ecosystem that we work in  has a longer time to result than these  These ones we are able to put to a solution system  in a form that enables us to have a little more control over the outcome than we would in the others and we got to work everybody toward it Joseph Foresi    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystThank you Warren Kneeshaw    Executive Vice President of Investor RelationsAll right  thanks  any final comments Ajay Ajay Banga    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  sir  First I want to wrap up very quickly  Thank you for all your questions  We ve had another strong year  We ve had broad based growth across each of our regions  With driving solid deal momentum  we re trying to capture new flows through the conversation  we were just having with our multi rail capabilities  Our recent acquisitions are performing well within the  Technical Issues  that we ve talked again today  We look forward to working with our new colleagues from RiskRecon  We ve got another one  the Nets Corporate Services on the horizon  When that comes in  we are going to work hard with them and we are progressing well against the three year performance objectives that we laid out for you for 2019  2020 and 2021 With that  thank you all for being a part of this journey

189511,411027,MA,Mastercard s Q4 2019 Report Supports Its Premium Valuation,news,"Digital payment processing giant Mastercard  NYSE MA  just finished out 2019 on a strong note  Fourth quarter business results accelerated once again  leading to yet another big jump in the bottom line  Mastercard stock has been a dead ringer for investors in the last decade  and with the 2020s now upon us  this leader in the war on cash still has lots of good stuff going for it 
A rundown on 2019
Even though Mastercard is a massive operation that hauls in billions in revenue every quarter from its toll booth like operation  it charges a small fee every time a transaction is processed on its system   the growth story is far from over  Physical money is still by far the preferred method of transacting business around the globe  leaving Mastercard and its fellow war on cash peers plenty of room to keep expanding  
In fact  though it is quite large  Mastercard s momentum has been picking up speed as of late after a sleepy start to 2019    helped by adoption of digital payments in emerging markets and a string of technology acquisitions the last few years  geared especially toward the company s add on services like data analytics and digital payment security  

Data source  Mastercard  
The 16  top line gain in Q4 was accompanied by another advance in operating profit margins  which were up to 54 4  on an adjusted basis  which backs out one time non recurring items  compared with 52 3  a year ago  The gross dollar volume of transactions processed in the period grew 12  to  1 7 trillion  and other revenues    primarily cybersecurity and data services    grew 24   Added into results from the rest of the year  2019 was a pretty good run for Mastercard   

Pp   percentage point  Data source  Mastercard  
In other news  currency exchange rates once again didn t work in Mastercard s favor and took a small toll on the report card  In total  fluctuations in currency values reduced revenue and adjusted earnings by 3  each  Helping offset the headwind  though  was another massive return of capital to owners of the stock   6 5 billion in share repurchases  2  of the current market cap of  326 billion  and  1 3 billion in dividends  which equates to a current annual yield of 0 5     

Don t sweat the premium
Mastercard shares have run up a more than 1 200  return in the last decade    including nearly 200  in the last three years alone  The stock price has simply been following profitability higher in that stretch of time  and that will likely continue even though Mastercard trades for premium pricing  currently at 41 7 times the last year s worth of adjusted earnings  
I say so because of the company s steadily rising top line  aided by the company s ability to make high growth acquisitions  and its huge profit margins  The added bonus  of course  is share repurchases  which lower share count and boost earnings per share  It s a powerful combination that should continue to equate to double digit bottom line growth for a long time  Management expects revenues to expand at another low teens percentage rate in 2020    excluding the effect of any acquisitions made    so another corresponding profit increase is certainly in the cards  Based on 2020 projections  the stock trades for 30 2 times earnings  still premium pricing  but well deserved  After the Q4 update  Mastercard remains one of my favorite stocks ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poyfe,2071726
189512,411028,MA,Mastercard wants to give you fast access to cash   using only your cell phone,news,Mastercard Cash Pick Up lets anyone with a cell phone  even those without a bank account  withdraw cash from a nearby ATM More than 32 million U S  households are  unbanked  or  underbanked   meaning they either don t have bank accounts or have accounts but also use services such as payday loans to help make ends meet The nascent technology could open up users to fraud such as imposter scams  some experts said ,2020-01-30,CNBC,https://invst.ly/pp1vg,2072080
189513,411029,MA,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love MasterCard  MA ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
MasterCard  MA  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this processor of debit and credit card payments is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for MasterCard is 20 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 15 6  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for MasterCard is 33 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 16  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 10 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for MasterCard  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made MasterCard a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions MasterCard well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2020-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-mastercard-ma-200499752,200499752
189514,411030,MA,MasterCard  MA  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"MasterCard  MA  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This processor of debit and credit card payments is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 7  
Revenues are expected to be  4 40 billion  up 15 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MasterCard 
For MasterCard  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MasterCard will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that MasterCard would post earnings of  2 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 15  delivering a surprise of  6 97  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
MasterCard doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mastercard-ma-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200500675,200500675

CPRT   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Will the S P 500 Record Highest Returns Since 1997  5 PicksThe impressive turnaround by Wall Street in 2019  after the market mayhem of 2018  is set to reach a milestone at the end of this year  Buoyed by a likely interim trade deal with China in early January  solid economic data and a dovish Fed  the S P 500 Index is set to return the highest since 1997  The benchmark index is recording fresh highs almost regularly in December    S P 500 on the Verge of Touching a MilestoneOn Dec 27  the S P 500 Index achieved a new record high after closing at 3 240 02  Year to date  the broad market index has rallied almost 29 3   It is currently at a striking distance to surpass its annual return of 29 6  posted in 2013  Notably  so far  2013 marked the best annual return for the S P 500 Index since 1997  when it jumped a little more than 31  At this stage  the possibility of the S P 500 Index crossing 29 6  returns this year is highly likely as two more trading days are still left  Moreover  this is the period of so called Santa rally  consisting of the last five trading days of one year and first two trading days of the next year  Historically  the benchmark index has returned 1 3  during Santa rally Moreover  the S P 500 Index is now firmly above its psychological barrier of the 3 000 mark  The index touched 3 000 for the first time on Jul 10 and its first closing above 3 000 was recorded on Jul 12  This means that the index rallied around 8  in past five and half months  This performance is in sharp contrast with 2018 when the index plunged 6 24  for the year as a whole  The S P 500 ended 2018 at 2 506 85 and the 3 000 mark was nowhere near sight Will S P 500 s Bull Run Continue The three positive factors mentioned in the first paragraph are the major catalysts for the index  As per a recent CNBC survey  analysts are projecting an average 3 320 for the S P Index by the end of 2020  Notably  2020 will be the year of presidential elections  Historically  the index provided 6 3  annual returns in presidential election years and was up 78  of the time The biggest driver for the S P 500 s rebound in 2019 is the technology sector  which has skyrocketed 48 3  year to date  well above the index s gain of 29 3   A trade deal with China will benefit the technology sector the most  China is the largest market for the high tech products of U S  companies At the same time  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  Moreover  clinching an agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for the homegrown tech behemoths According to Mastercard  NYSE MA  SpendingPulse  retail sales in the United States from Nov 1 to Dec 24 of 2019 rose 3 4  year over year  This indicates strong spending by Americans  which constitute 70  of the country s GDP  Moreover  a turnaround in the U S  housing market and a likely bottoming out of the weakness in the U S  business spending are the other positives Additionally  a dovish Fed which has decided to maintain a stable monetary stance after reducing the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in the second half of 2019  influenced the S P 500 s record rally  Inflation stayed at 1 6   well below the centrals bank s targeted rate of 2  Our Top Picks  At this stage  it will be prudent to invest in the S P 500 stocks that popped in 2019 and still have strong upside left  Each of our picks carries a

Monday s Analyst Blog  4  War on Cash  Stocks to Win Big in 2020Lately  war on cash stocks or companies that focus on digital payments have been some of the biggest gainers  After all  we are all heading toward a cashless society  Physical forms of payments  including cash and personal checks have lost importance  and paved the way for debit and credit cards  digital wallets and mobile commerce platforms E commerce  in particular  has played a major role in increasing the demand for digital based payments  Especially  in emerging economies  billions of customers have flocked toward digital payment platforms for money management issues  Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu said that  e commerce is growing 5x as fast as face to face transactions  And in an e commerce transaction  the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as a face to face transaction  So  something growing 5x as fast where your propensity to be used is twice what it might have been  That s phenomenal  Another reason why customers are moving toward cashless payments is rise in mobile payments  This has revolutionized the way we spend  helping make contactless payment through smartphones  Needless to say  consumers nowadays are more willing than ever to use mobile devices to split a bill  pay back a friend or pay a babysitter So  how does mobile payment work  At a point of sale  especially at a supermarket checkout counter  smartphones use near field communication system to make payments without a debit credit card  During purchases  the mobile device sends the consumer s payment details through the Internet to the merchant s website or app  thus  making payments less complex  With the trend catching up  the mobile payment market is widely expected to touch  4 5 trillion in 2023 But war on cash has been occurring for several years   This is because it is cheaper to produce digital currency than paper  IRS can track digital income more easily compared to paper  The Fed too prefers digital currency  and most importantly corporates are making a lot of moolah from this global shift  With that in mind  here are the best performing war on cash stocks for 2020  MastercardMastercard Inc  provides transaction processing and other payment related products and services in the United States and internationally  Mastercard s over payment volumes are now up 14  over the last 12 month period

save the company  325 million annually in the next three years  At the same time  its operating cash flow has been increasing over the years  which provides room for investment Global Payments

189542,411058,MA,Will MasterCard  MA  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering MasterCard  MA   which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry 
This processor of debit and credit card payments has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 41  
For the last reported quarter  MasterCard came out with earnings of  2 15 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 01 per share  representing a surprise of 6 97   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 82 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 89 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 85  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for MasterCard lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
MasterCard currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 33   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 29  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-mastercard-ma-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200497368,200497368
189543,411059,MA,Better Buy  Mastercard vs  Visa,news,"If you can find a company with a toll road like business model  major potential for growth  and characteristics that cushion it from both inflation and macroeconomic downturns  well  that could be a dreamy business to invest in 
Allow me to present Visa and Mastercard 
They operate the two largest payments networks outside of China    the backbone infrastructure through which card based transactions take place  Their technology performs the authorization  clearance  and settlement functions of transactions between the banks that issue credit cards and the banks of the merchants that accept them 
Their two primary rivals are American Express  NYSE  AXP  and Discover  NYSE  DFS   but these smaller competitors also make money from issuing cards and lending  Visa and Mastercard  by contrast  are  pure plays  in the lower risk payments processing space  in which operators take a small percentage of every transaction processed over their networks  Visa and Mastercard also have wider global acceptance than the other two  giving each larger economies of scale and high margins  
In recent years  both Visa and Mastercard have greatly expanded their acceptance  international reach  and technological capabilities  cementing their leading positions in this four company oligopoly   But you were going to invest in just one of these two stocks today  which one should it be 

Financial characteristics
Though they have very similar capabilities and take rates  they do differ significantly in scale  Visa is currently almost twice the size of Mastercard on a payment volume basis  While that affords Visa higher margins  it also means that Mastercard has more potential to grow  

 Data source  Visa fiscal fourth quarter and Mastercard fiscal third quarter filings  Table by author 



Looking at their stats side by side gives one a sense of how similar they are  Mastercard is nearly half the size of Visa  but it s growing faster  In fact  Mastercard s transaction growth was 14 4  last quarter  while Visa s was only 6 6  on a constant currency basis   However  Visa appears to be doing a better job of monetizing its traffic and garnering revenue from other data processing services  which is why it has higher revenue per transaction and higher margins 
Valuation
As you can see below  neither company s shares are cheap right now  with both sporting very high P E ratios  However  the market appears to be giving Mastercard more credit for its faster transaction growth rate and its potential to outpace Visa in the years ahead  Mastercard s P E ratio is an extremely high 48 2 compared to Visa s P E of 38 8 

V PE Ratio data by YCharts

Thus  the market appears to be appropriately factoring Mastercard s better growth profile into its valuation  This makes the decision between the two companies more difficult 
Peering into the crystal ball
Looking ahead  investors may want to pay attention to how each company fares in their new  non retail growth businesses  such as business to business payments  person to person payments  and international remittances  Visa just made a big splash with its  5 3 billion purchase of Plaid  a start up that powers the movement of money across up and coming fintech apps such as Venmo   For its part  Mastercard made a slew of acquisitions in 2019 alone across data analytics  fraud detection  point of sale financing  and cross border payments  
What s the verdict 
In the end  both of these stocks appear to be fine options for investors who want to profit from the war on cash  Both have solid  entrenched positions that will benefit from the increasing number of credit  debit  and digital purchases being made worldwide  and both are also expanding into analytics and other payments related businesses  Mastercard may have greater appeal for growth investors due to its smaller size and higher growth rate  while more defensive investors may prefer Visa due to its larger size  higher margins  and lower valuation 
But quite honestly  I think it s a coin flip between them given each company s risk return profile  Fortunately  as an investor  you can just buy both stocks in equal amounts in order to play the strong secular trends in card and digital payments  which saves you from having to worry about whether you ve chosen the right one ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmswk,2067768

189558,411074,MA,Trade Deal  Retail Sales Help Fuel Optimism,opinion," Thursday Market Open  Christmas may be over  but that doesn t mean there s necessarily a lot happening on Wall Street today and tomorrow  In fact  the atmosphere might resemble an extended holiday  with many people still out and volume probably lighter than usual  Hours go back to normal  however  after a shortened session on Tuesday followed by the Wednesday market holiday 
There aren t any major earnings releases the rest of this week  and few next week  Economic data reports will be limited as well  but weekly jobless claims this morning could get a closer look because last week s 234 000 was well above what investors have been used to this year  The four week moving average going into this week was 224 000  up from 218 000 in early November  
This morning s data showed initial claims coming in right at a Briefing com consensus of 222 000  down from a slightly upwardly revised previous figure of 235 000  Continuing claims fell to 1 719 million from an upwardly revised 1 725 the prior week  
Christmas Eve featured quiet trading in a session that ended at 1 p m  ET  a couple of hours earlier than normal  The light price movement was definitely a big contrast to a year earlier  when the S P 500  SPX  plunged 2 4   It s up around 37  since then in one of the quickest and most impressive recoveries many investors probably have ever seen 
Consumer Strength Continues
Easing monetary policy by the Fed  low inflation  employment growth  and U S  consumer health  along with signs of the trade war easing  all helped contribute to this remarkable turnaround 
In another sign of consumer health  U S  retail sales grew 3 4  excluding automobiles  with online sales increasing 18 8   year over year from Nov  1 through Christmas Eve  according to Mastercard  NYSE MA  SpendingPulse  
The U S  consumer has been buoyed by a strong domestic jobs market  When people feel secure about their employment  they re more likely to be willing to spend money at the store  or increasingly at the computer 
Low Volumes  Low Volatility
Volatility has been low all week  as might be expected this time of year when things are quiet  The Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  has hovered above 12 after falling below that level last week  The dollar index  which had tested 97 earlier this month in a move that looked like it might be bullish for stocks  continued to hold its own  trading near 97 65 as of midday Tuesday 
From a sector standpoint  nothing really remarkable stood out Tuesday  but semiconductor stocks continued to look strong  The PHLX Semiconductor Sector  SOX  hit a new 2019 high  helped in part by Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD   which climbed 2  after a Wall Street firm raised its price target for the company 
We re in the traditional  Santa Claus  period for the market  which runs the last five trading days of the year through the first two trading days of January  Though nothing is guaranteed  this stretch often tends to be strong  That might help explain the lack of selling pressure earlier this week  Briefing com noted  However  it s also possible some of the enthusiasm got pulled forward into earlier this month  and lack of major catalysts could make it more challenging for gains to get extended

Flying Under the Radar  You could argue that Lockheed Martin  LMT  shares had recently been like one of the company s stealth aircraft  a bit hard to see in a market full of high fliers  The stock was stuck in a range of between roughly  370 and  390 a share for most of the Q4 after a steep ascent earlier in the year  However  shares went into a nice climb earlier this week  rising nearly 2  following a couple of bullish news developments  The company was awarded a  1 96 billion contract to build four multi mission surface combatants for Saudi Arabia  Defense News reported last Friday  In addition  LMT received a contract valued at  7 billion for sustainment of the F 22 fighter plane of the U S  Air Force  the Defense Department announced  LMT  whose shares fell back a bit Wednesday in light volume  might also have gotten a lift from the geopolitical situation as things flared up a little recently with more North Korean missile threats  When the going gets tough internationally  investors sometimes look for defense defense stocks  that is  
Why Risk It  While stocks remain near record highs  certain risk  metrics have gained ground  The 10 year yield  which moves in the opposite direction of the underlying Treasury product  fell back toward 1 9  on Christmas Eve  while gold climbed back above  1 500 an ounce for the first time since November  As we noted earlier this week  it looks like investors might be trying to have it both ways  with one foot on the playing field and one foot out of bounds  The continued risk off strength could reflect concerns about some weak U S  data Monday  with new home sales and durable goods both missing analysts  expectations 
Save on the Heating Bill  Spring like weather across the Eastern half of the country helped send natural gas futures   NG  down to their lowest levels since August this week  The commodity fell to around  2 185 per million British thermal units on Tuesday  and is down about 30  from a year ago as supplies remain abundant  That price is well below where  NG traded two decades ago as the 20th century ended  One question is whether the price can fall below  2  which hasn t happened since May 2016  As CNBC pointed out in an article earlier this month  almost every type of trade has worked on Wall Street this year  but natural gas is one of the few exceptions  If you were long  NG in 2019  the one consolation could be in your December home heating bill  which might be down substantially from a year ago  If you live in Alaska  however  forget that  Temperatures are supposed to fall to negative 40 in Fairbanks next week  according to The Weather Channel

189559,411075,MA,4 War on Cash Stocks To Win Big In 2020,opinion,Lately  war on cash stocks or companies that focus on digital payments have been some of the biggest gainers  After all  we are all heading toward a cashless society  Physical forms of payments  including cash and personal checks have lost importance  and paved the way for debit and credit cards  digital wallets and mobile commerce platforms E commerce  in particular  has played a major role in increasing the demand for digital based payments  Especially  in emerging economies  billions of customers have flocked toward digital payment platforms for money management issues  Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu said that  e commerce is growing 5x as fast as face to face transactions  And in an e commerce transaction  the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as a face to face transaction  So  something growing 5x as fast where your propensity to be used is twice what it might have been  That s phenomenal  Another reason why customers are moving toward cashless payments is rise in mobile payments  This has revolutionized the way we spend  helping make contactless payment through smartphones  Needless to say  consumers nowadays are more willing than ever to use mobile devices to split a bill  pay back a friend or pay a babysitter So  how does mobile payment work  At a point of sale  especially at a supermarket checkout counter  smartphones use near field communication system to make payments without a debit credit card  During purchases  the mobile device sends the consumer s payment details through the Internet to the merchant s website or app  thus  making payments less complex  With the trend catching up  the mobile payment market is widely expected to touch  4 5 trillion in 2023 But war on cash has been occurring for several years   This is because it is cheaper to produce digital currency than paper  IRS can track digital income more easily compared to paper  The Fed too prefers digital currency  and most importantly corporates are making a lot of moolah from this global shift  With that in mind  here are the best performing war on cash stocks for 2020  MastercardMastercard

unlike its rival Visa Inc s   NYSE V   54   In other words  Mastercard s payment volumes have picked up when it mattered the most for the company Mastercard s strategic acquisitions  alliances and

end of this year  Buoyed by a likely interim trade deal with China in early January  solid economic data and a dovish Fed  the S P 500 Index is set to return the highest since 1997  The benchmark index is recording fresh highs almost regularly in December    S P 500 on the Verge of Touching a MilestoneOn Dec 27  the S P 500 Index achieved a new record high after closing at 3 240 02  Year to date  the broad market index has rallied almost 29 3   It is currently at a striking distance to surpass its annual return of 29 6  posted in 2013  Notably  so far  2013 marked the best annual return for the S P 500 Index since 1997  when it jumped a little more than 31  At this stage  the possibility of the S P 500 Index crossing 29 6  returns this year is highly likely as two more trading days are still left  Moreover  this is the period of so called Santa rally  consisting of the last five trading days of one year and first two trading days of the next year  Historically  the benchmark index has returned 1 3  during Santa rally Moreover  the S P 500 Index is now firmly above its psychological barrier of the 3 000 mark  The index touched 3 000 for the first time on Jul 10 and its first closing above 3 000 was recorded on Jul 12  This means that the index rallied around 8  in past five and half months  This performance is in sharp contrast with 2018 when the index plunged 6 24  for the year as a whole  The S P 500 ended 2018 at 2 506 85 and the 3 000 mark was nowhere near sight Will S P 500 s Bull Run Continue The three positive factors mentioned in the first paragraph are the major catalysts for the index  As per a recent CNBC survey  analysts are projecting an average 3 320 for the S P Index by the end of 2020  Notably  2020 will be the year of presidential elections  Historically  the index provided 6 3  annual returns in presidential election years and was up 78  of the time The biggest driver for the S P 500 s rebound in 2019 is the technology sector  which has

Seeing returns like this can lead investors to  wrongly  assume that they ve missed the boat and the stock s best performance is behind it  While it s crazy to expect a 58  return every year  I still believe this stock is worth buying today  Here s why 

MA data by YCharts 
Hello  China
In a press release last year  Mastercard reminded investors it was committed to operating domestically in China  It s currently at a standstill in the application process  as it waits on Chinese regulators  But in a provision from the U S  China phase 1 trade deal  China agrees to process applications from financial institutions more quickly and must give a good reason for rejecting any applications  Considering that Mastercard already has operations in over 200 countries  it s hard to imagine how China can reject Mastercard much longer 

Gaining access to the world s second largest economy could be a great multiyear growth driver for Mastercard  China is already big into digital payments  with local options like Tencent s  OTC TCEHY  WeChat and Alibaba s  NYSE BABA  Alipay having a near monopoly on the market  These apps only just recently allowed international visitors to link a foreign credit card  and still present some friction for outsiders  Given China s place in the global economy  I wouldn t be surprised if Chinese individuals and businesses began migrating to more internationally standard payment options like Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard once available  
That assumes China begins approving applications  But international growth for Mastercard isn t dependent upon Chinese approval  Through three quarters in 2019  Mastercard s international revenue was 64  of total revenue  demonstrating an already large international presence 
Digging a little deeper  the two regions growing revenue fastest  in local currency  for Mastercard are Europe and Latin America  Some estimates show that 85  of Latin America s transactions are still cash based  as are 79  of transactions in Europe  by volume   Digital payments might seem like old news  but there s still a long way to go around the globe in the war on cash  providing a long tailwind for Mastercard  
Recent acquisitions
It s been a busy year for acquisitions in the financial sector  PayPal bought Honey Science in November 2019 for  4 billion  and Visa announced the acquisition of Plaid for  5 3 billion in January 2020  While Mastercard hasn t made a recent acquisition of this caliber  it s quietly been buying companies as well 

Cross border payments are an area of focus for Mastercard  which is why it acquired fintech company Transfast in 2019  Terms of the acquisition were undisclosed  but the company claims Transfast expands its reach to 90  of the world s bank accounts and allows peer to peer transactions cross border  much like PayPal s Xoom  Considering Mastercard s strong international presence  it s logical to invest in a network that bridges the gap between countries 
SessionM is another interesting acquisition by Mastercard in 2019  It s a consumer loyalty company already partnering with many businesses  including Fortune 500 companies  This acquisition reminds me of PayPal s Honey acquisition  PayPal benefits from this in several ways  one of which is gaining consumer data that can be leveraged on other PayPal platforms  Mastercard will be able to do the same with SessionM  fortifying its payments position among consumers 
A strong company worth owning
Recent developments like possibly gaining access to the Chinese market and acquisitions of Transfast and SessionM are exciting  But these developments aren t game changing in isolation  Rather  they are continued good positioning from a great company  It s what we ve come to expect from Mastercard 
Over the past five years  it has grown net revenue 74  and net income 106   Those are amazing results for a company as big as Mastercard  but value investors are understandably concerned  since the stock does trade at historically high P E  forward P E  and price to sales metrics

These investors might consider waiting for Mastercard s 2020 guidance  which should come when it reports fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on Jan  29  At the same time  Mastercard is a strong company riding the global war on cash trend and has many years of growth ahead  Waiting too long could be counterproductive  If the company continues guiding strong and hitting guidance  a major pullback may not come anytime soon ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plwpc,2066039

189603,411119,MA,Fed s Brainard  Facebook s Libra faces  core set  of regulatory hurdles,news," Reuters    U S  Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard launched a broadside against Facebook s Libra digital currency project on Wednesday  saying it faces a  core set of legal and regulatory challenges  including clarity about how it would be tied to some basket of underlying assets 
Facebook s concept of Libra as a  stablecoin    a digital currency linked to government backed money or other sound assets to avoid the wild fluctuations of pure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin   remains unproven  Brainard said  with an unclear set of rights for consumers 
 What would set Facebook s Libra apart  if it were to proceed  is the combination of an active user network representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private digital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies   Brainard said in remarks prepared for delivery at a conference in Frankfurt   Without requisite safeguards  stablecoin networks at global scale may put consumers at risk  
Her remarks suggest that Facebook s Libra project has yet to gain traction among key regulators  Intended as a consortium of companies that would back the digital currency with hard assets  Libra has suffered other setbacks with the withdrawal of major payments companies like Paypal  Mastercard  NYSE MA  and Visa  NYSE V  
Central banks globally are debating how to manage the advance of digital finance technology  particularly the distributed ledger systems used by bitcoin  Some analysts feel it is inevitable that central banks will ultimately issue digital currencies of their own 
With the potential to lower the cost and up the speed of transmitting money  Brainard said the technology does have advantages  But she said there are also  advantages associated with current arrangements  based on the issuance of physical cash 
Cryptocurrencies  she said  still must clear hurdles including the possibility of fraud and their use for activities like money laundering  Theft and fraud losses associated with cryptocurrencies are estimated to have more than doubled to around  4 4 billion in 2019 from  1 7 billion the year before  Brainard said 
 Given the stakes  any global payments network should be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching operations   she said ",2019-12-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/feds-brainard-facebooks-libra-faces-core-set-of-regulatory-hurdles-2043781,2043781

Shares of Mastercard  NYSE MA  gained 58 3  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  That compares to a return of 28 9  for the S P 500 index 
The payment processor continued to post stellar growth rates on the top and bottom line  Investors see a long runway of growth for Mastercard in the war on cash  The enthusiasm for the company s prospects translated into a steadily increasing price to earnings  P E  ratio for the shares as the year progressed  
About half of the stock s return last year can be attributed to a higher P E ratio  Mastercard stock started the year trading for an earnings multiple in the low 30s but ended the year at a P E of 44  

So what
Mastercard continued to expand relationships with existing bank and fintech partners  which is part of its strategy to cast a wide net for new cardholders  All the important metrics    switched transactions  or the number of transactions processed   cross border volume  and cards outstanding    increased at healthy rates last year  
In the third quarter  the company processed 20  more transactions than the year before  That translated to an increase in revenue and adjusted  non GAAP  earnings of 16  and 23   respectively  on a currency neutral basis  
Now what
Strong holiday sales should translate to another solid quarter when Mastercard reports fourth quarter earnings  Analysts expect revenue and adjusted earnings to be up 15 4  and 20 6  year over year  respectively  in the holiday quarter

189628,411144,MA,Revolut plans to raise  500 million next year to fund global expansion,news,"By Anshuman Daga and Alun John
SINGAPORE  Reuters    British based digital banking app Revolut is in talks with investors to raise at least  500 million next year to fund a global hiring spree as it expands in markets including the United States and Japan 
The company has shocked incumbent high street banks in its home market into upping their digital game  as customers embrace the Fintech s slicker apps  money management tools and attractive offers on foreign exchange 
 We want to raise at least  500 million in direct equity and potentially  maybe at a later stage  up to  1 billion in convertible  debt    its CEO and co founder Nikolay Storonsky told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday 
 We have done soft marketing with investors and we are continuing doing it  so hopefully in the next several months  we ll get it done   Storonsky said of the fund raising 
Revolut has grown at breakneck pace since its launch in 2015 and now boasts more than 8 million customers 
It is embarking on a global expansion that has seen it launch in the United States and Singapore this year and expand partnerships with payments firms Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA  
Storonsky said the start up was set to increase its staff to 5 000 by late next year from 1 800 currently 
 Right now  I would say 60 percent of my time is just spent on hiring   he said 
Revolut is hiring technology developers  data scientists  support staff  compliance experts and also senior executives for management positions 
Storonsky said Revolut is in discussions with late stage growth funds and private equity investors  including those global investors who can write cheques for at least  50  100 million

189631,411147,MA,Nigeria s SecureID taps into Africa s move from cash to plastic,news,"By Libby George
LAGOS  Reuters    Sub Saharan Africa lags other regions such as Asia in moving away from cash to plastic money  One Nigerian company is aiming to close that gap by tapping into a growing appetite for smartcards across the continent 
SecureID makes bank cards  mobile phone SIMs and voting cards for businesses in 21 African countries  to address an acute need for secure electronic cards carrying sensitive data  particularly in the banking sector 
In sub Saharan Africa  only 43  of people aged above 15 have a bank account  according to the World Bank s Global Findex Database  That figure has grown from 34  since 2014  highlighting the potential for growth 
Nigeria s central bank has implemented policies aimed at encouraging a move away from cash  as have Ghana  Kenya and Rwanda  in large part motivated by efforts to tackle fraud  theft and money laundering 
Kofo Akinkugbe  who 14 years ago founded SecureID which produces 200 million cards each year  said more African companies should use manufacturing to harness business opportunities arising from technological advances 
 That is what I think the entire continent should focus on   she said  noting the continent is effectively a technology consumer  rather than producer 
 The potentials are enormous for it   said Akinkugbe  who previously worked in banking  at the company s site in a nondescript building in Nigeria s commercial capital Lagos  She  however  would not be drawn into giving an estimate of the potential size of Africa s smartcard market 
The company declined to disclose details of its sales figures or provide a forecast for demand 
SecureID started by importing bank cards before certification from Visa  NYSE V   Mastercard  NYSE MA  and Verve to make cards around two years after the company was set up  She said it previously took months for imported cards to arrive from Asia and Europe and now takes 12 24 hours to deliver specific orders 
Akinkugbe said she believed there was a gap in other African markets for the manufacturing of smartcards 
 We feel that the same gap that we saw 12 years ago in Nigeria is the same gap that seems to exist in other African countries   she said   The people can be trained and have the potential to do much more  
But manufacturing accounts for just under 8  of Nigeria s GDP  according to the World Bank  dwarfed by services at 52  and agriculture at 21   High tech exports from Nigeria  which relies on oil for 90  of foreign exchange  account for less than 2  of the total 
And  as in many African countries  poor infrastructure makes it difficult for manufacturers to operate in Nigeria

189651,411167,MA,Facebook s Zuckerberg grilled in U S  Congress on digital currency  privacy  elections,news,"By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters     Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB  CEO Mark Zuckerberg conceded on Wednesday that the company s planned digital currency Libra was a  risky project   but sought to reassure skeptical U S  lawmakers that it could lower the cost of electronic payments and open up the global financial system to more people  Sporting a suit and tie  Zuckerberg also fended off aggressive questions on election interference  free speech  hate groups and fake news from members of the U S  House of Representatives Financial Services Committee   Representative Maxine Waters  the panel s fiery Democratic chair  quizzed Zuckerberg on Facebook s steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020 U S  presidential election  She also suggested policymakers should consider breaking up Facebook   Waters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch  and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financial services    It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project   Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting U S  voters on its Instagram platform  BIPARTISAN CRITICISM Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation  and for data privacy lapses  Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its 2 4 billion users given the past scandals   Facebook s internal model was for a long time was  Move fast and break things   Mr  Zuckerberg  we do not want to break the international monetary system   said Representative Nydia Velazquez  a Democrat  Zuckerberg said Facebook would insist on U S  regulatory approval before launching Libra  which is being established by a Switzerland based consortium including venture capital firms and nonprofits  He said Facebook would even leave the Libra Association if other companies sought to launch the currency without that sign off  Libra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system  Several financial partners including Mastercard  NYSE MA   Visa  NYSE V   PayPal and eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  have abandoned the project    Representative Ann Wagner  a Republican  pressed Zuckerberg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort   You ve lost these stable partners and I find it highly concerning   she said   Why do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you re up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards   The 35 year old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a  risky project  and that he was not sure it would even work  During his testimony  the price of bitcoin versus the U S  dollar tumbled to a five month low   FACEBOOK HAS  WORK TO DO  Calm and composed  Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without major slip ups and was even afforded a gentle rib by Democratic Representative Katie Porter  who complimented him on his short haircut   The CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica s misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016 U S  presidential election   On Wednesday  he acknowledged Facebook s mistakes  saying he understood the social media giant was not the  ideal messenger  for the Libra project and that the company has  work to do to build trust   But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra  based in Switzerland   The vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message   Zuckerberg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project  sometimes to the frustration of lawmakers  On Oct  14  the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed  as required by Swiss law  Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group s governing council  meaning Facebook will not call the shots  Lawmakers also touched on other hot button issues  including diversity  inclusion  and charges brought by the housing regulator in March  still pending  alleging Facebook violated fair lending laws  Representative Joyce Beatty  a Democrat  hammered Zuckerberg  saying she viewed Facebook s efforts to address civil rights abuses as insufficient  calling them  appalling and disgusting   Some Republicans did offer support for Zuckerberg and the Libra project  arguing the government should not stop the private sector from innovating  
 I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech   said Representative Patrick McHenry  the top Republican on the panel   But if history has taught us anything  it s better to be on the side of American innovation ",2019-10-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/zuckerberg-faces-grilling-on-facebooks-ambitious-digital-currency-plans-2002016,2002016

189654,411170,MA,Alarmed by Libra  EU to look into issuing public digital currency  draft,news,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS  Reuters    The European Central Bank should consider issuing a public digital currency  an EU draft document said  after plans by Facebook  NASDAQ FB  to introduce a private one met with a hostile response from global regulators 
The social media firm said in June it planned to launch its Libra digital currency next year  But France and Germany said in September it posed risks to the financial sector  and backed developing a public alternative 
The draft European Union text  seen by Reuters on Tuesday  also urges the bloc to develop a common approach to cryptocurrencies  including possibly banning projects deemed too high risk 
In its current form  the document   which could be adopted by EU finance ministers next month   would escalate an EU regulatory campaign against cryptocurrencies  which have so far been only partly regulated in some EU states 
 The ECB and other EU central banks could usefully explore the opportunities as well as challenges of issuing central bank digital currencies including by considering concrete steps to this effect   said the draft  prepared by the Finnish EU presidency and subject to possible amendments 
Digital currencies like Libra   also known as stablecoins   are usually backed by traditional money and other securities  while crypto coins like bitcoin are not  Both are cryptocurrencies 
The draft text could be discussed by EU finance ministers on Friday  according to the agenda for that meeting  with a view to its adoption at their next gathering on Dec  5 
 STEPPED UP  THINKING
ECB board member Benoit Coeure said in September the bank should  step up  its thinking on a public digital currency 
An ECB official said that  in its most ambitious version  the project could allow consumers to use electronic cash  which would be directly deposited at the ECB  without need for bank accounts  financial intermediaries or clearing counterparties 
They are all needed now to process digital payments  but might no longer be if the ECB took over their functions  slashing transaction costs  But that raises technical challenges  and opposition from banks is likely 
Until Facebook launched its project in June  regulators had largely ignored stablecoins because of their tiny size  The largest  Tether  is far smaller than bitcoin 
But Libra s potentially huge reach   it could be used by billions of Facebook users   has spooked regulators 
As part of a global push against Libra  the G7 group of wealthy nations said last month that stablecoins should not be allowed to launch until international risks they posed were addressed 
Under regulatory pressure  Libra has lost a quarter of its original members  including payments firms Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA  
The EU document reiterates the G7 concerns over the risks that private currencies pose  citing money laundering  consumer protection  the functioning of payment systems  taxation and cyber security 
But in recommending an outright ban on risky projects and a move toward a public digital currency it goes further 
 At the very least  we need a robust regulatory framework to deal with virtual currencies   said Markus Ferber  a German conservative who leads on financial matters the largest EU Parliament grouping

LONDON  Reuters    The risks posed by cryptocurrencies such as Facebook s Libra must be addressed before any launch  a senior Bank of France official said on Tuesday  adding to a chorus of regulatory scepticism that threatens to derail the project 
Since Facebook  NASDAQ FB  announced its plans for Libra in June  politicians and regulators around the world have voiced concern about the project  saying it risked upsetting global financial stability  undermining users  privacy and enabling money laundering 
In the latest warning shot  Denis Beau  first deputy governor of the Bank of France  said the widespread use of such cryptocurrencies was fraught with peril 
 If they were to take off  they would raise additional issues in terms of competition  policy  financial stability and monetary policy   he told Reuters in an interview 
 It s really important that this is understood and the risks are addressed before any possible rollout  
The Libra Association  a body set up by Facebook to oversee the project  said on Monday that the cryptocurrency s launch  planned for June 2020  may be delayed because of regulatory hurdles  The comments came after a quarter of Libra s initial members  including major payments firms Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA   abandoned the project

His comments provide a rare ray of light for Facebook s cryptocurrency plans  which have been widely criticized by regulators and politicians since the social media group unveiled the currency in June 
 There is certainly no judgment that stablecoins shouldn t exist   Coeure told Bloomberg News 
European policymakers have voiced strong opposition to Libra  with France pledging to block its launch in Europe over worries about its impact of financial stability and its potential to undermine monetary sovereignty 
But Coeure  who is French  was more constructive 
 In the case of Europe  neither the Commission nor the ECB intend to make Europe a no fly zone for stablecoins  But stablecoins will have to meet the highest regulatory standards and adhere to broader public policy goals   he said 
Libra s backers pledged to forge ahead with the project on Monday  shrugging off the defection of seven of its founding members  including major payments firms Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA   amid the regulatory criticism

189698,411214,MA,Nordic banks agree to fund common payment service,news,"By Colm Fulton
STOCKHOLM  Reuters    Six of the Nordic region s biggest banks have agreed to invest in pan Nordic instant payment system P27  aiming to integrate payment services in the region into a single platform to help boost business 
The platform would allow individuals and businesses to instantly send money from a mobile phone or corporate bank account to other countries in the region 
 P27 will become the world s first integrated domestic and cross border real time payments platform   said P27 s CEO Lars Sjogren  when the banks announced the deal on Tuesday  without saying how much they expected to invest 
A single payment system which transacts across borders and currencies in the region would make trade between Nordic countries easier  particularly as countries such as Sweden move increasingly away from cash 
The group of banks  which include Danske Bank  Nordea  Swedbank  Handelsbanken  SEB and OP  have agreed unconditionally to fund P27 until it starts to generate its own revenue  said Martin Georgzen  P27 s head of strategy and communication 
 The Nordic banking sector already has a leading position in Europe  and P27 will help further expand and consolidate this position   Sjorgren said 
He told Reuters a single system for real time payments was a vital step as trade between Nordic countries accounts for 25  of the region s total GDP 
 The Nordic countries are relatively small  so when we combine our markets we get a different scale and become much more attractive to partner with  This means we get better service for a lower price   said Sjogren 
Georgzen said P27 would generate its income by charging fees for using the service  Each fee is fixed depending on the size of the payment  he added 
Georgzen said he expected the payment service to be ready by the start of 2021  He added P27 must now obtain a payment clearing license in Sweden  where the company is headquartered 
P27  which was set up in May  will facilitate payments in and between Sweden  Denmark and Finland  but it will not initially include Norway 
In June  P27 announced it would work with U S payment service Mastercard  NYSE MA  to build its platform ",2019-10-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/nordic-banks-agree-to-fund-common-payment-service-1993755,1993755

189712,411228,MA,Launch of Facebook s Libra could be delayed over regulatory concerns  executive,news,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
GENEVA  Reuters    The launch of Facebook s Libra could be pushed back to tackle the regulatory concerns that have been raised around the world  the head of the organization set up to oversee the cryptocurrency told Reuters 
Three months ago  Facebook  O FB  announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020  in partnership with other members of the Libra Association set up by the U S  tech giant to manage the project 
However the attempt to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream has since met with regulatory and political skepticism globally  with France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe 
Bertrand Perez  managing director of the Geneva based Libra Association  said discussions were continuing with regulators from Europe and elsewhere to assuage concerns 
 When we  made  the announcement in June  that was our North Star   Perez said of the June 2020 launch date  adding that a delay of one or two quarters would not be an issue 
 What is important is that we need to comply with the regulators and we need to make sure that they are on board with us and fully comfortable with our solutions  
 We knew that we would have to answer lots of questions coming from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic  and from other parts of the world   he added in an interview at the United Nations offices in Geneva 
Libra  announced as Facebook expands into e commerce  will be backed by a reserve of real world assets  including bank deposits and short term government securities  and overseen by the 28 member association 
The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments 
Last week David Marcus  the executive leading the project at Facebook  said the company still aimed to launch the digital currency in 2020 
 The goal is still to launch Libra next year   he told Swiss newspaper NZZ   Until then  we ll need to address all questions adequately  create a suitable regulatory environment  
The association has thus far taken a backseat to Facebook in visibility on the project  but Perez stressed it was independent of the social media giant  which will have an equal vote as other members in the association s decision making 
Other members of the association include  Vodafone   L VOD   PayPal  O PYPL   Mastercard  N MA  and Visa  N V   and the group plans to bring more members on board in the near future  which it expects to include banks 
 It s known this project was incubated at Facebook and started at Facebook  but at an early stage  there was a decision that this should be a public good not controlled by a single entity   added Perez  a senior director of payments engineering for PayPal before starting at Libra this May

189769,411285,MA,Bitcoin Dips Below 200 Period MA Amid Libra Scepticism,opinion,"Bitcoin sank to five month lows on Wednesday  after congress grilled Facebook  NASDAQ FB  co founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the proposed Libra digital currency  Lawmakers expressed their skepticism and Mark Zuckerberg openly admitted that he did not know if Libra was going to work 
The House Financial Services Committee voiced concerns over Libra s potential impact on the financial system  user privacy and the danger of it being used for money laundering and criminal activities  Zuckerberg stated that Facebook would leave the nonprofit body governing Libra  if other members decided to proceed without regulatory approval 
During the hearing  United States Congressman Brad Sherman condemned cryptocurrencies in general  arguing 
 Cryptocurrency either doesn t work  in which case investors lose a lot of money  or it does achieve its objectives perhaps and displaces the US dollar or interferes with the US dollar being virtually the sole reserve currency in the world   
In support of Libra  Zuckerberg stressed that China is advancing rapidly with its own cryptocurrency payment system that may undermine the United States as the global financial leader 
He stated   China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months  and added   Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world  
In addition to the doubts of Congress  Libra suffered a setback earlier this month after financial giants including PayPal  Visa  NYSE V   Mastercard  NYSE MA   eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  and Stripe withdrew from the Libra Association   the nonprofit organization formed to oversee the digital currency s creation and rollout

189799,411315,MA,Mastercard  Visa  Could Anything Derail Their Powerful Rallies ,opinion,"Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  and Visa   NYSE V   the world s largest payment networks  have proved a great bet for their investors  Despite all the worries about global growth  trade wars  and volatility in the markets  their stocks have continued their upward journey  beating the broader market 
Shares of both companies have surged between 30  to 45  this year  while the S P 500 Index has gained 19   If you look at their performances over the longer horizon  the gains have been more stunning  Over the past five years  Mastercard has delivered about 260  return  while Visa has soared 223  





The growth stories of Visa and Mastercard have been impressive  Thanks to their market dominance and the continuing worldwide shift away from cash  both companies have been ideally positioned to benefit from the strong global economy  solid consumer spending in the U S  and a favorable credit environment 
For the second quarter  Mastercard reported a 12  growth in revenue  while Visa delivered a 15  increase compared with a year ago  Mastercard s revenue has grown more than 17  on average over the past eight quarters  according to FactSet 
With this kind of explosive growth  a logical question in investors  minds should be whether both payment masters will be able to continue with this growth journey  That concern has become more relevant  given growing signs of economic weakness outside the U S   coupled with the lingering trade war with China 
Bullish Future Expectations
Despite these concerns  the analysts  community is still quite bullish on the future  Of the 38 Wall Street analysts who cover Mastercard  35 recommend buying the stock  And for Visa  the number of buy calls is 34 out of 39 in total 
 There are few  if any  other stocks for which you can have a comparable level of conviction that the company will deliver  20  EPS growth  year in  year out  for at least the next five years   said Moffett Nathanson s analyst Lisa Ellis in a recent note to clients 
In the case of Mastercard  the sentiment turned more bullish in recent months after the company began spending heavily on acquisitions to unlock future growth and build out its digital capabilities 
Last month  the company agreed to buy a payments platform owned by Denmark based Nets for  3 19 billion  Earlier this year  the company bought Ethoca  which helps merchants identify fraud  and Vyze  a point of sale payment provider  The company also acquired Transactis  which helps with bill payments  and Transfast  a cross border payments network 
Visa  on the other hand  is consolidating its dominant position in the payment market through a series of acquisitions and partnerships 
Visa was intrinsically poised for success  said David Ritter  a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst in a report last month  The network offered the infrastructure for electronic payments just as digital commerce began to spark  and its middleman role in transactions gives high profit margins with low costs and risks 
 The big tailwind at its back is commerce going electronic   Ritter said in the report   They re just in a great business and very enviable position  
Bottom Line
Both Visa and Mastercard are benefiting from strong consumer spending  a cyclical shift from cash to credit and a persistent low interest rate environment which is fuelling consumer spending  That rally may continue if these conditions persist  but both stocks will not remain immune to a sharp slowdown in the economy  Any pullback in their share values should be taken as a buying opportunity by long term investors ",2019-09-23,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mastercard-visa-could-anything-derail-their-powerful-rallies-200466915,200466915

Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  7 61 per share and revenue of  16 81 billion  These totals would mark changes of  17 26  and  12 44   respectively  from last year 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for MA should also be noted by investors  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 02  higher  MA currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold

189801,411317,MA,Facebook s  FB  Libra Project In Question After PayPal  PYPL  Withdraws ,opinion,"The coalition Facebook   NASDAQ FB   formed to create its cryptocurrency project named Libra is starting to unravel   Facebook announced that they would be playing their hand in the cryptocurrency field  stating that they would be working with financial services companies like Visa   NYSE V    PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL    and others  The news of the social media giant s latest endeavor was initially received with acclaim from Wall Street as some analysts even went as far as to say that Facebook s new initiative could become a worldwide currency  However  as of late  the project has decelerated as questions surrounding the continued participation of the financial services companies have surfaced 
Project Libra Losing Steam 
A few days ago  news hit that Mastercard   NYSE MA   and other financial partners that agreed to help build and maintain project Libra s payment network were reconsidering their involvement in the project  The announcement comes on the heels of US and European countries taking more stringent measures against the development of the project  Bruno Le Maire  France s finance minister  said the Libra project would lead to  an eventual privatization of money  replacing weaker currencies in countries around the world and undermining states  sovereign independence  
The finance minister went on to comment that  These are serious concerns  and under these conditions  we can t authorize Libra s development on European soil   The financial companies who were signed on to help develop the project are now warry of attracting regulatory scrutiny  Major defections could hurt the project as Facebook s attempt to persuade consumers to swap their national currencies for a digital coin may become compromised  Regulatory scrutiny is the last thing Facebook needs as their reputation and practices have come under question as federal agencies investigate the company 
PayPal announced that they would be withdrawing themselves from project Libra  The financial services firm stated   PayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations   This is definitely not a good look for Facebook as they are now scrambling to keep the remaining financial companies on board 
Takeaway 
For the time being it seems that Project Libra is in trouble of falling out with more of its corporate backers as it continues to face scrutiny from regulators  Regulators have serious concerns about the privacy of the project as well as the financial stability of the potential currency  Facebook has already said that investors had nothing to worry about as the company wouldn t have unilateral control of the currency but to no avail  Wall Street will have its eyes set on how the matter unfolds in the coming days

189802,411318,MA,Crypto Enthusiasts Still On Board  The Tether Shows,opinion,"Bitcoin once again overcame the gravity of around  7 900 and attracted buyers  During the last 24 hours  along with the price increase by more than 4   trading volumes increased by almost 30   Bitcoin traded near  8 300 on Tuesday morning  However  it seems that the growth impulse is close to its exhaustion 





The altcoins duplicate the dynamics of bitcoin  adding 5    7  for the last day  However  taking into account shallow price levels  from which alternative cryptocurrencies have to start now  in their case the actual growth is rather modest  It is noteworthy that with the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market  a slight decrease demonstrates stablecoin Tether  USDT  
Crypto investors use Tether as a safe haven in a bid to survive the falling prices across the market  That polarisation is a good sign for the market  Money is not withdrawn from the cryptomarket  but is ready to return to the market very soon 





Also  on the example of USDT  we see a model of a real working project in the physical world  where people use it to speed up  reduce the cost and simplify the money transfer  Nobody cares about the backing of a digital asset if the transaction is fast and cheap  and there is no price volatility  However  for the global perspective  USDT does not have several essential components  a user base and ease of use at the level of  a few clicks  
Libra digital currency wants to enter the market with all these advantages  The fierce reaction of governments and central banks around the world suggests that the technology giant is right on target  It is gathering everything it needs to make virtually all existing cryptocurrencies meaningless and even challenging traditional currencies  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  has a vast customer base  a messenger  and the ability to include  send money  button in all its products 
Also  the company was able to attract the most notable brands to its consortium  which was a big mistake  PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL   Visa  NYSE V   Mastercard  NYSE MA   and many other companies are too large to take  innovation risks   Besides  they are very dependent on the goodwill of the regulators  One by one  there is news that big names are leaving or considering leaving the consortium  Hardly a question of planned sabotage  rather  no one expected such a negative assessment by central banks and governments  All these companies work directly with traditional markets  so they have succumbed to pressure 
At the same time  there is still hope  Next week  27 members of the association will meet in Geneva  and the results of this meeting may give a clearer picture of the future project  In its tweet  Facebook noted that some 1 500 companies had expressed their willingness to participate in the project  It should be understood that in addition to  too large to take risks  there are more flexible companies  It would be more logical for Libra to attract more flexible participants from the very beginning  perhaps from the crypto world  rather than from the market leaders of the early 2000s 
The world s central banks and the government reject the idea of actually putting monetary power in the hands of corporations  Nobody knows what kind of developments giant technology companies are engaged in  but everybody understands that they have the resources to do so  first and foremost  technical specialists  At this stage  Apple  Facebook  Telegram and others need the support of governments  but this won t last forever

189825,411341,MA,Libra  An Opportunity To Leapfrog Chinese Fintech,opinion,"Few things unite Democrats  the Trump administration  the Federal Reserve and even France s Finance Ministry like opposition to Facebook s FB   0 15  Libra  The principal grievances are that widespread use of Libra could instigate financial instability and further enable the illicit transactions of drug dealers and terrorists 
Virtually all this is disingenuous and reflects the insecurity of the political class 
Libra only would be created through purchases with dollars and other currencies that an association based in Switzerland would hold in reserve as bank deposits and high quality bonds 
Backed by Reserves

Libra would be backed by substantially more reserves than national currencies and be more stable in value than those currencies or Bitcoin  National currencies  including the dollar BUXX   0 11   fluctuate with business cycles  trade disputes and official intervention to gain competitive advantage  and Bitcoin s value is erratic and influenced by a handful of 
Instantaneous B2B  P2B and P2P transactions    would greatly ease cross border commerce  For example  actors in Nigeria and India could do business without cumbersome exchange rate and payment system transactions that impose friction and costs 

Whereas the IRS treats each transaction with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a discrete capital gain or loss event   substantially limiting their use for most everyday payments   it could drive payments through a record keeping platform at the association by treating those as ordinary purchases in foreign currency 
Existing banks and new institutions could take deposits and make loans denominated in Libra much as they now do in dollars  However  with proper Swiss and American regulation  those transactions and investments could be tracked as easily as those denominated in dollars and pose no more challenge to law enforcement than dollar based payments 
China s fintech industry is well ahead of the West  Through Alipay and its competitors  it has created a nearly cashless domestic economy 
It s a Shame

It is a travesty that Americans still must haul around the greenback   often used to enable tax dodging  grey market purchases   and pay 3  for the privilege of using credit cards  The former cheats ordinary taxpayers and the latter is a useless bankers  tax on economic growth that could be eliminated by electronic money and a reliable blockchain payments system 
Libra could provide such a system that is far less costly to run and susceptible to fraud than the current systems now run by Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA  for ordinary consumers and Citibank and SWIFT for cross border business transactions 
Similarly  Libra would provide a reliable currency and banking system in the Third World to poor folks and small businesses who are underserved and vulnerable to recklessly managed national currencies and unsafe local banks  Secure money and banking are a necessary foundation for economic development and would become accessible on cell phones 
Chinese Competition
Beijing has effectively frozen out foreign competitors to its domestic fintech market but so far  Alipay and others have enjoyed little success in the Third World  Penetration into offshore markets could accomplish a long coveted Communist Party goal   replacing the international prominence of the dollar with a yuan based alternative 

If widely adopted  Libra   whose backers include Visa  Mastercard and PayPal   could shut those doors forever 
If not  Chinese fintech could do the same in some jurisdictions outside China 
American  European and other Western regulators should require that the Libra Association and banks  credit card companies and other financial institutions make transactions trackable as the latter do now for those in national currencies 
Libra is an opportunity for the American financial industry to leapfrog Alipay and other Chinese fintech  provide much of the world with sorely needed reliable banking and simply make doing business in America and worldwide less expensive ",2019-09-16,Peter Morici,https://www.investing.com/analysis/libra-an-opportunity-to-leapfrog-chinese-fintech-200464856,200464856

189836,411352,MA,India says in talks with U S  on H 1B visas  no official word on limits,news,"By Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI  Reuters    India is in talks with the United States on H 1B work visas but has not heard anything official from Washington on capping such permits for Indians  the foreign ministry said on Thursday 
Reuters reported on Wednesday the United States had told India it was considering caps on H 1B work visas for countries that force foreign companies to store data locally  according to sources familiar with the matter 
Asked about the report during a news conference  foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said there had been no official communication from the United States on the issue 
 We have not heard anything officially from the U S  government  We continue to reiterate and engage with the U S  government on this matter   Kumar said  without elaborating 
News of the U S  plan to restrict H 1B visas comes days before a visit to India by U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  Disagreements between the countries over trade have resulted in tit for tat tariffs in recent weeks 
Two senior Indian officials said they were briefed last week on the U S  plan to cap the number of H 1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10  and 15  of the total number issued 
There is no country specific limit on the 85 000 H 1B work visas that the United States grants each year  and an estimated 70  of them go to Indians 
Indian IT stocks fell on Thursday following concern about any work visa curbs  Indian tech lobby group Nasscom said such a U S  plan would imply a  further crunch  for businesses in the United States getting skilled workers 
Sources said the U S  proposal was linked to a push by many governments for  data localization   in which a country places restrictions on data flows to gain better control over it  and curb the power of foreign firms  The plan  if implemented  would also apply to countries other than India  the sources said 
U S  firms have lobbied hard against data localization rules around the world 
India s data storage rules announced last year upset U S  payment companies such as Mastercard  NYSE MA  
India is also working on a broad data protection law that would impose strict rules for domestic processing of data it considers sensitive 
Kumar said the Indian government remained in talks with the United States on the issue of data localization 
The government would also take a decision on involvement of Chinese telecom giant Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co in 5G trials  based on India s economic and security interests  Kumar said 
The global roll out of 5G technology has been complicated by U S  sanctions against Huawei  U S  officials have lobbied allies not to use Huawei network equipment in their 5G networks 
The United States has stepped up pressure on its big trading partners since President Donald Trump took office 
Trump has made use of tariffs to punish trading partners like China  the European Union  Canada and Mexico  saying they flood the United States with cheap products and put up unfair economic barriers at home 
Kumar said the overall direction of ties with the United States was positive  Defense relations have expanded with the United States becoming one of India s top arms suppliers  replacing traditional partner Russia ",2019-06-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/india-says-in-talks-with-us-on-h1b-visas-no-official-word-on-limits-1902906,1902906
189837,411353,MA,India s RBI says foreign firms can process abroad  but must store data in India,news,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI  Reuters    Foreign payment firms such as Mastercard  NYSE MA  and Visa  NYSE V  can process transactions made in India outside of the country but the related data should be brought back for local storage within 24 hours  the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  said on Wednesday 
The announcement was made to clarify the central bank s directive in April last year that mandated foreign firms to store their payments data  only in India  for  unfettered supervisory access  
The RBI rules led to an aggressive lobbying effort from the United States government and American companies who said the directive would increase infrastructure costs and hurt firms  investment plans  A request to dilute the rules was declined last year  Reuters reported 
On Wednesday  the RBI stuck to its position but clarified that payment transactions can be processed outside the country if the companies so wish  The previous RBI directive was silent on whether data can be processed abroad or should only be done locally 
Still  even in cases where the transactions are processed abroad  the RBI said such data must be  deleted from the systems abroad and brought back to India  within 24 hours of payment processing 
 The clarity on processing  and the ability to do so overseas  is a welcome development  Although the clarifications do not ease the local only storage requirement   said Kriti Trehan  a partner specializing in technology law at the Law Offices of Panag   Babu 
Mastercard and Visa did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The RBI clarification comes days after India s commerce ministry  following a meeting with technology and payment companies  said the central bank would  look into  concerns raised by the industry 
The differences between American companies and India have further fueled trade tensions between New Delhi and Washington  On Wednesday  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to reduce these tensions  promising a renewed focus on negotiating better ties  but gave few specifics during a visit to the Indian capital 
India wants more stringent data storage rules so it can better access data and conduct investigations when the need arises 
Other than RBI s directive for payment companies  India has also drafted an overarching law on data storage which calls for all personal data determined to be critical to be processed locally ",2019-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/indias-rbi-says-foreign-firms-can-process-abroad-but-must-store-data-in-india-1908223,1908223

There are good reasons to think we could once again see some fiat currencies disappear  If so  what  something else  will be money in the future 

I can hear the chorus now  Fiat currencies come and go  but gold is forever  And now there is a drumbeat for cryptocurrencies 

Five years ago  I said that I expected to see a commodity backed cryptocurrency to eventually emerge and potentially become the currency of the future 

Facebook s  NASDAQ FB  recently announced Libra project may eventually be one  But at this point  it s really just an idea  and I am not convinced it is ready for primetime 
Trust Issues
Libra is Facebook s idea  but the company obviously aware it has public trust issues has assembled a consortium to manage the project 
This  Libra Association  currently has 28 members  They are mostly payment processors  tech and telecom providers  venture capital managers  and a few nonprofits  Facebook itself is represented by a newly formed subsidiary  Calibra 
Unlike Bitcoin  Libra won t be  mined  by solving math problems  It will be fully backed by financial assets  which the association says will consist of cash in various currencies  government bonds  and similar short term debt 
All will go into a  Libra Reserve  as users contribute money  and each Libra unit will be a share of that account  Its value will fluctuate against conventional currencies  but not by much  or so they hope  

How do you know the reserve assets are really there  This requires a lot of trust  something Facebook hasn t exactly earned from the public it supposedly serves  But Mastercard  NYSE MA  or Visa  NYSE V   Since most of us have at least one of their cards  we seem to trust them 
Another problem is that Facebook uses your data in unexpected ways most of us would never consent to if it specifically asked us  which it doesn t  Not to mention the large  profitable firm s seeming inability to securely store our data 
With this in mind  Mark Zuckerberg is making some gestures toward segregating Libra customer information from the Facebook social network  I m not sure it will be enough to satisfy the public  not to mention politicians and regulators around the globe 
Know Your Customer
Libra faces another challenge that may be even greater  Much of the  unbanked  economy likes being in the shadows 
People use cash and cryptocurrencies as part of tax evasion  fraud  crime  or terrorist plots  Facebook says it doesn t want to facilitate such activity  But how to stop it 
Regulators have forced the banking industry to adopt robust  know your customer  practices  You must identify yourself to open an account  Banks report any suspicious activity to the authorities  It is a pain for legitimate businesses and investors  but a necessary one 

US and European regulators may not demand that level of scrutiny from Libra  but they will certainly impose some requirements  There is no way they will let it turn into anything like Bitcoin 

Facebook has millions of fake accounts engaged in all sorts of less than honest activities 

That s core to its business model  actually  more eyeballs mean more revenue  The firm is beginning to police the audience more rigorously  but its sincerity is questionable at best 
So the Libra project s DNA  so to speak  tells it to a  collect lots of data b  not worry too much about its accuracy  and then c  use the data to make money  That is inconsistent with the way Libra will have to operate  if it is to do so legally  as Facebook and its partners say is their intent 
Security Issues

But say Libra implements whatever safeguards the various governments demand  That still leaves it holding a lot of sensitive  private information about people s assets  spending habits  travel  and more 

Can we a  trust Libra to keep the data out of Facebook s clutches  and b  trust Libra  Facebook  and whoever else is involved to protect it from cyberthieves 

Just look at all the data breaches that have occurred at large  supposedly sophisticated banks and other institutions that spent billions protecting their systems  Is Libra going to invest that kind of money on security  If so  where will it come from 
Where s the Money 

Libra itself intends to make revenue from the  float  on its assets  In theory  you will give your dollars or euros to Libra and they will convert it into a basket of currencies  banking assets  and so forth 

The organization will live off the interest  paying you nothing while  you hope  not using your information to its own benefit 

Let s go back to that stable coin concept  A basket of currencies is not very stable  Fortunately for me  my friends at Gavekal took the trouble to measure the stability of both the dollar and the IMF s Special Drawing Rights  SDR  

They found that for at least US dollar holders  the dollar would ve been more stable  It even works out that way for holders of the Indian rupee and other currencies   Of course  if you live in a country like Venezuela  Libra may be a godsend for you  if you can figure out how to get some

So  if Libra isn t going to pay me any interest and it s not really a great store of value  what s my motivation to  invest  
Tough Road Ahead

So  Libra has a tough row to hoe  We ll see how it goes  But the point remains  Fiat currencies aren t working so well  either  What would work better 

I continue to think a properly designed  well regulated commodity backed cryptocurrency is the best option  But it can only work if governments allow it  They don t need to ban alternative currencies  governments have many ways to render them impractical 

For instance  in the US  the IRS considers Bitcoin an  investment   Any change in its value between the time you acquire it and the time you spend it is a capital gain or loss 

Tracking that for every cup of coffee you buy would be a chore  Libra will likely face this same problem 

And speaking of taxes  the IRS accepts only dollars  You must have enough of them to pay your taxes 

Similarly  the government pays its millions of workers and contractors in dollars  Ditto Social Security and other benefits  An enormous part of the economy won t use any Libra like alternative money  This will further limit its growth 

Those barriers will fall eventually  but it won t be tomorrow  I think we will see a lot of experimentation in the next decade  New money is coming  We just don t know what it will be 
Throwing Down the Gauntlet

All that being said  I wouldn t bet against Libra actually making it  While I m a tad skeptical of our privacy in Facebook s hands  hundreds of millions if not billions of Millennials won t even think about it 

And if you are one of the major banks that has been working on a blockchain cryptocurrency  Many are doing so 

Facebook s just sounded the starting gun  And they are doing the banks the courtesy of running the regulatory gauntlet first  Will that give Facebook a first mover advantage  Hard to say 

Remember MySpace  Not all first movers are created equal ",2019-08-07,John Mauldin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/libra-is-nothing-more-than-a-nice-idea-200452256,200452256

189997,411513,MA,Exclusive  Mastercard lodged U S  protest over Modi s promotion of Indian card network,news,"By Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI  Reuters    Mastercard  N MA  told the United States government in June that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was using nationalism to promote the use of a domestic payments network  and New Delhi s protectionist policies were hurting foreign payment companies  a document seen by Reuters showed  Modi has in recent years backed India s homegrown payments network  RuPay   whose rise has broken the dominance of U S  payment giants such as Mastercard and Visa  N V   More than half of India s 1 billion debit and credit cards now go through the RuPay payment system  and that means companies such as Mastercard face an uphill task to expand rapidly in one of the world s biggest payments growth markets  Modi has publicly endorsed the indigenous card payment network  saying using RuPay was like serving the country as its transaction fee stays within India and could help build roads  schools and hospitals  In a written reference to Modi s stance  Mastercard told the Office of the United States Trade Representative  USTR  on June 21 that the prime minister  associated the use of RuPay cards with nationalism  claiming it serves as  kind of national service     The note  which was sent by a Mastercard Vice President for Global Public Policy  Sahra English  said that  while Modi s digital payments push was  commendable   the Indian government had adopted  a series of protectionist measures  to the detriment of global companies   U S  companies in India have been increasingly battling Modi s policies they perceive to be protectionist  This year  U S  technology companies have protested against an Indian law that would require them to store more data locally  raising their costs  The previously unreported note  which was seen by Reuters  shows the extent to which Modi s support for RuPay frustrated the Purchase  New York based company  which is the world s second largest payments processor   Increasing rhetoric from the prime minister and government mandates on promotion and preference for RuPay     continues to create market access issues for U S  payments technology companies   Mastercard said in the note   The Indian government s preferential treatment of RuPay coupled with fallacies on pricing must be discontinued   the company asked the U S  government to propose  In response to Reuters queries  Mastercard said in a statement it  fully supports  the Indian government s initiatives and is  deeply invested  in the country  The company did not comment on its USTR note and its executive Sahra English did not respond to questions  The USTR did not respond to a request for comment and it was not clear whether the U S  agency raised Mastercard s concerns with New Delhi  Visa did not respond to Reuters queries  There was no response to requests for comment from Modi s office  Mastercard  whose president and chief executive is India born Ajay Banga  has a planned investment outlay of  1 billion in its key Indian market for 2014 2019  With 2 000 people  India accounts for 14 percent of the global Mastercard workforce  the largest outside the United States  The company recruited a Bollywood actor this year for a campaign aimed at encouraging consumers in smaller cities to use debit cards more regularly as it seeks to grow in India  DIGITAL BOOST In November 2016  Modi started promoting the use of digital payments after replacing high value currency notes in an attempt to crack down on the black economy   That increased card usage  Indians in August clocked transactions worth  51 billion on debit and credit cards  nearly double the amount recorded in November 2016  according to data from the central bank  which does not provide separate usage statistics comparing Indian and foreign payment networks  Foreign card companies have also had to contend with a growing use of mobile wallets and state backed digital money transfer services  some of which Modi promoted   RuPay received a major boost due to Modi s so called financial inclusion program launched in 2014  which meant that all Indians opening a bank account for the first time were offered a RuPay card  not a Mastercard or Visa  The Indian card network was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India  NPCI   a group largely owned by state banks but which also counts private and foreign banks among its shareholders  It also oversees the payments services in India  In its note to the USTR  Mastercard said the government had mandated banks to support the NPCI directly and indirectly  making it the  sole beneficiary  of Modi s financial inclusion program  The NPCI acted both as  a quasi regulator and a competing payment network   Mastercard said  adding that this was  compounded by the government s open preference for RuPay with misleading statements and inaccurate information on pricing  despite Mastercard being priced lower than RuPay    Pricing refers to the fee paid by banks to payment processors such as Mastercard for card transactions  The company did not detail which specific statements it was referring to   The chief executive of the NPCI  Dilip Asbe  did not respond to a request for comment  At one point  RuPay levied a transaction fee which was half of that charged by Mastercard and Visa  one industry source said  but the U S  card companies reduced charges in recent months  The pricing and charges are not publicly available  Modi in June said foreign card companies take their transaction fees abroad and as  everyone cannot go to the border to protect the country  we can use RuPay card to serve the nation   
A month later  Mastercard issued a press statement which said the company gets only 15 20 percent of debit card transaction fees  while the rest stays  within the Indian economy   It did not name RuPay ",2018-11-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-mastercard-lodged-us-protest-over-modis-promotion-of-indian-card-network-1670369,1670369

190027,411543,MA,Bitcoin Surges  Mastercard Tries to Speed Up Crypto Payments,news,"Investing com   Bitcoin surged to a five week high on Wednesday  as Mastercard filed a patent to increase transaction speeds of alternative currencies 
Bitcoin was trading at  7 459 70  rising 10 16  on the Bitfinex exchange  as of 8 55 AM ET  12 55 GMT  
Mastercard  NYSE MA  is trying to find ways to speed up crypto transactions  according to a patent published on Tuesday 
 There is a need to improve on the storage and processing of transactions that utilize blockchain currencies   the patent stated 
 Conversely  traditional fiat payment transactions that are processed using payment networks often have processing times that are measured in nanoseconds   Therefore  many entities  particularly merchants  retailers  service providers  and other purveyors of goods and services  may be wary of accepting blockchain currency for products and participating in blockchain transactions  
The payment processing giant wants to make it easier for merchants and retailers to accept virtual coins by developing a new user account that would transfer digital currencies from one party to another using similar systems in place for fiat money 
It currently takes around 10 minutes for a blockchain based transaction to process  compared to the nanoseconds for fiat currency to go through  If successful  it could increase crypto payments among merchants 
Cryptocurrencies overall were higher after the news  The coin market cap of total market capitalization increased to  296 billion at the time of writing compared to  269 billion on Tuesday

190041,411557,MA,Exclusive  Brazil central bank looks to rein in fees on debit cards   sources,news,"By Carolina Mandl and Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO  Reuters    Brazil s central bank wants to regulate fees retailers must pay when customers swipe debit cards to boost the use of electronic payments and add to already enhanced consumer protections  three people with knowledge of the matter said 
In a Friday meeting at central bank offices in Sao Paulo including representatives of card companies and retailers  the regulator made clear its interest in capping fees that card processors charge retailers  according to two of the sources  who requested anonymity because the matter is not yet public 
Fees paid by retailers in debit card transactions are freely set in Brazil and usually range from 1 percent to 3 percent of transaction value  One source said retailers argued at the meeting that fees average around 0 6 percent of purchase values globally and a few cents per swipe in the United States 
The planned regulations are the latest example of the central bank using its powers as regulator of the financial system to seek consumer protections in an increasingly concentrated banking sector 
Lower transaction costs would also stimulate card penetration   a goal shared by banks  credit card processing firms and retailers seeking to reduce money laundering and violence against clients with cash 
Transactions using credit and debit cards amount to 29 percent of private consumption in Brazil  according to Abecs data  compared to as much as 85 percent in wealthier countries 
A reduction in swipe fees could weigh heavily on the revenue of credit card processing firms such as Cielo SA  SA CIEL3  and the credit card processing units of Ita  Unibanco Holding SA  SA ITUB4  and  Banco Santander   MC SAN  Brasil SA  SA SANB11  
The central bank  Cielo and Santander Brasil declined to comment  Ita  s card processing unit said in a statement that is  favorable to measures to increase card usage in the country  
According to the sources  the central bank sees the cap on rates encouraging card use and lowering prices to consumers  but credit card companies have resisted  arguing that retailers will simply fatten their profit margins if with savings from fees 
During the meeting  central bank representatives said they will work on a regulation over the next few months and review the breakdown of fees among credit card processing firms  banks and payment networks such as Mastercard Inc  N MA  and  Visa Inc   N V  
In the first nine months of 2017  debit card transactions in Brazil totaled 346 billion reais   107 billion   according to Abecs  a Brazilian card industry group 
The scrutiny of debit card fees follows new central bank regulations over the past year aimed at protecting consumers from Brazil s towering interest rates 
A year ago  the central bank restricted how long consumers are allowed to use revolving credit lines offered by credit card companies  Average interest rates on those lines fell from 430 percent annually to 220 percent after the regulation  according to central bank data  Debts are now automatically transferred to lower cost credit lines after one month 
Last week  responding to central bank pressure and months of talks  banks also delivered a proposal to change rules for overdraft credit  also one of the most expensive credit lines in Brazil  averaging 300 percent annual interest rate ",2018-01-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-brazil-central-bank-looks-to-rein-in-fees-on-debit-cards--sources-1143906,1143906

190046,411562,MA,U S  consumer watchdog s prepaid card rule survives Congress challenge,news,"By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    A major challenge to the U S  watchdog for consumer finances fizzled on Thursday  as Congress missed a deadline to repeal the agency s new rule on prepaid cards  Late last year  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule requiring greater disclosures and overdraft limits for the cards sold by companies such as Mastercard Inc   N MA  and Greendot and frequently used in place of paychecks  The timing made the rule eligible for Congress to repeal it under the Congressional Review Act  CRA   but lawmakers only had until Thursday to kill the regulation by passing a disapproval resolution in both chambers with simple majorities  Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia  one of the agency s biggest critics  had introduced a resolution that he tried to speed through his chamber  but congressional aides and advocacy groups said he could not gather enough votes  Perdue has repeatedly said the CFPB  created in the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law to protect individuals against fraud  oversteps its authority  Earlier this week he said he intends to keep up pressure on the agency   The resolution s failure indicates that future regulations from the CFPB  reviled by many Republicans  may have shots at survival  The agency is led by Democrat Richard Cordray  was created by former President Barack Obama  a Democrat  and was originally conceived by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren  a leader in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party  The CFPB was expected to soon finalize restrictions on the fine print in contracts known as  mandatory arbitration clauses  that require consumers to give up their rights to class action lawsuits as a condition of buying a service or product  But the rule s fate has been caught in limbo  Congress is expected to kill it swiftly with a CRA resolution once it is official  While the first half dozen CRA resolutions flew easily through Congress  repealing a wide spectrum of Obama era regulations  the final resolutions faced a tougher time  One limiting methane emissions from oil and gas production on public lands failed on Wednesday  All told  Congress killed 14 regulations since Feb  1

190047,411563,MA,U S   China reach deals on access for beef  financial services,news,By Ayesha Rascoe and Michael Martina WASHINGTON BEIJING  Reuters    The United States and China will expand trade in beef and chicken and increase access for financial firms  as part of a plan to reduce the massive U S  trade deficit with Beijing  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday  The deals are the first tangible results of the 100 days of trade talks that began last month after U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Florida to discuss cooperation between the world s two largest economies  The countries have agreed that China will allow U S  imports of beef by no later than July 16  By that same deadline  the United States said it would issue a proposed rule to allow Chinese cooked poultry to enter U S  markets  Ross told reporters at a briefing  Beijing also agreed to issue guidelines by then to allow U S  owned card payment services  to begin the licensing process  in a sector where China s UnionPay system has had a near monopoly  Foreign owned firms in China will also be able to provide credit rating services  The talks with China are latest in a series of actions since Trump took office in January aimed at remaking U S  international trade relations  Trump had pledged during his presidential campaign that he would stop trade practices by China and other countries that he deemed unfair to the United States  His tough talk had fueled fears of a potential trade war with Beijing   This will help us to bring down the deficit for sure   Ross said   You watch and you ll see   Ross said there should be an impact on China s trade surplus with the United States by the end of the year  The United States also signaled that it was eager to export more liquefied natural gas  LNG   saying China could negotiate any type of contract  including long term contracts  with U S  suppliers   It is unclear exactly how much these new deals will increase trade between the two countries    We believe that Sino U S  economic cooperation is the trend of the times      We will continue to move forward   Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told a Beijing press briefing on Friday  When asked if China U S  cooperation over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs had played a role in the outcomes of the talks  Zhu said   Economic issues should not be politicized    Trump said he had told Xi that Beijing would get a better trade deal if it worked to rein in North Korea  a statement Ross later rowed back on  saying the president did not intend to trade U S  jobs for help with Pyongyang    FULL AND PROMPT MARKET ACCESS   China had conditionally lifted its longstanding import ban on American beef last year  but few purchases have been made  The ban was imposed in 2003 due to a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE   or mad cow disease  in Washington state  China s Premier Li Keqiang  days after the Xi Trump summit  suggested that restoring U S  beef imports could be linked to a U S  opening for Chinese chicken exports   U S  credit card operators  Visa Inc   N V  and MasterCard Inc  N MA  have yet to be independently licensed to clear transactions in China  despite a 2012 WTO ruling mandating that Beijing open the sector  Visa said in an emailed statement that it looked forward to submitting an application for a bank card clearing institution license  which   once granted   would allow it to support economic development in China  Mastercard said   We welcome today s announcement and look forward to having full and prompt market access in China   U S  business groups had wanted the Trump administration to act against Beijing on market imbalances  but not push the two countries toward a trade war  Nonetheless  more vociferous complaints about Chinese market restrictions by American businesses lobbies have marked a shift from years past  when many companies eschewed the idea of forceful action by Washington for fear of retribution by China  Jacob Parker  vice president of China operations at the U S  China Business Council  said the outcomes addressed  some of the top concerns  of its members  and that the deadlines reinforced commitments made during the Xi Trump meeting that the talks would yield tangible results  But he said risks remained that Chinese regulators could drag out the licensing or approval process in newly opened sectors   Ker Gibbs  the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai  said the deal  while a good beginning  was not a breakthrough   Past foot dragging means we won t celebrate until these promises are executed   Gibbs said  calling the opening in the electronic payments market  mainly symbolic    This should have been done years ago when it would have made a difference  At this point the domestic players are well entrenched so foreign companies will have a hard time entering the China market   he said

190049,411565,MA,UK startup Curve launches  financial time travel ,news,"By Jemima Kelly and Anna Irrera
LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    A London based startup has joined up with Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  to launch a payment card that allows users to retroactively choose a different credit or debit card for a purchase they have already made  in what they called  financial time travel  
Starting Tuesday  Curve will offer customers the chance to  go back in time  and switch the card used for any given transaction for up to two weeks after the purchase  in what it said would be a world first 
The startup also said on Monday that it was planning to announce backing from two large international banks soon  but declined to provide more detailed information 
Curve  which has a patent pending for the new tool  provides customers one card that can aggregate all of their existing Mastercard and  Visa Inc   NYSE V  payment cards  Users can carry only the Curve card and switch between the cards they want to use for a purchase through a mobile phone app 
Founded in 2015  the startup is among a growing group of young companies that seek to make better use of digital technologies to make payments and banking products more user friendly 
The startup s chief executive  Shachar Bialick  said the new  time travel  functionality will give customers more time to chose the most convenient form of payment for a given transaction 
For example  users might have funds available in their current account days after a purchase paid for with a credit card   and would therefore prefer to switch the transaction to a debit card to avoid interest fees 
 The user can manage their cash flow much better   Bialick said   It s very hard to make the decision at the point of sale  
The functionality would also enable users to take better advantage of card rewards  he said 
While users would be able to switch cards  the change would happen within Curve s platform  so merchants would only see the original transaction and would not be charged card processing fees twice 
Rewards gained through the first purchase will be reversed if that card is changed  Curve said  Curve  which is still in  beta  testing mode  has already had more than 50 000 sign ups  with the cards having been used for over 50 million pounds   64 7 million  in transactions so far  It plans to fully launch this year

190050,411566,MA,UK fintech start up Revolut raises  66 million  adds bitcoin,news,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON  Reuters    The  global banking alternative  Revolut has raised  66 million in a fund raising round  the start up said on Wednesday  in the latest sign that London is so far weathering Brexit to remain a global financial technology center 
Led by Europe  and San Francisco based venture capital fund Index Ventures  the fund raising round was one of the biggest ever Series B rounds in Europe  It should provide some comfort to the British capitol as it jostles to hold onto its reputation as Europe s leading hub for the nascent fintech sector 
The investment dwarfs the 19 5 million pounds   25 million  raised by London based rival Monzo in its Series B round earlier this year 
Revolut  which has around 700 000 customers  over 400 000 of them based in Britain  provides payment cards that can be used abroad to pay for goods and services at the exchange rate used by banks anywhere that Mastercard  N MA  is accepted 
Other start ups  such as Monzo and Germany s N26  offer similar products  but Revolut says it is distinctive in offering interbank exchange rates  zero fee international money transfers  and in allowing customers to hold and exchange up to 16 different currencies in their app based accounts 
Revolut was set up in July 2015 by Russian born Nikolay Storonsky  who first moved to London in 2007 to work for Lehman Bros as a derivatives trader and later also worked for  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  
If he were starting the company now  as Britain heads out of the European Union  Storonsky would still choose London as its base  he said 
 I don t see any problems with Brexit   he told Reuters   London is much more international than anywhere else in Europe   and  in terms of regulation  it s a great place to be  
Some fintech firms are worried about losing  passporting  rights  which give companies licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other  But Storonsky  whose firm has a UK e money license  said if that happens it would only take a few months to get such a license for the rest of the EU 
Storonsky  34  said he wanted to set up a business that acted like a bank but had less bureaucracy 
 I just don t like banks   he said   They re so bureaucratic  with so many managers not really doing anything     If you fired 80 percent of bankers  nothing would change  
BITCOIN BET
Revolut also announced that it is adding digital currency bitcoin  to its app in response to high demand from customers  Users will now be able to hold  exchange  spend and transfer bitcoin the same way they use other currencies  Rival cryptocurrencies Ether and Litecoin will soon be added 
Revolut  whose license does not allow it to invest clients  money  gets revenue from commissions paid by merchants  from users who change more than 5000 euros   5 736  per month and from add ons such as insurance  which is provided by third parties through the app  It is not yet profitable  but that does not worry its founder 
 It s normal at this point for a start up   this is how billion dollar companies are being made now   Storonsky said 
The firm had intended on breaking even by November  but it now says that will take longer  because it is using the extra funding to expand the company into the United States and Asia 
Revolut also secured more money from London based Balderton Capital and Californian Ribbit Capital  The latest cash injection takes its total investment so far to  83 million  It will run a further  5 million crowdfunding campaign this month

190055,411571,MA,U S  business in China warms to possible Trump trade policy shake up,news,By Michael Martina and Matthew Miller BEIJING  Reuters     Reciprocity  has become the new buzzword in the U S  business community in China  with some industry leaders saying they would welcome a tougher approach from the Trump administration in opening up the markets of the world s second largest economy   It s a striking shift within the American community here  which had long lobbied Washington against taking more aggressive policies  fearing they could draw retribution from China s leaders  President Donald Trump s picks for Commerce Secretary and Trade Representative  Wilbur Ross and Robert Lighthizer  have in the past backed the reciprocity principle when it comes to China  that Beijing should provide the same access and benefits to American business in China that Washington gives the Chinese in the United States   Our membership has moved to some extent in that direction as well  in advocating a firmer posture with respect to China   said Lester Ross  chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China s policy committee   He made the remarks in January after the group issued a report that found over 60 percent of the chamber s members had  little or no confidence that the Chinese government is committed to opening markets further in the next three years   Many sectors of China s economy are either off limits or severely restricted to foreign investors   Foreign banks in China  for example  account for less than 2 percent of total assets  according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission   A 50 percent ownership cap for foreign life insurers  despite China s 2001 World Trade Organization commitments to lift it  has helped limit their market share to about 6 percent  China s Anbang Insurance Group   on the other hand  has spent more than  8 billion acquiring U S  assets  including the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Strategic Hotels   Resorts  It is still waiting for regulatory approval to buy U S  life insurer Fidelity   Guaranty Life  N FGL  for  1 6 billion    CHINA HAS OVERREACHED  The same imbalances can be seen in sectors such as automotives  payment cards and technology   China s Geely Holding Group  GEELY UL  bought Volvo from  Ford Motor Co    N F  in 2010  but foreign companies are required to set up joint ventures to assemble vehicles in China  often transferring technology in the process   While China s UnionPay has grown to become the world s largest payment card  according to the number of cards issued  U S  credit card operators Visa  N V  and MasterCard  N MA  have yet to be independently licensed to clear transactions in China  despite a 2012 WTO ruling mandating that Beijing open the sector   Foreign technology hardware and service providers are bristling at requirements to meet the restrictive terms of newly minted cyber security regulations  Beijing s  Made in China 2025  plan also calls for a progressive increase in domestic parts used in priority sectors  such as advanced information technology and robotics to 70 percent by 2025  James McGregor  Chairman of APCO Worldwide  Greater China  said the idea of some form of reciprocity is gaining traction  particularly in combating  techno nationalism    You ve got Chinese companies that have protected markets and make loads of money and then they are going out and doing international acquisitions that could destroy other companies   McGregor said   Now China has overreached so much they have alienated much of the business community   McGregor said U S  policy makers had to figure out how to use America s openness and rule of law to deal with China  instead of allowing them to become vulnerabilities  The question is how to craft a reciprocity policy without destabilizing bilateral relations or triggering a retaliatory backlash against U S  businesses in China  Chinese state media has warned that U S  businesses could be targets in any trade war that Trump may unleash   he has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on Chinese goods  China s Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment on the issue of reciprocity  But Tu Xinquan  a trade expert at Beijing s University of International Business and Economics  said Trump s options would be limited by his promises to create jobs   If you close the door to Chinese investments  that s not good for American employment   Tu said   BAD POLICY One way to achieve reciprocity would be to use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  security review process to wall off industries where U S  businesses face discrimination in China  But most experts see that as straying too far from the free market orthodoxy that has drawn investment and jobs to the United States for decades  James Zimmerman  a Beijing based lawyer with Sheppard Mullin and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China  said strict reciprocity would be bad policy and against the U S  system of open investment   We need to be very careful what we ask for   Zimmerman said  Proponents argue reciprocity does not violate free market principles  but is a needed intervention due to a market failure  much as the government uses antitrust policy to crack down on cartels  Thilo Hanemann  in a Rhodium Group report to the U S  China Economic and Security Review Commission  said simple calls for reciprocity are  misguided   But  he added  if China s  commingling of commercial and political motives is not resolved  then a new chapter in U S    and global   competition policy activism may be required

Prior to today s trading  shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had gained 2 83  over the past month  This has outpaced the Business Services sector s loss of 1 14  and the S P 500 s loss of 5 09  in that time 
MA will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  In that report  analysts expect MA to post earnings of  1 82 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 9 64   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  4 10 billion  up 11 81  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  7 60 per share and revenue of  16 78 billion  These totals would mark changes of  17 1  and  12 22   respectively  from last year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MA  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 13  higher  MA is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

190091,411607,MA,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy MasterCard  MA  Now,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
MasterCard  MA  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this processor of debit and credit card payments a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for MasterCard is 17 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 11 4  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for MasterCard is 33 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 18 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 16  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 14 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for MasterCard  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
MasterCard has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

190092,411608,MA,MasterCard doubles card numbers in Middle East  Africa,news,"By Tom Arnold
DUBAI  Reuters    MasterCard Inc  N MA  has doubled the number of its cards to about 100 million in the Middle East and Africa in the past three years  where it has begun setting up partnerships with governments to provide access to its payments system 
That is still a small share of MasterCard s around 2 2 billion cards in use globally  But there is plenty of room for growth in a region where about 90 percent of transactions are still done in cash  compared with an average of 85 percent globally 
 This is the fastest growing region   Michael Miebach  president  Middle East and Africa for MasterCard worldwide  told Reuters   We continue to expect growth above the global average  
In March  the world s second biggest debit and credit card company signed an agreement with the Egyptian government to issue digital identification cards with built in payment devices to 54 million Egyptians  enabling them to pay for government fees  mobile phone bills  shop purchases and other goods and services 
The scheme links consumers  identification cards with an existing payment platform on mobile phones 
MasterCard has a pilot of a similar plan with the government of Nigeria  which also has a low rate of  financial inclusion  
 We see in the Middle East as well as Africa a fairly high cash dominance  If you go to Nigeria it is about 94 percent cash  
MasterCard and larger rival  Visa Inc   N V  get more than 60 percent of revenues from outside the United States  Less than a third of MasterCard s come from Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa  PayPal  the payments arm of eBay  O EBAY   is also active in the region 
MasterCard s first quarter results  published last month  showed that purchase volumes in Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa rose by 15 2 percent  faster than the 11 8 percent figure for worldwide volumes 
The size of transactions in the region increased by 20 9 percent  versus a 15 percent rise globally 
Within the Middle East and Africa  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were among the fastest growing markets  Miebach said  In the UAE  robust spending by Chinese helped to offset weakness in transactions volumes by Europeans and Russians as a result of softness in the euro and rouble against the U S  dollar  he said 
Across the Middle East and Africa  business had been faster in debit cards than credit cards  with expansion also driven by popularity of prepaid cards  he said 
Last month  MasterCard did a deal with Premier Bank in Somalia to issue debit cards and install ATM machines in the country 

Miebach also said growth was strong in Sub Saharan Africa  supported by buoyant economies and people switching from cash to cards ",2015-05-08,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mastercard-doubles-card-numbers-in-middle-east,-africa-340884",340884

190094,411610,MA,MasterCard  MA  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects MasterCard  MA  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This processor of debit and credit card payments is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 3  
Revenues are expected to be  3 88 billion  up 8 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 04  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MasterCard 
For MasterCard  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 94  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MasterCard will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that MasterCard would post earnings of  1 53 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 55  delivering a surprise of  1 31  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
MasterCard doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mastercard-ma-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200409465,200409465

190101,411617,MA,Why MasterCard  MA  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider MasterCard  MA   This company  which is in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This processor of debit and credit card payments has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 63  
For the most recent quarter  MasterCard was expected to post earnings of  1 53 per share  but it reported  1 55 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 31   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 68 per share  while it actually produced  1 78 per share  a surprise of 5 95  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for MasterCard lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
MasterCard currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 02   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 30  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-03-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-mastercard-ma-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200402750,200402750

190104,411620,MA,Cryptomarket Unable To Return To Steady Growth,opinion,"At the beginning of the week  the cryptomarket showed a cautious rise  Bitcoin exceeded the level of  4 000  but further growth impulse did not receive proper development and cryptomarket started sell off  The benchmark bitcoin loses more than one per cent  closely approaching the  4K threshold  albeit  now from above  top altcoins demonstrate a more significant drawdown in the range of 2    4  
It is a matter of concern that Bitcoin did not receive a growth momentum after exceeding the threshold 4000  In the absence of rapid growth after taking an important level  market scepticism often increases  some bull speculators are the first to go out of purchases if the asset does not receive a growth momentum 

Positive moods on the markets have recently been based on the assumptions that some positive fundamental shifts are taking place  The only problem is that this happens much slower than crypto enthusiasts forecasted 
Since 2013  the number of companies that accept cryptocurrency as payment has increased more than sevenfold  although this is negligible to at least come close to the scale of Visa  NYSE V  or Mastercard  NYSE MA   Swedish online retailer Digitec Galaxus AG and a supplier of electronic components from Phoenix Avnet with a total annual turnover of more than   18 4 billion have become the last largest companies accepting Bitcoin 
Bad news came from the SEC  As part of the public comment  the application for Bitcoin ETF from VanEck and SolidX received only 7 letters  of which in 6 cases there were recommendations to reject the application  It is worth recalling that in September 2018  the application for the launch of Bitcoin ETF received more than 1 400 letters  of which the vast majority were positive  The current state of affairs is associated with a long period of stagnation 
However  the cryptocurrencies adaptation within the traditional financial market is still moving forward  Recently it became known that now the Nasdaq  Reuters and Bloomberg platforms will publish several cryptographic indices based on CoinMarketCap data  In addition  CoinMarketCap  in partnership with Flipside Crypto  created a new rating system  FCAS  which will allow a new level of assessment of the  state of health  for any cryptocurrency 
An expectation of recovery can also be seen in the growth of the bitcoin network hash rate  Apparently  the growth is related to launch of the new ASIC miners from Bitmain and some of the turned off ones are coming back   Hashrate   price  is still very tight peg for BTC  As for the graphics card mining  the F2Pool data indicate that their number has decreased by 5 million units since July 2018 to 8 million  Still  the most popular coin among GPU miners is Ethereum  but as the project approaches the transition to PoS mining  the situation in this direction will change not in favour of GPU chips

190105,411621,MA,Wait To Buy These 2 Stocks During A Pullback,opinion,"A common mistake that investors make is that if they think a company is good  they re willing to buy its stock at any price 
In reality  a stock can behave very differently than the underlying company if it is overvalued or undervalued relative to the company s fundamentals 
This can present investors with opportunities in the case of value stocks  where their stock prices are suppressed below their actual fundamentals  But it can also work against investors sometimes  especially for some growth stocks where enthusiasm may push the stock price up faster than the fundamentals 
A recent example where the stock price has outpaced fundamentals is Nike  NYSE NKE  

Chart Source  F A S T  Graphs
In these graphs  the black line is the actual share price  the blue line is the price it would be if it were at its historical average earnings multiple  and the orange line is an ideal bargain hunting price based on a more attractive multiple  generally around a PEG ratio of 1 
For a long time  Nike stock was fairly valued  Then in 2009 like most companies  its share price dropped deep below fundamentals  presenting an amazing buying opportunity  Since then  the stock has rebounded  and eventually outpaced fundamentals 
By 2015  the stock price had surged up way faster than company s fundamentals  earnings  cash flow  dividends  etc  were growing  The result is that the stock inevitably fell back down to where it should be  But over the past two years  the stock has once again surged up past its historical valuation  It trades for a higher price to adjusted earnings than most other times in modern history 
It s hard to say how long it will take for a stock to get back to appropriate earnings multiples  Sometimes it happens quickly  like in the case for Nike a few years ago  Other times the valuation anomaly can exist for years  Sometimes  instead of the stock price going down  it just stays flat for a while as fundamentals slowly catch up  This means investors receive a period of low flat returns for a while 
A second example is Visa  NYSE V  

Chart Source  F A S T  Graphs
Visa is an incredible company that is benefiting from the trend away from cash and towards credit cards and digital payment methods  Whether you pay with a physical card or an app that is linked to a card  Visa benefits either way 
Visa consistently generates double digit returns on invested capital  ROIC   has a great balance sheet  and a strong growth runway ahead  Their S P credit rating is a very strong  AA   
But like many great companies  the stock has outpaced company growth in recent years  I have a small position in Visa that I bought during that dip in late 2018  but I d need to see it closer to  120 to buy more  rather than buy at the current price over  150 
You ll find similar things with its competitors  including Mastercard  NYSE MA   Paypal  Square  NYSE SQ   and other companies that are benefiting from the tailwind of going cashless  Most of their fundamentals are great  but investors know that and have bid up the stock valuations to high levels 
It s Expensive Out There
Based on many metrics  such as price to sales  price to book  market cap to GDP  or cyclically adjusted price to earnings  the U S  stock market is pricey 
For example  the cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio  aka  Shiller PE  after the professor that popularized it  of the S P 500 is back over 30 this month  which is one of the highest levels in a century 

Chart Source  multpl com
Economic growth usually comes in cycles  and we ve enjoyed ten years without a recession 
It s easy for stock investors to become complacent and assume that things will keep going as they have recently  but smart investors need to look ahead 
Profit margins are at an all time high  and yet they tend to come down during periods of economic weakness  Corporate balance sheets are stretched with high levels of debt  although some companies like Visa and Nike have kept relatively clean financial positions 
By remaining diversified  and having some fresh powder to buy during dips and cashes  investors can potentially reduce their portfolio volatility and improve their annual returns

190118,411634,MA,PayPal Hits A Record High  Should Investors Cash Out ,opinion,"Payment processing giant PayPal Holdings  NASDAQ PYPL  has had a great run so far this year  Its shares have rallied more than 16  in the first two months of 2019  fueled by surging business volumes and the number of users 
The latest evidence of the strength of its platform came last month when the San Jose  Calif  based company reported a 13  jump in fourth quarter sales and predicted another 16  to 17  expansion for 2019 
With its shares emerging stronger after every correction during the past 52 weeks and propelling to new record highs  it makes sense for new investors to get excited about this fantastic growth play 

Riding The Power Of The Checkout Button
PayPal has pursued a smart growth strategy  combined with some valuable acquisitions and strategic moves over the past five years  To counter the growing competition in this very crowded space of digital payments  where disruptors are attacking from all fronts  PayPal decided to open up and made valuable alliances with the largest credit card issuers  Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA  
This strategic move in 2016 allowed consumers to seamlessly link their accounts with their credit and debit cards  while giving PayPal access to contactless payment technology 
During this period  PayPal also bought many companies that kept it at pace with the fast changing technology  After its highly successful 2014 acquisition of Venmo  which became very popular with tech savvy young consumers  PayPal bought Swedish small business platform iZettle last year for  2 2 billion as part of its push to expand globally and increase its presence in brick and mortar stores  Hyperwallet  which helps companies to send payments almost anywhere in the world  was another important transaction of the last year 
The biggest success that unlocked the future growth for PayPal came from its online checkout button that appears on vendors  websites  For buyers  it s a great convenience factor  removing the hassle of punching in card details and other information for every transaction 
According to an estimate by MoffettNathanson  that feature has become so popular that it alone produces about 85  of PayPal s revenue and attracts 50x the volume of its closest competitor  Amazon Pay  Merchants love to have this feature on their websites as the ease of transactions mean more sales for them 
Can The Growth Continue 
After gaining more than 20  during the past 12 months and more than 180  over the past five years  PayPal stock is trading very close to analysts  12 month consensus price target of  99 88  But that doesn t mean that this stock isn t offering further value to long term investors 
The online payment industry has a strong upside at a time when e commerce is gaining share everywhere  That s the reason analysts continue to forecast strong revenue growth for PayPal  more than 16  in this fiscal year and about 18  in 2020 
Some investors might not like the company s reliance on checkout button volumes  But that risk is going to fade away as the company s recent acquisitions start to diversify its revenue base  In the fourth quarter PayPal added 13 8 million net new active accounts  About 20   or 2 9 million  of them came from the acquisitions of Hyperwallet and iZettle 
Bottom Line
PayPal stock may not rise at the pace seen during the past five years  but the company is still very much in a growth phase  If you are looking to get some exposure to an important growth industry  PayPal can still provide value for those with a long term investing horizon ",2019-03-01,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paypal-hits-a-record-high-should-investors-cash-out-200393697,200393697

This processor of debit and credit card payments has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 22  
For the last reported quarter  MasterCard came out with earnings of  1 78 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 68 per share  representing a surprise of 5 95   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 53 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 66 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 50  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for MasterCard  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
MasterCard currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 45   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-mastercard-ma-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200379559,200379559

190139,411655,MA,MasterCard  MA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects MasterCard  MA  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This processor of debit and credit card payments is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  34 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 79 billion  up 14 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MasterCard 
For MasterCard  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 53  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MasterCard will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that MasterCard would post earnings of  1 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 78  delivering a surprise of  5 95  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
MasterCard doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mastercard-ma-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200378915,200378915

China s December trade surplus widened to  57 06 bln from a revised  41 86 bln in November  The larger trade surplus hides a significant deterioration  which many see as a further confirmation that the world s second largest economy hit the shoals in Q4  Exports  which the median forecast in the Bloomberg survey called for 2  increase fell by 4 4   This is a two year low  Imports were expected to have risen 4 5  and instead tumbled 7 6   Exports to the US rose 9 8  in November and plummeted to  3 8  in December  This looks like the unwinding of the effect of US front loading imports from China ahead of threatened tariffs  However  exports to rest of the world also fell  and this is seen as reflecting the global slowdown  The drop in imports appears to be a combination of weaker prices  e g   oil and semiconductors   and lower import volumes  e g   industrial commodities  
Some media reports played up the fact that despite a WTO ruling  China has not even acknowledged receiving applications from Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA   There does not appear to be a new development that brought this story to the front pages  However  it serves the interests of those who are pushing back against a reconciliation between the US and China  which seemed to be gaining momentum after the recent round of negotiations and plans for another set later this month  It illustrates the non tariff barriers to trade and the shortcomings of the enforcement of WTO decisions

Ahead of tomorrow vote in the UK House of Commons  Prime Minister May is warning that a defeat of the Withdrawal Bill  which seems like a foregone conclusion  would increase the chances that the UK does not leave the EU  She suggests that that is a more likely scenario that an exit with no deal  Although the UK does not have a written constitution  a defeat of the government tomorrow could very well spur a constitutional like struggle between the executive and legislative branches for dominance  The Tories cannot have another vote of confidence in May  but Parliament could  Judging from various market indicators  it appears a consensus has emerged that the UK will at first delay the end of March exit 
The Independent Greek Party withdrew from the ruling coalition in a dispute over the name of the nearby country  which adopted the name Republic of North Macedonia  Greek nationalism is offended by a country adopting the name of a Greek province  This forces the government into a confidence vote later this week  Wednesday   which it could lose  If there is to be an election in Greece  it most likely will come before the EU Parliament elections in late May  A national election was due in the fall in any event  and the center right New Democracy is ahead in the polls over Syriza

190151,411667,MA,Long Term Focus  Stability Amidst Volatility   ,opinion,"Last month turned out to be a memorable one for stock market investors  but unforgettable for many of the wrong reasons  Santa Claus left more dark coal than shiny gifts  judging by the  9 2  correction last month in the S P 500 index  making it the worst December since 1931  Overall  the damage for the year was much more palatable  down  6 2  for the 12 month period  This result contrasts with the  9 5  gain in 2016   19 4  gain in 2018  and  276 0  gain achieved since the March 2009 low

While there have been some signs of slowing growth in key areas like automobile and home sales  the overall economy has been doing quite well on the back of consumer spending  which accounts for upwards of 70  of our country s economic activity  see GDP chart below   In fact  recently released Mastercard  NYSE MA  consumer retail holiday spending data grew  5 1  to a record level exceeding  850 billion 
Corporations  which are also helping propel continued growth in our  20 trillion economy  are producing record profits  as you can see from the chart below  This  in turn  has led to an amazingly low unemployment rate of 3 7   the lowest jobless figure posted in 49 years

Overall  economic fundamentals may remain strong  but in the face of the positive data points  fears of an impending recession overpowered the good news last month  resulting in stock prices that are much more attractively valued right now  For example  if you are shopping at a department store  it s much more advantageous for the buyer to purchase items on sale versus paying full price  Or as the most successful investor of all time  Warren Buffett  famously notes   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful   And recently  investors have been very fearful  As you can see from the chart below  prices  as measured by the Price Earnings ratio  P E   are below the long term  multi decade average  This fact is even more relevant in light of the historically low inflation and interest rates  10 Year Treasury Note at 2 69    Unsurprisingly  during the 1970s and early 1980s  double digit interest rates and inflation were relatively high leading to low  single digit P E stock ratios over many years

190160,411676,MA,Some Thoughts On What Is Happening,opinion,"People do not just disagree on what should and will happen  but they disagree on what has happened  As William Faulkner instructed   The past is not dead  Actually  it s not even past   This is clear in the narratives about the sharp drop in equity markets 
It seems that the most common explanation places the onus on the Federal Reserve  Fed Chair Powell s was seemingly hawkish in early October  during a time when the Fed has just voted to hike rates  and the median Fed forecast confirmed its intention to lift rates three more times in 2019   He noted that monetary policy was still accommodative  despite the gradual hikes  and there was still some a long way to go to neutrality  Although there have been some explanation and softening of the words  according to this line of reasoning  the Fed repeated its error a week before Christmas by raise rates and signaling two  rather than three  more rate hikes were likely in 2019 
This narrative is too narrow  There are other important drivers that suggest a dramatically different explanation of what is happening  The US stock market rally through the September 21 peak was built on a narrow foundation  led by a handful of technology companies  Some disappointing earnings and guidance saw apparently saw some levered players start to de lever  A few of the leading multi strategy funds had dismal performances in November  leaving to further deleveraging 
Rising oil prices  which were part of the big macro play  reversed dramatically in early October  The Trump Administration s decision to grant six month exemptions from the embargo against Iran to some of its largest customers  This radically changed supply calculations  Many of the US market based inflation expectation measures seem to be driven to a large extent by the swings in the oil market  The precipitous decline in oil prices may have prompted sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East to sell equities  as they appeared to in Q1 2016 to fill budget shortfalls  Several large commodity funds were adversely impacted  which seemed to contribute to the downward spiral liquidity and participation 
The threat of protectionism and trade wars increased in saliency for investors throughout 2018  and yet most narratives of recent events leave out the December 3 self reference by the US President as  Tariff Man    In fact  on December 3  the S P gapped higher to test the upper end of a month and a half range  and that was it  Over the following 14 sessions  through Christmas Eve the S P 500 fell 16  
The main narrative wants us to believe that Powell s mistake boosts the chances of a recession  Former Treasury Secretary Summers suggested that before December s hike  the odds of a recession were a little less than 50  and now he puts them closer to 60   At the same time  the equity market recovery over the past two sessions is supposed to be linked to the fact that the President won t  couldn t   fire Powell  Surely the US economy is not so fragile  and our metrics not so precise as a 25 bp hike would push the US into a recession 
The US economy appears to be tracking between 2 4  2 7   according to the GDP models of the NY and Atlanta Fed respectively  as of a week ago  The news since has been mixed  but one thing that stands out is that the consumer seems unflappable  According to Mastercard  NYSE MA   holiday retail sales rose 5 1  year over year  the best in six years  The shutdown of parts of the Federal government is likely to shave growth  In the 1995 1996 shutdown  27 days in all   GDP was shaved by around 0 4   In 2013  the partial government closure  16 days  may have cost 0 1  of GDP  according to estimates 
Congress controls the purse strings  It is powerful  Some suggest  for example  that the Vietnam War had to end when Congress stopped funding it  The Republican Congress that had been critical of Obama s fiscal policy could not provide tax cuts and spending increases fast enough  This helped give the US economy  already in the latter parts of business expansion that was historically long in the tooth  a bit of a goose that allowed the Trump Administration to pursue a highly disruptive agenda  including an aggressive trade stance  
Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis  the Fed was on a path toward normalization of monetary policy  The sequence called for an end to the asset purchases  Then after a  considerable period  rates would gradually increase  After some time  the balance sheet would be reduced by ceasing to reinvest all of the proceeds of the maturing Treasury and Agency bonds  The strategy was set before Trump was elected and has continued  unabated  There has been great continuity from Bernanke to Yellen to Powell  By maintaining this course  the Fed did not monetize the Administration s fiscal or trade policy  To the contrary  the above trend growth may have boosted the Fed s confidence to lift rates as it has done 
The flattening of the yield curve is widely cited as a warning of an impending recession  However  there are two sets of mitigating factors  First  how can there be a discussion of the yield of the benchmark US 10 year yield without some discussion of the negative interest rates in Europe and Japan  Second is the role of US debt managers who are choosing to concentrate the issuance at the short end of the curve 
If President Trump s criticism of the central bank happened in nearly any other country  investors would exact a steep price  Yields would rise  Currency would sell off  This is what happened in several emerging market countries this year  In the US bonds have rallied  and the dollar remains firm 
What has changed over the past couple of days  The January 2000 Fed funds futures contract implies a yield of 2 39   The current effective average is 2 40   Further afield  the market is pricing in a rate cut in 2020  Signals from Washington have changed  The President is no longer  we are told  thinks he has the power to fire Powell  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin s publicized talks with banks  about liquidity  and regulators  about market functioning  may have not been handled well and but reports of his possible dismissal has also been played down  On trade  the US will reportedly send a delegation  apparently coming mostly from Treasury to China in January

2018 was a phenomenal year for the U S  dollar  The trade weighted Dollar Index appreciated nearly 5  and is up more than 9  from its low in February  Emerging market currencies were hit the hardest by the dollar s rise but major currencies like the Australian dollar also lost 9 5  of its value  And now the good times are over  In the past 2 months we ve seen zero forward momentum  Instead  the tide has shifted with the dollar falling against all of the major currencies  As 2019 begins  the big question is whether the greenback will unwind all of its 2018 gains  That s a tall order but pairs like USD JPY were down for the year and many are not far from their beginning of 2018 levels  Either way  2019 will be challenging for the U S  economy and the U S  dollar as America s longest ever expansion comes to an end 
The bad news is that a number of factors will inhibit growth in 2019   volatility is rising  stocks are falling  borrowing costs are increasing  credit is tightening  housing is slowing and earnings growth is weakening  These trends  which are just beginning to emerge  will continue to dampen growth in the year ahead  Rising borrowing costs is a serious problem because it increases the cost of debt servicing for businesses at a time when share values are falling  The consequence is that businesses could cut back hiring and investment  Along with the tariffs  Chinese consumers are also reducing spending  which adds to the pressure on U S  businesses  2019 will also be a year filled with economic and political challenges in the U S  With the stimulus from tax cuts fading  the weakening economy  decline in stocks  rise in interest rates and a divided Congress will keep President Trump s hands tied 
None of this is good for the U S  dollar  The greenback was a big winner in 2018 because U S  growth led global expansion  but in 2019  the U S  slowdown could hamper global growth  USD JPY is the most vulnerable to a decline that could take the pair as far down as 105  
Micro
The good news is that while this could prevent meaningful legislation  it could also force Trump to secure market friendly wins like a trade deal with China  infrastructure reform or middle income tax cuts  The U S  economy is also slowing from strong levels  The unemployment rate is at a 48 year low and wages are growing at their fastest pace since 2009  Inflation is on target  gas prices are low and all of this translated into strong holiday spending  According to Mastercard  NYSE MA  Spendingpulse  between November 1 and December 24  retail sales rose 5 1   which is the strongest pace of growth in 6 years  This tells us that the sell off in stocks has not affected consumer demand and according to the table below  which tracks how the economy has changed over the past year  the housing market appears to be stabilizing after a difficult first half 
With that in mind  it is unrealistic to expect growth to continue at the same heady pace in the year ahead because as interest rates rise  stocks fall and businesses reduce spending  which means that wages and consumer demand will slow  Tighter financial conditions and fading stimulus will take a big bite out of growth in 2019  which will not only reduce the attractiveness of U S  assets and the greenback  but may encourage further reserve diversification out of U S  dollars  

Monetary Policy
Monetary policy could also pose a problem for the dollar in 2019  The Federal Reserve was the primary central bank raising interest rates last year but that will change as other countries move to normalize monetary policy more aggressively  At the beginning of 2018  the Fed said it would raise interest rates four times  This year  it is telegraphing somewhere between 2 to 3 rounds of tightening after expectations were downgraded this past December  Now  the Fed will still be raising interest rates in the first half of the year  which could lend support to the dollar but as the central bank makes it clear that less tightening is needed  the greenback will flounder  At its last meeting  Fed Chairman Powell told us that no future rate decisions are predetermined and everything is data dependent  This tells us that if the economy continues to slow  the Fed will delay raising interest rates  If it were to stabilize and start to turn upward  the central bank will be inclined to move more quickly  Still  as things stand currently  the Fed will be more conservative than aggressive with rate hikes  There s opportunity in the gap between Fed guidance and market expectations  At the start of the year  Fed fund futures are pricing in no hike in 2019  The dollar has only started to fall  which means market positioning hasn t accounted for no tightening  The greenback will remain under pressure until data or the Fed chair gives investors a reason to believe that a rate hike is coming  which means there s also opportunity to the upside 
Since we believe that the Fed will raise interest rates in the first half of the year  dollar weakness in the early months could give way to a recovery as the Fed talks up the next hike  This will be followed by another leg lower when other central banks jump start their own tightening cycles ",2018-12-26,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-us-dollar-crumble-in-2019-200371103,200371103

So far  the Fed s policy tightening  renewed global growth worries  an oil price slump  widespread tech selloffs  heightened trade tensions between the United States and China  fears of peaking U S  economic growth  and finally the government shutdown dealt a blow to the market 
Against this backdrop  let s take a look at which factors brought life to Wall Street on Wednesday 
Record Holiday Shopping 
This holiday shopping season has come up as the best in six years  Total U S  retail sales  excluding automobiles  rose 5 1  year over year between Nov 1 and Dec 24    which tracks both online and in store spending with all forms of payment

Santa Claus Rally 
It is believed that a Santa Claus rally normally drives markets  this time of the year  Santa Claus rally refers to the jump in stock prices in the week between Christmas and New Year s Day  There are several factors behind this surge  including  tax considerations  happiness around Wall Street  people investing their Christmas bonuses and the fact that the pessimists are usually on vacation this week  as per  
According to Stock Trader s Almanac  there is normally  a short  sweet  respectable rally within the last five days of the year and the first two in January   There has been an average 1 3  gain since 1950 during this phase  and it has offered positive returns about 75  of the time since 1969   read    
Though the story this year was different at the start of December  investors probably have found the selloff overdone and placed bets on steady U S  economic growth  healthy corporate profits and the usual equity market momentum at this time of the year  Notably  consumer shares were among the best gainers with SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  ETF  and Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF   V XLY   gaining about 5 75  and 5 93  on Dec 26  respectively 
An Oil Price Jump 
Crude prices jumped from a 17 month low on Dec 26 with United States Oil  NYSE USO   and United States Brent Oil   AX BNO   gaining about 6 6  each   by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak boosted prices  Per the minister  oil prices would become more stable in the first half of 2019 thanks to the fresh output cut deal by the OPEC and some non OPEC countries  Energy companies  ETF Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE   was up 6 2  on Dec 26  read    
Cheaper Valuation 
After such steep selloffs in most of the fourth quarter  stocks are now trading at a much cheaper valuation  SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY    AX SPY    down 18 91  till Dec 25   SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average  NYSE DIA  ETF   V DIA    down 17 04  till Dec 25  and Invesco QQQ Trust   down 22 5  till Dec 25    all lost in double digits and investors dug in that cheaper valuation

Let s see what drove the Boxing Day gain 
Oil s Recent Gains
Oil ETFs United States Oil  NYSE USO   and United States Brent Oil   AX BNO   gained about 6 6  each on positive comments from the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak about the stability in the oil patch in the first six months of 2019  He sees higher oil prices early next year due to fresh output cut  Energy shares led a rally on price jump and Vanguard Energy ETF  NYSE XLE     added about 6 4  
It has been noticed lately that Dow Jones shares a deep relationship with oil price movement  Though the latest energy sector rally has spread optimism in the broader market as a whole  in most cases  on a particular day of oil surge  the spurt in the Dow Jones is steeper than that of the S P 500  or vice versa  read    
Rally Retail Shares 
There was a superb rally in retail shares as holiday shopping season has emergedas the best in six years  Total U S  retail sales  excluding automobiles  rose 5 1  year over year between Nov 1 and Dec 24    which tracks both online and in store spending with all forms of payment  As a result  the index shot up on economic euphoria  VanEck Vectors Retail ETF    V RTH    added 5 8  on Dec 26 read    
Cheaper Valuation 
Since the start of the fourth quarter  Wall Street has been on a tumultuous ride  Renewed global growth worries  no definite solution to U S  China trade tensions  constant volatility in the oil patch and a flattening yield curve in the United States which invoked recessionary fears at times weighed on the market  read    
Amid such market doldrums  Dow Jones suffered its worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008  tumbling about 6 9  in the Dec 17 21 timeframe  So  many investors decided to dig into the weaker valuation 
ETFs in Focus
Though we are not sure how long the rally will continue  investors intending a momentum play  can bet on DIA  Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF     up 4 0  on Dec 26  and iShares Dow Jones US ETF     up 5 03   
Investors can also settle for leveraged Dow ETF plays as long as the trend favors them  Here  ProShares Ultra Dow30  DDM   up 9 7  on Dec 26  and ProShares UltraPro Dow30  UDOW   up 14 4  on Dec 26 are a couple of choices

190195,411711,MA,Time To Cash In On Visa And Mastercard After Strong Run,opinion,"Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA   the world s largest payment networks  have done a great job for their investors  Both stocks have hugely outperformed the benchmark indexes this year  riding successfully through the extreme volatility 
If you compare their performances over the past five years  the gains have been stunning  Shares of both companies have surged more than 150  during that period  compared with a 50  gain in the S P 500 Index 

The growth stories of Visa and Mastercard were very impressive  Thanks to their market dominance and the continuing worldwide shift away from cash  both companies were well positioned to benefit from strong global economy  solid consumer spending in the US and a favorable credit environment 

Visa ended its fiscal year with record profit and revenue  posting double digit increases in both the number of transactions and payments processed  Mastercard  in the latest quarter  reported a 33  jump in profit from the year ago period  beating analysts  expectations by a healthy margin 
But the next leg of their journey doesn t look that straightforward 
With growing signs of economic weakness outside the US  coupled with an escalating trade war with China  the macro environment won t be as conducive as it has been in 2018 for these giants 
The Stocks Will Take A Breather As Macro Environment Weakens
That uncertain outlook is already making investors nervous  with share prices underperforming in the recent market slump  Visa  for example  has fallen about 8  since its October intraday peak  Mastercard  which is more exposed to Europe  has gone through a correction  falling more than 12  since its October high 
In our view  both stocks will continue to underperform the market if macro headwinds gather pace and consumer spending takes a hit  Keeping these risks in mind  it s a prudent strategy for investors to book profit and move to the sidelines 
In addition to these macro uncertainties  both stocks also look expensive after the massive rally of the past five years  Visa and Mastercard are trading around 35x their 12 month trailing earnings  much higher than the 10 year average multiple for both companies 
That said  both companies are great stocks for long term investors who are looking for the right moment to enter the trade  Visa and Mastercard have about 90  of the global card network market share  They collect fees on every transaction that runs over their networks  That economic moat is unlikely to go away anytime soon  despite efforts by startups to grab some market share 
When it comes to rewarding investors  Mastercard and Visa have been quite attractive  Both companies pay regular dividends and have share buyback plans  Visa hiked its dividend last month by 19  to  0 25 a share 
Bottom Line
We like both Visa and Mastercard for long term investments  but their current valuations look pricey after their shares returned impressive gains in the current bull run  In our view  the timing is right to book profit and move to the sidelines and come back when their share values become more reasonable and in line with their historic earnings multiples ",2018-11-30,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/time-to-cash-in-on-visa-mastercard-after-strong-run-200363721,200363721

190225,411741,MA,2 Financial Stocks To Power Your Portfolio In This Rising Rate Environment,opinion,"Rising bond yields could signal that the decade old bull run in equity markets is close to peaking  That was the main trigger for the widespread sell off in US stocks last week  making it the worst 5 day period in a month 
Along with higher Treasury yields late last week the benchmark 10 year climbed to its highest level in seven years interest rates are set to push higher as well since the economic indicators show that the American is growing at a healthy pace  Unemployment is at its lowest in almost 50 years  wages are rising and the service industry is hitting records 
With the Fed set to tighten more aggressively in the coming months  risky assets are looking ever riskier  In this environment  financial sector shares could benefit  Two stocks to consider  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  and Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  
It s difficult to predict whether the downtrend will persist in the coming weeks given the stubborn nature of this bull market which has bounced back strongly from every correction this year  But if you re looking to find shelter in the segment of the market which actually thrives in a persistently high rate environment  look no further than these two financial stocks 
1  JPMorgan   Chase
Investing in financial stocks wasn t a popular trade in the past decade  especially after the Crisis of 2008 which was brought on by reckless lending practices  Despite this  whenever interest rates rise  banking stocks are generally among the key beneficiaries 
Higher interest rates mean banks are going to make more money on their credit products  including mortgages  credit lines  and savings accounts  Among top US banks  JPMorgan   Chase is a name we recommend when the economy is going strong and rates are headed higher 

JPMorgan s large  universal bank model makes it one of the most diversified lenders in the US  Its multinational presence as well as it s market leading position in many areas of the banking industry make it a much safer bet than many other peers  For example  when the economy is weak and credit demand is low  JPM can benefit from trading  asset management  or investment banking fees to make up for the profit loss 
The other reason to consider JPMorgan stock now is that it has a much stronger balance sheet today than it had 10 years ago  after meeting the stringent capital requirements by the Fed  Over the past 10 years  banks have more than doubled their capital  which is their main financial defense against losses 
JP Morgan Chase  which is currently trading at 114 62  is seeing profits surge on the back of the stronger economy and tax incentives offered by President Trump s administration  Earnings rose 18  in the second quarter and the lender is well on track to make  111 billion in revenue this year  and  34 billion in earnings 
2  Mastercard
Mastercard  NYSE MA   the second largest US payment processing company  is another clear winner if the central bank continues to hike interest rates 

Mastercard shares have surged more than 200  in the past five years  helped by strong consumer spending and the global shift in payments from paper to plastic  For companies like Mastercard  rising wages mean people will have more money to spend on goods and services 
US consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of the country s economic activity was on track to grow at about a 3 6  rate in the third quarter  close to the 3 8  pace set in the April June period 
In the most recent quarter  the credit card company s profit rose 33  to  1 57 billion  while net revenue rose 20  to  3 67 billion  Gross dollar volume for the company s credit  charge and debit programs rose 15 3  worldwide to  1 48 trillion  beating analyst expectations of  1 46 trillion 
Mastercard shares look attractive after a recent dip from a record high of  225 35  The stock is currently trading at  213 26 which is 5  below its record high  Analysts  on average  expect about an 8  jump in the share price during the next 12 months 
Bottom Line
It s better to focus on stocks which have a history of beating the market when interest rates climb  Both JPMorgan and Mastercard have great earnings momentum that will help their shares propel higher when rate sensitive stocks come under pressure ",2018-10-08,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-financial-stocks-to-power-your-portfolio-when-interest-rates-climb-200347293,200347293

The company has performed extremely well for past several years with potential to carry on the momentum in the near future as well 
Year to date  the stock has surged 33  compared with the  s rally of 18 8  

 
Why an Attractive Pick 
Solid Rank   Growth Score  Mastercard sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a favorable Growth Score of B  Our research shows that stocks with an impressive Growth Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 offer solid growth opportunities  Thus  the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment

Strong Earnings Growth Prospects  The company s Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 31 for 2018 earnings reflects a year over year surge of 37 8   Moreover  the metric is projected to register 15 4  increase in 2019 
Growth Drivers  A series of acquisitions made by the company in recent years should complement its organic growth 
The company s revenues witnessed an impressive CAGR of 11  during the 2012 2017 period  The same was up 31  in the first quarter  We believe that the company should retain its revenue momentum in the coming quarters  riding high on its strong market position and a profitable core business  which continues to be driven by new deals  renewed agreements and an expansion of service offerings 
International markets  Asia Pacific  Canada  Europe  Latin America  Africa and the Middle East  provide both growth and diversification benefits to Mastercard  These markets have potential to generate growth over the coming years  led by a shift toward card usage and higher consumer spending  Moreover  these markets remain less penetrated than U S  markets 
The company s strong international business has led to an increase in cross border volume growth for the past several quarters  21  in the first quarter of 2018  13  in 2017  12  in 2016  and we expect this trend to continue in the going ahead  
The company s consistent investment in technology also positions it well in a rapidly shifting payments space  It includes investment in Artificial intelligence  blockchain  tokenization  biometrics and much more 
Strong Balance Sheet  Mastercard boasts a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility and a continuous cashflow from operating activities  Its disciplined capital management strategy by way of share buyback and dividend payments remains impressive  We believe the company will continue to generate favorable cash from operations owing to its expandingbusiness volumes  Its robust capital position enables it to pursue acquisitions  which have already ramped up its inorganic growth profile 
Strong and Growing ROE  Mastercard s trailing 12 month return on equity  ROE  of 92  remains significantly higher than the industry s 39  average  This  is turn  reinforces its growth potential  The figure also reflects the company s tactical efficiency in using shareholders  funds  Moreover  the company s ROE has grown steadily over a period of five years

Mastercard  MA  was steadily moving higher until it made a top in March  It pulled back then to the 50 day SMA and held  It continued to move sideways then for a month  a period that ran up to its earnings report  After the report the stock gapped higher  over the March high  and it has consolidated there for most of 3 days  Friday afternoon it started to move to the upside and closed at a new all time high

The May options chain shows open interest biggest on the call side  with the 185 and 190 strikes the biggest  Put open interest is focused at the 185 strike  In June the open interest is biggest at the 180 call and spread to 195  The July chain sees open interest on the call side spread from 170 to over 210  but focused at the 150 put strike  You have to look to October to cover the next earnings report and the open interest there is biggest at the 195 call

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which as May begins sees the equity market continuing to move sideways in consolidation without any energy  but a slightly improving picture 
Elsewhere look for Gold to hold or bounce off of support in its range while Crude Oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index continues to show strength in the short term moving higher while US Treasuries are consolidating at a lower high  a possible Dead Cat Bounce  The Shanghai Composite is consolidating in a downtrend clinging to support while Emerging Markets continue to retrench in the uptrend 
Volatility looks set to remain low and more stable taking pressure off of the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts all ended the week stronger on the shorter timeframe and in consolidation near the top on the longer timeframe  In the short term the QQQ and IWM look a bit stronger than the SPY  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

190272,411788,MA,All Eyes On Oil,opinion,"Following closely on the heels of his friend and colleague Warren Buffett  Bill Gates has added  to the fire by saying   

This of course sparked an uproar from crypto advocates on social media  Not that anybody is particularly concerned with sentiment coming from those in their ivory towers  it s more the shock at the apparent lack of understanding by those same individuals

The US markets were performing fairly well yesterday until about an hour before the closing bell when US President Donald Trump sent this tweet   

Most were already expecting this to happen  so it s not clear why the markets took the news so poorly  In this graph  you can see the exact minute of the tweet circled in purple 

The wide expectation is that the USA will pull out of Barack Obama s Iran deal today  All eyes will be watching  at the time of the announcement 
Oil has been rallying strongly since the beginning of the year and most recently has been toying with the level of  70 a barrel  largely on the expectation that Trump will pull out of the deal  So  on the off chance that he does decide to try and salvage the deal  we could see oil plummeting quite quickly 

However  as the announcement was indeed expected for some time  it s entirely possible that the news is already priced into the market  If this is the case  we may end up seeing the old adage of  buy the rumor  sell the news  play out once the market excitement dies down  MasterCard is Missing Bitcoin
Ok  I know this is old news but still worth noting  On a call last week  Mastercard  NYSE MA  s CEO stated that cross border volumes were 2  lower than they were in the previous quarter due to fewer transactions buying Bitcoin 
We all know that Q4 of 2017 was a very popular time to buy cryptocurrencies and it seems that the decrease of crypto transactions in Q1 of 2018 notably dented the credit card giant s profits 
The company is doing fine  of course  Their profits did rise pretty sharply anyway and their stock is now sitting at an all time high 

However  the drop in MC s Bitcoin profits is not necessarily the result of weaker sentiment  It should be mentioned that several large banks have banned their customers from buying Bitcoin with credit cards as of early February 

It seems these banks have cut off their nose to spite their face  People who have a desire or a need to use cryptocurrencies will certainly do so  By not facilitating their transactions you are not only doing a disservice to your customers  you are also missing out on those transactions 
Let s have an awesome day ahead

today Royal Dutch Shell s shares have gained 23 5  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry  which has gained 8 3  over the same period  Such performance was primarily supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters The company finished 2017 on a solid note with the integrated behemoth s fourth quarter upstream unit profit soaring from the year ago period thanks to steady commodity price recovery  Importantly  the Anglo Dutch company generated healthy cash flows yet again  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend  However  with production volumes going down  Shell s near to medium term revenue outlook remains cloudy Shares of Mastercard have increased 61 8  over the last one year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry s gain of 36 6  during the same period  The company is well positioned for growth  given its solid

the company s efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 10  upward over the last 60 days However  the company continues to face increasing costs  Moreover  higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on the bottom line Itau Unibanco Banco s shares have

However  rising operational risk  with management s expectation of non interest expenses to grow in the range of 0 5 3 5  in 2018  remains a concern Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today

190320,411836,MA,Mastercard  MA  Gears Up For Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Mastercard Inc    NYSE MA   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 1  before the opening bell 
We expect an increase in net revenues primarily driven by increases across its revenue categories  accretive impact of acquisitions  higher switched transactions and increase in gross dollar volumes  The revenue growth  however  will be offset to a large extent by higher operating and personnel expenses reflecting continued investment in strategic initiatives 
Factors Likely to Impact Fourth Quarter Earnings 
Increase in Rebates and Incentives  Rebates and incentives  recorded as contra revenues  increase in the first nine months of  2017 and the same trend is expected to be seen in the fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements  and increased volumes 
Expanding Service Business  The company s efforts in expanding its services business  which has been posting strong earnings  are its differentiators in the market  Higher utilization of the company s service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter  and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported 
Higher Gross Dollar Volume  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gross Dollar volume which measures all Mastercard Credit Charge and Debit programs  and includes purchase volume plus cash volume  one of the main revenue drivers  is expected to be  1 36 trillion  up almost 11  year over year 
Growth in Different Areas  Product Launch  Deals and Partnerships   Fourth quarter results would manifest the company s targeted growth from its card offerings in different verticals   consumer credit  debit and commercial prepaid  Its continued investments in physical digital convergence will keep it ahead in an industry witnessing rapid technology usage and accrue to its top line  Also  several new deals  extension of partnerships and agreements  new product launches  upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard s top line 
Other Factors
MasterCard s top line in the fourth quarter would gain traction from its massive international business 
The company s disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line Earnings will  however  be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives  primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements  Also  accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company s bottom line 
We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax rate international markets  accounting for more than 60  of the company s revenues  than in the prior year 
MasterCard s use of capital in buying back shares will provide an extra cushion to its bottom line 
Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 5 84   This is depicted in the chart below

190321,411837,MA,Bitcoin  The Trend Toward Decentralization,opinion,"It s been called a number of things  The sharing economy  or  shareconomy   Peer to peer economy  Collaborative consumption  What all of these terms have in common is the idea of decentralization and blockchain applications  including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  are just the latest in a trend toward this new economic paradigm 
If it s unclear what decentralization means  consider the following visual  You might have seen one like it before  On the left is a representation of a centralized  top down system  Think of a traditional corporation  one that has only one CEO and one head office 

Now compare that to the next two visuals depicting decentralized and distributed systems  Instead of being top down  their infrastructures are more collaborative  helping to prevent systemic failure  collusion and more 
This is the  sharing economy  business model that s growing in prominence thanks to the internet and practiced by companies such as Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Airbnb  Uber and more  Although these firms have one CEO and headquarters like a more traditional company  their assets are decentralized and widely distributed  Facebook s content is collaborative among 2 billion users worldwide  Airbnb and Uber s hotels and cabs are privately owned  Jack Ma s Alibaba  NYSE BABA  has no inventory of its own  relying instead on a decentralized network of retailers and manufacturers 
Blockchain  and bitcoin specifically  is the logical conclusion to this trend  Bitcoin is completely open source and peer to peer  No one owns it  Unlike fiat currencies  it s not controlled or regulated by a central authority  This is possible only through the power of blockchain  the decentralized  unmodifiable electronic ledger that records all activity across the entire system 
We re in the very early stages of this new paradigm  but already much is expected  Mastercard  NYSE MA  believes the sharing economy will inevitably graduate beyond social media and accommodations  spreading  into new sectors  including insurance  utilities  health and social care   And UBS estimates that by 2027  blockchain could add between  300 and  400 billion of annual economic value to the global economy

190362,411878,MA,4 Trades To Charge Higher In Mastercard  Bonus Idea ,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  is one of those stocks you wish that you owned a year ago  it has plodded higher ever since breaking out of consolidation in September 2016  It has given you a couple of chances to get in along the way  There was a consolidation in the spring before a leap higher in April  Another consolidation in June before a second push up  And a third consolidation at the end of August that it broke higher after Labor Day 
Now it seems to be giving you a fourth chance  After making a new high in early September it pulled back to its 20 day SMA  This has acted as a support area since March  The 20 day SMA as support is a sign of strength  And Friday it pushed up off of that support  It is approaching the prior high  and a break over it would be the buy signal  There is resistance at 143 above and support lower may come at 138 and 136 with a gap then to 134 40 and 132 50 
Momentum is supportive for more upside price action  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone  In fact the lower low in the RSI last week combined with a higher low in prices sets up a Positive RSI Reversal  and gives a target to 149  The MACD has leveled after resetting lower but positive  Short interest is low in the stock at just 1  and it trades ex dividend starting October 5th  The company is expected to report earnings next on October 31st 
The options chain for this week shows a large open interest at the 135 put strike and a smattering of open interest on the call side  biggest at 144  if anything a bias lower  but 135 is a long way off  October monthly options are also biggest at the 135 strike and then big again at 140 on the call side  November 3 options  the first past the reporting date  are just building open interest  The November monthly options which were the only ones that could cover the report up until 2 weeks ago show large open interest at the 135 and 130 put strikes that matches the size at the 145 call strike  This smells of a large protective collar trade 
Mastercard  Ticker   MA
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 143 with a stop at 138 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 143 with a November 3 expiry 141 135 Put Spread   2 10  and then sell the November 10 Expiry 147 Calls   1 08  to pay for half of the protection 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the November 3 expiry 134 142 145 Call Spread Risk Reversal  7 cents  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the October November 3 expiry 145 Call Calendar   1 15  and sell the October 27 expiry 138 Put   1 10  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as the book closes on the 3rd Quarter sees stocks are driving to new all time highs and looking very strong 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its short term pullback while Crude Oil continues to trend higher  The US Dollar Index is consolidating after a long fall and maybe ready to reverse while US Treasuries are biased to continue lower in the short term  The Shanghai Composite continues to consolidate and Emerging Markets are consolidating in their uptrend 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts all look fabulous in the longer timeframe  The IWM may need a breather after a strong run while the SPY and QQQ also look strong in the short run  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

The May options chain has large open interest above at 119 and 120 on the call side  But it also has big open interest at 115 and then 110 on the put side  The June chain is tight on both sides between 115 and 120  On the July chain open interest is big from 110 to 120 on the call side with smaller amounts lower on the put side  And the September options  the first after the next earnings report  show biggest open interest at the 125 call

190390,411906,MA,How To Trade Mastercard Incorporated This Week,opinion,"Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  has Underperformed its Peers but Fundamentals are Strong
2017 is shaping up to be the year of rising interest rates and increasing profits for banks and credit card companies  But the recent performance of Mastercard Inc has underwhelmed to a degree  The stock has performed in a rather lacklustre way against its competitors in Visa Incorporated  Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ   Fidelity National Information Systems  et al 
Currently  Mastercard s dividend payout is 21 41  and its dividend yield is 0 74   Compared to Mastercard s peers  the average dividend payout is 42 04  and the dividend yield is 1 05   For MA stock holders  these numbers are none too flattering  However  analysts agree that if MAs dividend score is maintained  there could be some dividends in the pipeline moving forward  Compared to its peers  Mastercard s dividend quality score is noticeably higher  It is currently at 92 while the peer average is at 54  data provided by CapitalCube  
Mastercard Peers   Comparative AnalysisThere are many positives to look at when considering Mastercard stock  For starters  the U S  division of the company is performing well relative to its peers  While earnings growth is a little disappointing  the area where MA shines is rates of return  ROR   The company s robust profitability will certainly propel the stock moving forward  Mastercard s capital investment is minimal  This suggests that the company is deriving tremendous profits from its core business operations 
With additional interest rate hikes in 2017  we are likely to see ongoing profitability for Mastercard  Consider that the year on year revenue growth of MA is 11 47  TTM   while that of its industry peers averages out to 14 9  Where MA shines over its competitors is with earnings growth  MA has a 6 59 TTM earnings growth  year on year percentage   while its peers are currently falling at  10 82  These numbers simply point to optimism for MA stock and that bodes well for long term call options for binary options traders 
What s Going on Behind the Scenes  Long or Short for Traders As a trader  there are some encouraging signs for MA stock  For starters  the current price is comfortably holding above the 50 day MA of  110 60 and the 200 day MA of  102 92  The trend since February 2017 remains bullish  We are currently seeing short term reversals but these are unlikely to hold up for any significant period of time  Then  there are other clear signs as to the future direction of MA stock  In 2017  three major upgrades of Mastercard stock took place  These included the following 

RBC Capital Markets upgraded MA to Top Pick stock in January 2017
Wedbush upgraded MA to an Outperform stock in January 2017
Loop Capital upgraded MA to a Buy rating in February 2017


The Final Word  Security Acquisitions are Growth Drivers for MastercardReturning to our Dividend Yield vs Dividend Quality Score we see that MA slots into the low yield  high score category  Ideally  MA would like to be   in the high yield  high score quadrant but that belongs to companies like Western Union  Verizon Communications  and Fidelity Information Services  From another perspective  several new acquisitions by MA have proven beneficial to the company s security offerings 
Mastercard  like Visa  AMEX and Discover  has been battling enhanced security protocols vs customer convenience  In March 2017  MA acquired NuData Security  This company is engaged in fraud prevention via passive biometrics technology  After Q4 earnings for 2016 were reported in January 2017  MA s growth in  Other Revenues  was measured 21  higher  year on year   And fueling that strong growth is enhanced security and fraud detection  That s what makes biometric security company acquisitions like NuData so significant ",2017-04-18,anyoption,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-trade-mastercard-incorporated-this-week-200183259,200183259

190453,411969,MA,Banking Round Up  Wells Fargo Fined  185 Million  Mastercard Sued For  19 Billion,opinion,"Illegal banking practices finally caught up to Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    The bank was fined  185 million  including a  100 million penalty from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau   35 million to the office of the Comptroller of the Currency  and  50 million to the City and Country of Los Angeles 
Dating back to 2011  the illegal practices include Wells Fargo employees secretly issuing credit cards without any consent from the customer  as well as creating false email accounts in order to sign up customers for online banking services  These customers only learned about the fake accounts after they began accumulating high fees  according to  
Regulators allege that Wells Fargo opened a total of roughly 1 5 million deposit accounts and applied for 565 000 credit cards  Debit cards were also requested and issued without any knowledge or consent from customers  with some employees even creating PINs 
 Wells Fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses   Richard Cordray  director of the CFPB  said in a statement   Because of the severity of these violations  Wells Fargo is paying the largest penalty the CFPB has ever imposed  
 Today s action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs  if not monitored carefully  carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences   Mr  Cordray continued 
As a result  Wells Fargo has agreed to pay  2 6 million to refund fees that were charged  The bank also fired around 5 300 employees in connection to these illegal practices 
Mastercard Sued for  19 Billion
Across the pond  credit card issuer Mastercard Inc    NYSE MA   is  for  14 billion  or  19 billion  in damages for allegedly charging customers excessive fees 
The case was brought by a former chief financial services regulator  who claims that Mastercard charged  unlawfully  high fees to retailers when shoppers used wither their debit or credit cards  The payments company allegedly did this for 16 years between 1992 and 2008 
Mastercard  though  isn t going down without a fight  and the company has denied any wrongdoing   Now that the claim has been filed  we will take time to review it in detail  However  we continue to firmly disagree with the basis of this claim and we intend to oppose it vigorously   Mastercard said 
About 46 million people in Britain may potentially benefit from the lawsuit  any person who lived in Britain  who used a credit card  cash or checks  and who was over 16 years old during the time period of the suit will automatically be a part of the claim  And even consumers who are no longer living in Britain  but who were residents during the 16 year time period  can opt in to the lawsuit 
Hearings for the case are not expected to begin until 2018 unless Mastercard settles the lawsuit out of court

Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Global Payments Inc    NYSE GPN   has an Earnings ESP of  1 47  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to report second quarter earnings results on Jul 28 MasterCard Inc    NYSE MA   has an earnings ESP of  1 11  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to report second quarter earnings results on Jul 28 LPL Financial Holdings Inc    NASDAQ LPLA   has an Earnings ESP of  2 33  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to report second quarter earnings results on Jul 28 ",2016-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-total-system-(tss)-pull-off-a-surprise-in-q2-earnings-200143853,200143853
190461,411977,MA,3 Ways To Trade MasterCard Into Earnings,opinion,"Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA  has been in a tightening range since making a top in November  After making a series of lower highs and then higher lows  the price action has formed a symmetrical triangle  It is a little more than 50  of the way into the apex  approaching the power zone 2 3 of the way though  A break of this triangle would look for a move of about  21 
Into Thursday s earnings  the stock price is in the middle of the range after a 4th touch  at the lower rail  It is also right at its 200 day SMA  which has been running flat for 7 months  With the 50 day SMA crossing down    a death cross    there s one indication of a possible pullback soon 
The RSI is stalling and moving sideways before a move into the bullish zone and the MACD is rising having just moved into positive territory  A mixed picture from momentum  The Bollinger Bands  have turned and opened higher  A Measured Move to the upside out of consolidation would target a run to 100  breaking the triangle along the way  I d give the chart a marginal bias to the upside 
The weekly options show traders pricing in a  3 10 move  3 3   by Friday  This compares to the average of the moves following the last 6 earnings reports of about 2 0   Open interest is biggest on the Put side at the 92 and 94 5 strikes  On the Call Side it is biggest at 91 and then spread from 92 5 to 95  Short interest is less than 1  in this name  Options this week show no bias 

Trade Idea 1  For the long holder  protection can be had by buying a weekly 92 Put for about  1 05  This gives protection as far down as the stock might go  If comfortable that the options traders have the move measured correctly at  3 00 then you can also sell the weekly 90 Put for about 50 cents to cut your cost in half  The selling an August 97 5 Covered Call for 50 cents brings your down even further  Full Collar  Long July 29 Expiry 92 90 Put Spread and selling August 97 5 Call for free 
Trade Idea 2  For the speculator there are two choices  The first is to sell the range with a July 87 5 97 5 Strangle  But this only pays 1 2   Moving this out to August expiry pays  1 00 or a little over 1  for a 3 week period  The second choice is a trade biased to the upside  Buying the July 93 5 96 Call Spread costs about 95 cents  Selling the July 90 Put cuts that cost by over 50  but adds the risk of owning the stock at 90  Call Spread Risk Reversal  Buy the July 29 Expiry 93 5 96 Call Spread and sell the July 29 Expiry 90 Put for 47 cents 
Trade Idea 3  If you wish to own this stock  but from a lower level  then a 1 2 Put Spread fits your view  The July 92 5 90 1 2 Put Spread  buying the 92 5 Put and selling 2 of the 90 Puts  costs about 25 cents  That is your maximum risk if the stock moves higher  If it moves lower then you participate in the downside from 92 25 to maximum profit at 90  Below 90 you will be put the stock with a basis of 87 75  July 29 Expiry 92 5 90 1 2 Put Spread for 25 cents ",2016-07-27,Gregory W.

190481,411997,MA,Today s Trading Plan  The Faltering Bounce,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
Yesterday marked an extremely boring an inconsequential day of trading
In the final hour of trading  S P 500 gave up all of its gains on the day and finished nearly flat 
The big concern for me on the chart is that there is now a very obvious  that is forming on S P 500 daily over the past two months  Confirming the move would take price down into the 1900 s fairly quickly 
I believe at this point  profits have to be taken aggressively  and avoid the tendency to let the profits run 
50 day moving average is holding strong  but the doji candle formed on SPX yesterday wasn t entirely convincing of a follow through like candle 
SPY  NYSE SPY  volume was less than what was seen on Friday and below recent averages 
SPX 30 minute chart did manage to put in a higher high and stop the series of lower highs 
VIX sold off 1  yesterday after being up nicely early on  At this point  it appears more inclined to test the low  13 s than it does to test 16 40 again 
The number one objective for the  coming into today is to break price back below last weeks lows of 2039  Do that and you have the  
Bulls need to get price back over the highs from yesterday and then reclaim the 20 day moving average again 
Historically the May through October time frame is much weaker than the rest of the year

190482,411998,MA,Today s Trading Plan  Which Way Do We Go,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
S P 500 followed through on Thursdays afternoon rally with a respectable rally on Friday  
The rally started off strong  but throughout the day  put in a series of lower highs on the 5 minute chart and never built on the early morning gains 
SPX still trading below the 50 day moving average  and not trading above the middle band  20 day moving average  
Volume dropped for a second straight day  but still managed to provide above average volume 
The key for the  is  and continues to be  to drop the market below 2039 40 level and close below
This level represents the neckline of the well defined and confirmation level of a  
SPX is trading inside of a well defined channel on the daily off of the April highs  Currently the declining resistance is at 2067 
SPX 30 minute chart has still not put in place a higher high  despite putting in place a 33 point rally off of Thursday s lows 
VIX continues to see sharp breakdowns at the 16 40 level and continues to vacillate on a closing print basis between 13 and 16 40 
The pullback on the weekly chart of SPX has been very shallow  and could ultimately be a bull flag pattern that it putting in place 
The massive head and shoulders pattern is still in play for SPX and even confirmed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
The moving averages are all converging on current price action which is a sign of a market that hasn t moved any where in a couple of months 
The last two times we saw this happen  a massive sell off ensued  last August and December January  
If SPX manages to dip below 2040  the ability for the market to move in much bigger chunks in either direction becomes very possible 
From 2040 to 2138   you have a price range that is insanely choppy and continues to be such 
The 50 week and 100 week moving average have crossed two weeks ago to the downside  Last time this happened was 2001 before the tech correction and again in June 2008 before the mortgage crisis saw its major correction 
I believe at this point  profits have to be taken aggressively  and avoid the tendency to let the profits run   the market is in a very choppy range that has mired stock price for the past two years  Unless it breaks out of it and onto new all time highs  then taking profits aggressively is absolutely important 
Historically the May through October time frame is much weaker than the rest of the year

190490,412006,MA,Can Mastercard Inc Successfully Navigate The Potholes Ahead ,opinion,"On January 29  2016  Mastercard Inc  NYSE N MA  will tell investors how it faired in the December quarter  In its last report  3Q2015  the company posted mixed results in which adjusted EPS of  0 91 both rose from the previous year s same quarter and beat the consensus estimate  But revenue of  2 53 billion missed the consensus estimate of  2 55 billion despite rising 1 6  from a year ago 

Mastercard s 3Q profitability was largely supported by strong card spending  especially in the U S  and Asia markets  It will be interesting to see what the company reports for 4Q  However  investors want to know what opportunities or challenges lie ahead for Mastercard in 2016 and how the company is prepared to deal with them 
The rise of mobile and online payment systems have been cited as potential headwinds for Mastercard and Visa Inc   NYSE N V  because they threaten to temper with their revenues in paperless payments market  Beyond digital disruption  there are legal and regulatory issues that could make or break Mastercard  Nevertheless  amid all the challenges  Mastercard is showing a great degree of resilience  What can you expect from Mastercard in 2016 
Near term long term strengths
Disrupting the disruptor
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  is fully aware that people are finding alternatives to its card payments service online and on mobile  The shift to mobile online payments is also fueled by the penetration of e commerce  Not to be left behind  Mastercard has and continues to ink strategic deals to ensure that it both defends its core cards business and takes advantage of the disruptive technologies 
For example  the company recently announced that it was getting together with Coin to bring payment capability in wearables such as smartwatches  fitness trackers and even jewelry  It is estimated that wearable payments market could be worth  53 billion by 2019 
Wearables are only a part of Mastercard s non traditional payments offerings  The company has a program it calls  Commerce for Every Device   Under the program  Mastercard is working to support payments in virtually any connected device  Perhaps as part of that program  the company also recently launched an app that allows owners of modern Samsung  KS 005930  refrigerators to order and pay for groceries from the touchscreen of the fridge 
From the above developments and what the management has promised  Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  can be seen taking advantage of the technology initially appeared to threaten its existence 
Legacy payments business remains healthy
As much as digital payments services are helping people to sidestep traditional payment cards  the presently low global payments card penetration is a tailwind for Mastercard s core business  Payment card systems are also poised to benefit from the secular shift from check and cash payments as more people move to take advantage of the security and convenience of carrying a card 
In the U S   card based transactions are expected to grow at 10  CAGR to reach an estimated  6 0 trillion by 2017  up from  4 1 trillion in 2013 

The market potential for Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  and its peers is also huge abroad  especially in regions like Asia Pacific and Africa where millions of people still don t have bank accounts  If it does its calculations well  Mastercard should grow at a double digit rate in the international market compared to anticipated single digit growth domestically 
Mastercard generates 40  of its revenues from the U S  and the rest from international markets 
Cross border transactions
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  benefits immensely from a healthy international travel market  Transactions by cardholders when they travel abroad generate higher profit margins for Mastercard because of cross border transactions chargers  About 20 to 30  of Mastercard s total gross revenue comes through international travel 
A business tough to copy
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  may face pressure in new market vectors such as digital  but its core cards business has high barriers to entry for newcomers  Not only has the company built a strong business network spanning more than 38 million merchants with over 1 billion branded cards in circulation  Mastercard is also a highly recognized global brand  With the growing cybersecurity threats  merchants and consumers are more comfortable working with reputable brands in their payments  which bodes well for Mastercard even as it expands into digital platforms 
Pressure zones
As much as Mastercard has multiple opportunities to exploit for continued growth  there are exist challenges for the company to navigate on its way to prosperity  But some of these challenges actually threaten the company s existence 
Rival payments systems
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  is facing growing competition from mobile and online payment providers such as PayPal Holdings Inc  O PYPL   These competitors are giving Mastercard a rough run for paperless payment system dollars  E commerce is among the factors fueling the adoption of alternatives to card payments 
Slowdown in international travel
Mastercard draws a significant portion of its revenues and profits from backing cards payments for transactions taking place outside the country in which a card was issued  In a healthy international travel industry  Mastercard not only benefit from higher revenues but also gets to tap premium profit margins  As such  slowdown in international travel can greatly temper with the growth of the company s topline and bottom line metrics 
Controversy over Interchange fees
Interchange fees  which describes the fee paid between banks for card support  has been a controversial issue  Regulators in different parts of the world have in the recent years increased their scrutiny of interchange rates  If pressure builds on Mastercard that it is no longer able to set interchange rates  it can result in banks losing interest in issuing new cards  If banks become less willing to issue new cards  it can hurt Mastercard s growth  perhaps also slowing card penetration in the underserved markets 
Litigation pressures
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  as well as its rival Visa have quite a number of unresolved lawsuits in different geographies  In the U S  for instance  fantasy sports players have brought up class action lawsuits against Mastercard and Visa  They claim that the card networks made them believe that fantasy sports was legal by accepting their payments to providers  The players are demanding that the card networks refund their money alongside other fees they were charged for the transactions 
The large number of pending lawsuits and the uncertainty of their outcomes pose serious risksfor Mastercard  because they can end up in costly settlements that can significantly hit the company s bottom line 
Shareholder orientation
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  remains committed to returning value to shareholders even as it goes through a transition period that requires constant investments to keep up with the challenges  The company recently announced a fresh  4 billion buyback program that will be effective when the existing  3 75 billion repurchase program expires  About  786 million was remaining from Mastercard s current buyback authorization  which means that the company now has about  4 8 billion to return to shareholders over the coming quarters 
Bottom line
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  has a healthy balance sheet that reflected  3 9 billion of cash at the end of the last quarter  With such a flexible balance sheet  Mastercard should be in a position to defend and expand its market share as well as to continue to diversify its revenue streams

190498,412014,MA,Forget About MasterCard ,opinion,"Eight months ago  on march 7  we published  MasterCard To Recall Memories Of 2008    saying the stock  could be expected to revisit the price area of  70   We thought so  because the Elliott Wave Principle  the only method we use for our analyses  was suggesting Mastercard  N MA  is ready for its wave  4  to the south on the weekly chart  It is given below 
Following the Wave Principle s logic  that price trends move in five wave sequences  called impulses  we assumed MasterCard s is simply not finished yet  Its waves  4  and  5  were still missing  That is why we anticipated a decline  followed by an even larger recovery  The next chart shows how MasterCard has been developing since that forecast 
Well  the stock kept climbing for a while  only to form an ending diagonal reversal pattern for wave 5 orange  of 5 black  of  3   Soon after it was over  the bears returned with a bang  MasterCard stock plunged from  99 14 to  74 53 in wave  4   And  just when almost everyone was panically selling  prices started rising in wave  5   just as expected 
The trouble now is that every five wave impulse is followed by a same degree three wave correction in the opposite direction  In other words  MasterCard seems to be in great danger  since its uptrend might come to an end any minute now  If this is the correct count  the bears could take the stock back to  70 or even lower  In our opinion  this is not the time to invest in MasterCard ",2015-11-06,EWM Interactive,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/investors,-forget-about-mastercard-270516",270516
190499,412015,MA,Earnings Watch  Payment Pioneer On Deck,opinion,"VeriFone Systems  N PAY   the leading payment service solution provider  will be reporting its Q4 2015 earnings report on Monday after the closing bell  The company has beaten Wall Street analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings for 9 straight quarters and looks to continue the trend this quarter  New innovations and initiatives have been a point of emphasis for growth and opportunity as the rise of mobile payments and e commerce has been causing a ruckus in the industry  The Estimize contributors have predicted an EPS of  0 49 and revenue of  517 6 million while Wall Street analysts are not too far off on earnings  forecasting EPS of  0 48 but revenue of  513 4 million 
Focus On Europe
The San Jose  CA  based firm recently acquired InterCard AG  an established payment as a service provider  PaaS  in Germany  This highlights a solid positioning and market growth opportunity as Europe is shifting toward more cash less payment options  VeriFone s already significant reach across Europe and the globe is growing  as retailers are constantly looking for the best services to expand and simplify the payment process 
Additionally  a partnership has been finalized with Danish mobile payment application Swipp  Swipp can be used amongst 30 000 merchants in Denmark who employ VeriFone terminals and products  The payment process with Swipp is rather simple  When a consumer is ready to purchase an item  they will need to place their phone close to the terminal and swipe the application to complete a payment  VeriFone currently supplies more than 50  of all payment terminals in Denmark and expects this partnership with Swipp to help gain extra market share in Europe 
VeriFone Edge
Things at the world s leading payment and commerce solution provider are changing  As consumers prefer to shop online and as retailers and shops are starting to use other mobile technology systems for payments  like Square  N SQ   VeriFone has shifted its focus to enhancing the consumer experience with innovative solutions 
Enter VeriFone Edge  This new product is a Linux based terminal that provides merchants a wide array of payment solutions and services  For example  some of these new Point of Sale  POS  enhancements include immediate coupons  on the spot offers  and rewards for loyalty shoppers  a simple interface to make the payment process more smooth  and third party applications on the VeriFone App Marketplace to promote customization for merchants  The product has been made available and will be accessible in Europe in 2016  Sales and revenues directly from Edge will be a figure to watch in the coming quarters 
EMV Growth
Europay  Mastercard  N MA   Visa  N V   EMV  systems are those that accept credit cards with chips  You may have noticed your credit card provider has recently moved away from issuing cards with magnetic strips in favor of chips  Close to 40  of US card holders already have these chip enabled cards  The technology behind EMV is a technical standard that has already been widely accepted by most European countries and Canada  The payment terminals usually accept cards with chips rather than magnetic stripes and require a 4 or 6 digit PIN rather than a signature  In 2014  the percentage of EMV enabled devices only reached 27  

PAY data by YCharts
This immense growth is quite lucrative for payment terminal providers such as VeriFone  These numbers confirm a large revenue opportunity for VeriFone  it also points to the fact that there is plenty of room for future growth  Not only so  but merchants using non EMV compliant terminals just began assuming liability for fraudulent transactions starting on October 1  2015  a liability previously covered by the credit card companies  VeriFone CEO  Paul Galant  pointed out that none of the 1 million gas stations in the US have EMV capable devices and that this trend should change soon  providing VeriFone with steady revenue momentum  However  gas stations have been granted an extra two years to become compliant with EMV rules  due to the high cost of updating self service gas pumps ",2015-12-10,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-payment-pioneer-on-deck-375459,375459
190514,412030,MA,MasterCard  Could 2008 Happen Again ,opinion,"MasterCard Incorporated  NYSE MA  has been a wonder to behold ever since its IPO in 2006  The only disappointing period the stock had was during the 2008 stock market crash  when prices fell to slightly above  11 
However  MasterCard managed to recover quickly and is currently soaring above the  90 mark  Is there anything investors should worry about  Could 2008 happen again  To answer that  we need to see how 9 years of public trading look like through the prism of the Elliott Wave Principle  The Wave Principle is a technical method of market forecasting  postulating that stock market trends move in five wave sequences  called impulses  This means  that each stock is at some phase of a larger impulse at any given moment 
Judging from the above shown chart  MasterCard is about to finish its wave  3  soon  So  if we follow the pattern  we should expect wave  4  to the downside  The 2008 stock market crash is labeled as wave  2   Wave  4  is supposed to be a correction of similar degree  In 2008  MasterCard lost more than  20  declining from  32 to roughly  11  As a guideline  fourth waves usually end in the territory of previous fourth waves 
Here  wave  4  could be expected to revisit the price area of  70  where wave 4 of  3  ended  In conclusion  just like it did in 2008  we believe MasterCard could lose some  20 again  before wave  5  resurrects it ",2015-03-08,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mastercard-to-recall-memories-of-2008-244216,244216
190515,412031,MA,From The Floor  Brent WTI Spread Narrows To  10 B,opinion,"Tightened beltsFrom the floor can t help noticing that the Brent WTI spread is once again back below the  10 barrel mark after stretching out to beyond  13 b in February  There is more downside pressure on Brent at the moment with both the supply disruptions in Libya and particularly Iraq easing   says Saxo Bank s head of commodities  Ole Hansen   That brings the  58 b area into view with WTI support at the  49 b mark  At 0755 GMT  Brent crude was at  59 59 b and WTI was at  49 61 b Brent faces further headwinds this Wednesday with the monthly options expiry   There is huge interest around the  50 b strike and while I certainly don t see a  10 b selloff  we have support at  58 b and then at  55 b so let s see how the market reacts around those strikes  Are we looking at a significant narrowing of the spread then  Brent s relative weakness might indicate so but Hansen does not necessarily see a major narrowing   We continue to see inventory in the US rise but the slowdown in the rig count is not having any impact and that is disappointing for the longs  Indeed  it is disappointment all around for the WTI longs  which seem to have collectively  thrown in the towel   he says   Bearish bets on WTI rose to a high as bullish bets were significantly scaled back in the last week  

Stand and deliverIf Brent and WTI continue to flounder  it s a different story altogether in the European equities market  but with all the hype currently enveloping the sector  it is time to live up to that expectation  says Saxo Bank s head of equities Peter Garnry  There are a lot of expectations for European equities so we have to see them deliver now   says Garnry  pointing to a two standard deviation in the STOXX 600    If we don t see that in the Q1s  then there will be huge disappointment  Garnry is convinced  nevertheless  that the fundamentals are right and expects  the value of stocks at the moment to be confirmed  partly because of the lower euro  Garnry also still favours that S P 500 Put call for May 2015 as he fears  the stronger dollar will begin to squeeze the earnings of the major global corporations   citing the likes of Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   McDonald s  NYSE MCD   Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA   and Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  to name a few  We could see some negativity in Q1 results for the S P 500 companies   he warns 

Dollar primedAfter that rather powerful message from the US economy via Friday s nonfarm payrolls print which witnessed a rise in jobs of 295 000 and a fall in the unemployment rate to 5 5   the dollar performed well against most of its counterparts but still left significant room for improvement  says Saxo Bank s head of forex  John J Hardy  It s now a question of whether the dollar can break through and sail to new highs across the board   this week  he says  USD JPY is particularly in focus after the pair broke through 120 50  but Hardy sees a potential barrier at the  121 85 level   USD JPY was at 120 82 at 0755 GMT The impact certainly reverberated through to FX Options as one month USD JPY at the money vols spiked to 9 5 after the break of 120 50   If we close below that level  the upside trend might be reversed but most people now have their eye up towards the 122 level  the December highs   says the FX Option Desk s Dan Larsen  Volatility is still very cheap if only because we often see very large moves with this pair and it can move very fast   he says  Elsewhere  EUR USD one month vols may also have seen a rise but not as much as anticipated  Larsen says Fed rate hikeThe continued apparent underpinning of US economic strength in Friday s print has undoubtedly forced the focus once again on the possibility of a US Federal Reserve rate hike being brought forward  It s definitely increased the pressure on the Fed to do something   says Hardy  while the Fixed Income Desk s Michael Boye sees a June September timeframe for a hike at least if market chatter is to believed  The Fed still has the option to wait if it wants to though   adds Boye Certainly  it will have noted the impact on 10 year US Treasuries which spiked by 13 basis points to 2 2  and Boye adds that German bunds also got a boost rising to 16 40 for a 38 bps yield after the lows of last week With ECB bond buying starting today  it could be an interesting time for bonds  he adds Gold slumpAnd  perhaps not surprisingly  gold too is hitting the buffers  largely on the back of that US strength  says Hansen  There are more hawkish expectations surrounding the Fed now and gold took out  1 190 oz to bring  1 168 oz area into view   he says  A break of that could see gold head towards  1 150 oz  he adds Finally  he has a bitter warning on sugar  Shorts are at their highest on record so keep an eye on this as there are mean reversion opportunities here and sugar has fallen quite a lot  ",2015-03-09,Saxo Bank,https://www.investing.com/analysis/from-the-floor:-brent-wti-spread-narrows-to-$10-b-244386,244386
190516,412032,MA,The New Tell,opinion,"As our readers and newsletter followers know  we have been using the IWM trend line as THE tell for months  The Russell 2000 NR has been the leader now and one step ahead of its brethren this year    once it broke we became more defensive 

We bought support on the 100 sma  posted real time on our StockTwits account  on the first test and we dipped long again this week when we saw  ARCA IWM  outperform the other indices  We bought  NYSE MA  and  NASDAQ SPLK  on Thursday for a swing and were lucky enough to enjoy the solid breakouts on Friday  took some off but still long  
Nice trend line break SPLK   want more on this post 70

Solid breakout on MA

Once the IWM trend line broke we lost our  tell     we couldn t buy against it anymore  But now there s a new tell that has cropped up on our screens and the one we are using to gauge sentiment in this crazy bull market  The weekly 20sma on the  NASDAQ QQQ  
When the QQQ went over weekly BB it caused a short term top and then bounced on the weekly 20 sma  short term bottom   That s our map now going forward 

It gives us a mental edge when we have a clear tell in the market    a map that helps clear psychological noise  If you swing trade like us then do yourself a favor and keep this weekly chart of the QQQ on your radar

190517,412033,MA,Top Trade Ideas For Week Of June 1  2015  ATML  CBI  MA,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Atmel  Ticker  NASDAQ ATML
Atmel  ATML  is back at resistance that has held it since September  This time it comes from a higher low  As it consolidates under resistance the RSI is bullish and strong while the MACD is just leveling  not pulling back  A break above 9 would trigger a Measured Move to 10 20 
Chicago Bridge   Iron  Ticker  NYSE CBI
Chicago Bridge   Iron  CBI  had a long move lower that found a bottom in February  Since then it has stair stepped higher  Two weeks ago it made a high  outside of the Bollinger Bands  and has been pulling back ever since  But the Hammer reversal candle Thursday was confirmed higher Friday  The RSI has already turned up but with the MACD still falling 
ImmunoGen  Ticker  NASDAQ IMGN
ImmunoGen  IMGN  started higher in December reaching a top in April near 10 50  After a pullback that found support in May it started back higher and is rising along trend support  What makes this interesting now is that the Bollinger Bands are opening higher  The RSI is over the mid line and the MACD is rising  both supporting further upside price action 
MasterCard  Ticker  NYSE MA
MasterCard  MA  fell out of a symmetrical triangle in September but it turned out to be a false breakdown as the price quickly found support and rose  It has made two steps higher  with the current one looking like a Cup and Handle pattern  As it pulls back in the Handle the RSI is falling but remains positive  while the MACD is falling 
Pandora Media  Ticker  NYSE P
Pandora Media  P  had been pulling back since making a top in March 2014  the first leg brought it to 22 and then it bounced before starting the second leg lower in June 2014  That leg achieved the Measured Move lower in February  Since then notice the rounding bottom that has been building  Now it is at resistance with the RSI in the bullish zone while the MACD is trying to cross up 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into June sees the equity markets as mixed  with the NASDAQ QQQ strong but the ARCA SPY and ARCA IWM showing some short term weakness 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue to hold between 1180 and 1200 while crude oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US Dollar Index looks to continue higher while US Treasuries also are looking stronger  possibly breaking their downtrend  The Shanghai Composite is in pullback mode in the uptrend but at a good support level  while Emerging Markets are falling and look weak 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts are a bit mixed  with all better on the weekly timeframe than the daily  and the QQQ s the strongest short term while the SPY and IWM may pullback  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

190527,412043,MA,Why I m Long Mastercard,opinion,"Mastercard  NYSE MA  shares have been trading inside a big triangle pattern for some time now and I ve been paying close attention to the behavior of this share  Yesterday I started buying below  77 as I was receiving bullish signs of increased probability of breaking the triangle pattern 

I m bullish MA as long as it trades above  74 and my 1st target is at  84 and my 2nd target is  94  Yesterday s close was above the triangle resistance and price also made a new short term higher high above previous resistance level of  77  which was the higher close price 

The Ichimoku cloud support is below current price  The Chikou span is bullish above the candle prices and the tenkan sen and kijun sen are making a bullish cross  Even if price pulls back to back test the break out level we should not see a push below  75 50  My stop however is at  74 and I will look for intraday setups to add to my long position

190528,412044,MA,It May Be Time To Dump MasterCard,opinion,"Credit card stocks had a rocky summer before breaking higher after earnings  But there are mounting signs that the move higher was overdone and a pullback is in order  Some have already fallen 
One that looks ripe to succumb to gravity is Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA  

Sign Of A Reversal
Mastercard moved higher out of a symmetrical triangle pattern  The pop rode higher over 85 where it printed a Tweezers Top    the first sign of a reversal  That confirmed lower the next day  The RSI also moved into overbought territory and is now pulling back  It is extended from the SMA s as well  There is some support in the 83 15 to 83 60 area but if it breaks that  a Tower Top is a real possibility with a retracement back to the 76 to 77 50 area

190529,412045,MA,Rising Bitcoin Popularity Worries MasterCard,opinion,"The Bitcoin  BTC eUSD  4 hour chart below shows that buying pressure overwhelmed the bears  with the price up  5 73 or 1 52   It is above the cloud  along with the lagging line  giving a strong indication that the price is currently experiencing an uptrend  The price action has risen above its first daily resistance level at  380 83  which has held as strong support  The next resistances will be found at  383 03 and  386 57 
The green span is additionally moving above the red span  Additionally  its relative strength index isindicating an upward trend  signalling that the price has the potential ascend before returning  The cloud that is projected ahead is relatively flat  indicating support at a constant level for the next few days  around the  375 mark 

Mastercard  NYSE MA  used a submission to the Australian Senate Enquiry to discourage digital currency adoption  They noted that Australian lawmakers should enforce regulation to address the anonymity of transactions that occur with digital currencies  They additionally added that Bitcoin can be used to launder money and engage in illicit activities  as opposed to their payment service  It seems that MasterCard feels threatened by Bitcoin and other digital currencies  which may end up forcing them to re think their business model  The committee on digital currencies in Australia is scheduled to release its findings in March  2015 
Citi reckons that the auctioned Bitcoins from the Silk Road dark net website will be sold at discount prices  The U S  Marshalls Service  USMS  is set to auction 50 000 Bitcoin this coming Thursday  The recent decline against the dollar is cited as one reason why bidders may post lower prices during the auction  The USMS has roughly 90 000 more Bitcoin to auction  which are likely to be sold below the market price  However  the  know your customer  requirements for USMS auctions may put off some investors  who could just buy them on the open market 
The daily chart below shows that yesterday the price failed to close above the cloud  However  the price looks set to close above the cloud today  indicating an upward trend  Unless the price closes below  the candle will be above the cloud  The cloud projected forward has turned to green  with the green span moving above the red span  which is a strong bullish signal 
However  the base line remains above the conversion line  and a close above the base line at  397 16 would give an indication of bullish momentum  A strong break above  400 would be expected to materialize if this occurs  Additionally  its relative strength index is slightly bullish  since it is more than 50  currently at 54 62  indicating that the price should move higher before retreating towards the cloud ",2014-12-03,Ben Myers,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rising-bitcoin-popularity-worries-mastercard-234540,234540
190543,412059,MA,Is Visa Inc  Telling Us The Consumer Is Tapped Out  ,opinion,"Consumer spending makes up over 70  of the US economy  Companies like Visa Inc   NYSE V  and Mastercard Inc   NYSE MA  rely heavily on the American consumer to spend  thereby generating transaction fees and also charging obscene interest rates if you carry a balance  It would seem from the charts that more and more people are now maxed out  and possibly falling behind on their minimum payments  While the stock market closes at new all time highs  Visa Inc  has been struggling to climb back to its highs made on January 21  2014  This tells us there could be trouble on the horizon for the US economy 
If the US consumer cuts back on spending you can see how this would negatively affect both Mastercard Inc  and Visa Inc   and cause a major slowdown in the economy  With the weekly chart on Visa Inc  setting up in a Bearish manner  we at the Elite Round Table at InTheMoneyStocks will be looking closely at a short entry in the coming days

190544,412060,MA,Successful Bitcoin Auction Supports Breakout,opinion,"The USMS auction brought great news for  Bitcoin  traders and investors who  for a long time  have been waiting for a good breakout  After spending a considerable period near 600 610 levels  the price finally broke free and shot up nearly 7  to 640 levels owing to a successful auction in which 45 registered bidders participated 
Technically  the price has clearly signalled a breakout and only long positions should be considered  Short term traders who have bought at lower levels may book partial profits at current levels and look to lock in the rest at around 670  Medium to long term investors would be well advised to hold their positions  Fresh long positions can be made upon declines while placing a stop loss at 600 for a price target of 670  Aggressive traders are advised to build short positions near 670 675 for a target of 630 with 680 set as a major stop loss  The chart clearly depicts 680 as a strong resistance and a close above it would be a strong bullish signal leading to a possible frantic short covering  spurring a buying interest  which could take the prices even higher 
Now that the auction is over  traders and investors must keep up with other latest developments related to digital currencies  The Australian Tax Office  ATO  has postponed its ruling on treating Bitcoin for this year s tax submission period and has promised a ruling since February  In another major development  financial services leader Mastercard  NYSE MA  has filed for a patent to include Bitcoin in its global shopping cart  The Deloitte University Press has reiteratedin a report that the media is focusing only on the negative aspects such as government crackdowns and exchange meltdowns and not highlighting the  potential long term significance as a disruptive new money technology  that this digital currency has to offer ",2014-07-01,Ben Myers,https://www.investing.com/analysis/successful-bitcoin-auction-supports-breakout-218008,218008

190553,412069,MA,Higher Earnings Expected From MasterCard As Consumers Increasingly Swipe,opinion,"MasterCard Inc   NYSE MA  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Thursday  May 1st  MasterCard is a global financial services company most well known for the debit and credit cards that bear its name  Last week peer and rival Visa reported much higher than expected earnings  but also missed its revenue target by  34 million  or over 1   This quarter the Street expects MasterCard to report an earnings gain of 10c per share compared to FQ1 of last year and a year over year revenue increase of 12   The frequency at which consumers are using credit cards is increasing and Visa and MasterCard stand to gain while many newcomers to the mobile and electronic payments industry are attempting to disrupt their business  Here s what investors expect from MasterCard this quarter 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the  platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for MasterCard to report 72c EPS and  2 138B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 39 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 72c EPS and  2 145B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting MasterCard to report in line with Wall Street s expectations on EPS and come in slightly ahead of revenue projections 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting MasterCard s EPS and revenue 4 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a very small differential between the two groups  expectations on MasterCard s earnings 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 69c to 76c EPS and from  2 123B to  2 200B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wide range of estimates on MasterCard s EPS and a moderate range of revenue predictions 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of EPS  estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

This quarter the Wall Street and Estimize EPS consensuses for MasterCard both remained flat throughout the period  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus also remained largely unchanged while the Estimize consensus fell from  2 165B to  2 145B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revenue revisions going into an earnings report are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 73c EPS and  2 142B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked  among over 4 350 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 54  of the time respectively throughout over 2000 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is expecting MasterCard to beat the consensus on EPS by a comfortable margin while reporting between the projections from Wall Street and Estimize on revenue 
This quarter the Estimize community is expecting MasterCard to report a gain of 10c per share in earnings and a year over year revenue increase of 12 5   The credit card companies are doing well right now and emerging payment technologies are starting to their set sights on the high transaction fees that Visa and MasterCard charge merchants  For the time being though  growth prospects for MasterCard look solid

190567,412083,MA,Missed Out On Visa And Mastercard  Keep An Eye On FleetCor,opinion,Quick SummaryFleetCor Technologies  FLT  is a company with a strong moat in an attractive industry and performing well for shareholders The company has more room for growth but some questions have to be asked as to whether this will make it a good investment What is FleetCor Technologies Having missed out on Visa  V  and MasterCard  MA   stumbling upon FleetCor is a pleasant surprise FleetCor Technologies is a company that provides fuel cards and payment products used by employees  They also have lodging cards  but since the overall concept is the same  I will focus most of the discussion on fuel cards The important thing to understand is that although I ve included Visa and MasterCard into the conversation  fuel cards and credit cards are different in many ways First  what is a fuel card A fuel card  as the name suggests  is mainly used for fuel Companies that require lots of travel in their line of work gain a lot of benefits with issuing fuel cards to their employees instead of standard credit cards Here are the pros and cons taken from   Pros Discount fuel prices  i e  wholesale prices Ability to choose from multiple providers like Shell  Esso  Keyfuels  Texaco etc  This enables better pricing due to competition Need for carrying cash  or giving cash to drivers  eliminatedPrevention of fraudIncreased securityFilling patterns can be customized by Smartchip technologyFleet efficiency   MPG reportingReduced administration via management toolsAbility with some card management tools to capture private business driver mileage splitCons Card stopping cancellation periods can sometimes be longerGreater liability for fraudulent transactions often placed on customerCredit periods typically shorterRetail cards typically offer pump prices  usually higher than wholesale  and occasionally additional surchargeAnnual or monthly card provision charge sometimes applied  usually bunkered The pros far outweigh the cons and should now provide a clear picture of the business model FleetCor s Business Model is a Competitive AdvantageFleetCor has been around since 2000 and has grown mainly from acquiring smaller fleet card companies around the world The company does business in over 18 countries and has such an extensive network of where its cards are accepted that it would literally take a decade to replicate anything in the same size and scale There is also switching cost involved in such a network  Once you have gas stations equipped with hardware and software to work for these type of fuel cards  it s very difficult to switch It s different to just accepting credit cards and perform transactions Based on the data that fuel cards track  the data provided to the system from every gas pump is much more than the average credit card transaction This is a Very Profitable BusinessVisa and MasterCard are very profitable businesses  They receive a percentage in fees for every swipe Since I sell stock valuation tools on my site  I have to accept credit cards  So I understand how powerful this industry is in terms of profitability The fee per swipe racks up and I understand why little mom and pop shops don t like to take Amex cards or why they make you spend at least  10 before you can use a credit card Actual numbers showing profitability can be seen below High Insider Ownership is a Good SignThe CEO holds a 5 5  stake in the company of a current  6B company which is more than  300m Two members of the board are also part of Summit Partners which owns 28  of the company These insiders have a strong interest in the company and with key investors on the board of directors  it s pretty clear intentions are aligned with shareholders There are Always RisksThe majority of FleetCor s revenue is dependent on fuel prices  Since they receive a percentage of the sale  if fuel price drops  then the fee also decreases I don t see this playing out though  As the government continues to bring in more regulation and stricter practices  the cost to refiners will go up which will get passed onto the customer at the pump Another big risk come from competition  If companies like Shell or BP really get aggressive and try to launch their own version of the fuel cards  and prevent their gas stations from accepting FleetCor s cards  it will be a huge blow But this is something that the company s management have always known about and although it s been tried before  it has not succeeded The balance sheet is full of goodwill and intangibles from all the acquisitions  It makes up 51 1  of total assets and the debt to equity ratio is at 71  Fundamental Numbers What better way to identify profitability than ROE and  which is an improved version of ROIC  Some numbers to bring it all together Strong returns for any business but let s take it a step further  I have been using the  a lot to really dig into whether the ROE is organic or artificial The five step DuPont analysis shows in better detail that the drivers behind the ROE increase comes from an increase in operating margins and an increase in debt If I were to decrease the equity multiplier from 2 98 down to 2010 levels of 2 3  the ROE goes down from 23 7  to 18 3  Brief Valuation With the company still growing and investing cash for growth  using the standard DCF valuation is not the best idea  A better way to value FleetCor would be based on its income statement  Here is an  assuming 20  revenue growth in the next year Based on this valuation  even by using the aggressive assumptions  FLT looks to be overpriced at this point Overall VerdictA picture is worth a thousand words SummaryFleetCor has performed amazingly for shareholders since its IPO in December 2010 but rather than just jumping on board  I am watching this from the sidelines The business is attractive but the price paid determines whether a stock is a good or bad investment At current prices  I have to make aggressive valuations and assumptions but still it falls short of the desired valuation range I will gladly put it up on my watchlist though ,2013-04-23,Jae
