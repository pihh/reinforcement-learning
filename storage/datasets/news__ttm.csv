102880,324395,TTM,British government s vaunted China export deals don t add up,news,By Tom Bergin SOLIHULL  England  Reuters    Each aluminum Land Rover body that rolls along the production line at Solihull carries a lengthy sheet of paper giving the vehicle s specifications  At the top of the  build card  is the name of the country for which the vehicle is destined  In recent years around one in five of the cards has had  China  printed on it   I often think  how rich are the people in China   They buy so many   said line worker George Baker  amid a cacophony of forklift horns  beeping machinery and trumpeting line stoppage alarms  Jaguar Land Rover  JLR   owned by India s Tata Motors  NS TAMO   increased sales to China from around 250 million pounds in its 2009 financial year to almost 8 billion pounds in 2014 2015  allowing it to more than double its UK workforce   Jaguar s success  and deals to export other British goods and services worth billions of pounds  are cited as examples of the opportunities for selling into China and of how the government can help  open the door for British companies   Exploiting those opportunities is especially urgent since Britain voted last year to leave the European Union  a fact well understood by Prime Minister Theresa May  who needs fast growing markets like China to make up the numbers that may be missing soon from its European trade  But the impressive deals touted by the government are not quite what they seem  a Reuters analysis of the figures shows   The value of announced deals to export British goods and services to China since 2010 adds up to 36 billion pounds  according to official government releases over the period  often issued around the time of ministerial visits to Beijing  However  a Reuters examination of company statements  corporate filings and interviews with executives shows the value of actual exports from those deals have totaled less than 6 billion pounds   The upshot  government figures are giving an overly rosy picture of the state of UK China trade  economists said   If you look at these headline deals and they have a big number on them  I think that s not really very informative   said Holger Breinlich  professor of international economics at the University of Nottingham   You have to look at the small print and what s being spent in the UK    The Reuters analysis highlights the challenges British companies face in China  with whom the UK has a ballooning deficit  and how even a post Brexit free trade deal may fail to accelerate exports  The government declined to comment on the conclusions reached for this story  A spokeswoman for the Department of International Trade said the announced trade and investment deals would  help retain or even grow jobs in the UK  and will have benefits for the Exchequer too    For a graphic on UK China trade trends please click on this link     CHINESE CHALLENGES There are a variety of reasons why the deals have turned out smaller than announced  For one thing  more than 3 billion pounds worth of deals were preliminary agreements that were never completed   In other cases the amounts cited were for the overall value of a project in which the UK entity had a small role  For example  in 2013  the government touted a 6 billion pound deal between Oxford University and China Construction Bank  CCB  to help fund research into regenerative medicine   Donal Bradley  head of life sciences at Oxford  said the figure referred to the amount of money CCB could contribute towards research work  almost all of which would be done in China  Oxford s role was largely to provide advice on the creation of new research facilities in China  So far  the Chinese partner has paid around 1 5 million pounds to Oxford for its work  he said  In some cases  deals involved British companies agreeing to provide products that are manufactured outside Britain   For example  Thomas Pink was cited as signing a 57 million deal with a Chinese franchisee  but the London based shirt maker produces almost all its garments in Asia and Morocco   Government announcements in 2014 and 2015 cited agreements by oil and gas group  BP   LON BP  Plc to export 18 5 billion pounds worth of liquefied natural gas  LNG  to China  But LNG is not produced in the UK  and BP typically supplies customers from facilities in Indonesia  Trinidad and Australia  Although companies fulfilling contracts from non UK operations still make profits which can flow back to Britain  the impact is much smaller  The muting of the announced deals also reflects the reality that Britain s strength is more in services than manufacturing  British companies have signed billions of dollars of deals to provide Chinese clients with training  product testing  architectural and other services in recent years  But the services are largely delivered by staff on the ground in China  reducing the benefit to the British economy  Northumberland based Annie Barr International provides training to doctors and nurses in China  Founder Barr said she had signed deals worth 57 million pounds in recent years including a contract to open 100 clinics across China   At the early stages it was necessary to send out staff from the UK and her courses used training materials developed by staff in the UK  But most of the activity was in China   We won t have too many exports from the UK   Barr said   Distance  culture  language and government procedures around issuing visas  for example  all make China a harder place for British companies to do business  especially when compared with neighboring Europe   WIDENING GAP The trade gap between Britain and China has widened sharply in the past decade  with a drop in UK exports in 2015 pushing the deficit to over 25 billion pounds  equivalent to more than 1 percent of Britain s GDP   Goods exports to China dropped 18 percent in the first 11 months of 2016  according to the UK tax authority  which does not provide reasons behind its data  The U S  deficit with China has prompted President Donald Trump to threaten protectionist actions  but Britain is taking the opposite tack  hoping for more open markets   Ministers have said they want a free trade deal with China but declined to identify their priority market segments saying they were still in consultation with businesses  Andy Goss  Global Sales Director at JLR  said his cars can face a Chinese tariff of 25 percent  But other exporters  including Rolls Royce  LON RR  which sells aero engines and technology group TestPlant  said their products and services faced low or no tariffs already thanks to World Trade Organization rules  Alan Winters  professor of economics at the University of Sussex  said non tariff barriers  such as government support for state backed enterprises or difficulties in securing permits  were bigger limitations on UK businesses competing for Chinese customers  Trade treaties had a poor track record at tackling such barriers  he said  China s restrictive banking and insurance regulations are a key hindrance to capitalizing on one of Britain s biggest competitive strengths  said Guy Dru Drury  chief representative in China for the CBI  Britain s biggest business trade body   He added there was little sign China would open up its financial services sector  and instead  new Chinese regulations around areas like data protection were actually making the environment tougher for overseas companies  A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London said  the Chinese government has made unremitted efforts to improve its investment climate  and that policies to increase domestic consumption would improve opportunities for exporters to the country  Even where the market outlook is strong for UK companies  that may not lead to increased exports  however  JLR s exports to China have dipped since the company opened a plant in China in late 2014  for example   The authorities in China want us to build cars in China  Like most governments around the world  they want employment in China and they want Chinese parts purchased for the cars   Goss said  adding the approach was no different to other countries   Because of localization  you are going to see a different pattern of revenues   Goss added  This almost certainly will impact overall UK export growth given the increase in JLRs exports generated 60 percent of the growth in UK goods exports to China since 2008

102980,324495,TTM,British companies absorb Brexit shock  get on with business for 2017,news,"By William Schomberg LONDON  Reuters    Richard Bunce says he felt sick when voters decided to take Britain out of the European Union in June  forcing him into a emergency review of his firm s expansion plans   But six months on  orders are strong and a new growth plan is in place  according to Bunce  managing director of Mec Com Ltd which sells devices to protect against power surges to clients such as  Siemens   DE SIEGn  and  Alstom   PA ALSO   Far from the  profound and immediate economic shock  predicted by Britain s finance ministry in the event of a vote for Brexit  the economy has  so far  barely slowed  Bunce expects tougher times  But like many other executives trying to push their Brexit worries to one side  he invested   nearly half a million pounds on a new laser cutting machine over the summer  Now he plans to spend another 750 000 pounds   932 000  on robotic metal working equipment at Mec Com s plant near Stafford  a town 135 miles  217 km  northwest of London  after landing a big contract with a British food processing firm    We believe that the opportunities we have got will  one way or another  find a way around Brexit   Bunce said  To be sure  what Brexit means is far from clear  Britain is due to begin its two year divorce process with the EU early next year  Agreeing its new relationship could take a lot longer  Bunce is taking precautions in case his firm ends up facing tariffs on its exports to the EU  He recently traveled to Romania to discuss the possibility of expanding his company s existing unit there in the event of a  hard  Brexit   If that happens then we would need to find a way to switch very quickly  but as things stand we are planning for more UK business   he said  INVESTMENTS PLANNED Many other companies seem to be taking a similar approach  including technology giants Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  which have announced plans to create jobs in Britain in recent weeks  According to official data  businesses increased investment in the three months after the referendum   Manufacturing body EEF says the sector is its most upbeat in a year and a half  helped by an export boosting fall in the pound since the vote  and investment and hiring plans are up  In construction  office building has slowed but some companies plan to ramp up home building next year  A survey by IHS Markit showed growth in the construction sector hit an eight month high in November   Economists are now raising their predictions for British economic growth next year  after many of them initially warned June s vote would quickly cause a recession  The Bank of England in November made its biggest ever growth upgrade  saying the economy would grow by 1 4 percent in 2017  up from a forecast of 0 8 percent it made three months earlier  Some investors think that even this looks too cautious  Percival Stanion  head of multi asset funds at investment firm Pictet  predicted growth of nearly 2 percent in 2017   The expectations of a collapse in the UK were massively over pessimistic   Stanion said  blaming the pro EU views of many economists for skewing their forecasts  He said supermarkets and other retailers would probably absorb much of the inflationary hit caused by the fall in the value of the pound  rather than pass it on to customers  LONG TERM UNCERTAINTY For now the BoE   which is helping the economy with its massive stimulus program   is waiting to see who is right  the pessimistic investors who have pushed down the value of the pound by 13 percent since June or the country s consumers who have carried on spending  Gertjan Vlieghe  one of the BoE s interest rate setters  said he believed Britain was set for a  slow motion  slowdown   But the drag could be softer if there is progress toward a good Brexit deal for Britain  which would push up the value of sterling and ease the inflation hit  he said last month   Sterling s rise over the past month could also soften the rise of inflation  Looking further ahead  the impact of Brexit is harder to quantify without no clarity on what it might mean for exports  investment and migration in coming decades   You can easily see what the negatives are but they are in the medium term rather than the immediate one or two year timeframe   Stanion said   For now  companies are trying to get on with day to day operations as best they can  The British unit of German car seat maker Brose announced a 10 million pound investment on Dec  13 in a new paint facility at its plant in the central city of Coventry which supplies clients such as Jaguar Land Rover  NS TAMO   Juergen Zahl  managing director of Brose UK  said there were question marks about whether carmakers in Britain might end up shifting production to other countries in the EU in the event of a Brexit deal that leaves the sector facing high trade tariffs  But Japanese carmaker Nissan s  T 7201  decision in October to build more cars in Britain was a positive sign  he said   
 For us at the moment  other than this long term uncertainty that we have  it s pretty much business as usual   Zahl said ",2016-12-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/british-companies-absorb-brexit-shock,-get-on-with-business-for-2017-448500",448500

103124,324639,TTM,May s Nissan deal opens floodgates as rivals seek Brexit reassurance,news,"By Kate Holton and Costas Pitas LONDON  Reuters    Prime Minister Theresa May s deal to keep Nissan  T 7201  investing in Britain opened the floodgates on Friday to demands from rival car companies chasing their own assurances from the government that they won t be hurt by Brexit   Britain s biggest car maker Jaguar Land Rover  NS TAMO  and its biggest engine maker Ford  N F  welcomed the news that the Japanese group would build two new models in the northeastern English city of Sunderland  Both said they too needed to avoid the risk of being hit with tariffs on trade with the European Union  While the exact nature of the deal remains unknown  its announcement raised the prospect that Britain might be adopting an interventionist approach to placate exporters as it prepares to leave the world s biggest trading bloc   a stark change for a country known for its hands off approach to business   In isolation this wouldn t be a big issue  but this could be the start of a slippery slope where the government gets much more drawn into individual deals and negotiations than historically they have   Andrew Sentance  a former Bank of England policymaker and adviser to PwC  said   Dismissive of the more interventionist approaches of countries such as France and Germany  Britain became a leading destination for foreign investment by coupling a flexible labor market and low taxes with little state involvement in business  But the shock vote in June to leave the EU has heralded the biggest change in the way corporate Britain is run for at least a generation   A source told Reuters on Thursday the British government promised extra support to Nissan in a written assurance that Brexit would not hit the competitiveness of the Sunderland plant  which exports 55 percent of its cars to Europe  The government refused to go into details but said there had been no  sweetheart deal   Last month Nissan s CEO Carlos Ghosn warned that he would need a guarantee of compensation to offset any tariffs  Following a meeting with May earlier this month  Ghosn expressed confidence that her government would ensure Britain remained a competitive place to do business  News of the deal prompted an immediate reaction from rivals  who also raised the question of recruiting foreign staff if the government curbs immigration  as it has promised   We are talking to government at every level and asking for a tariff free trading environment  access to talent and the same legislative framework we have now   Jaguar Land Rover said   We want a level playing field   While Nissan s Sunderland factory made nearly one in three of Britain s 1 6 million cars last year  Indian owned Jaguar Land Rover produces more vehicles overall at several sites  Other exporters were keeping a close eye on the Nissan developments  with the boss of Airbus UK saying the agreement showed the aerospace and defense sectors needed to work together   One leading London banker  who declined to be named  said May appeared to be  playing to the home crowd  by prioritizing the auto industry over financial services  WINNERS AND LOSERS  U S  automaker Ford  N F  said it needed to sell its British made engines into Europe without tariffs and that it was looking for similar reassurances from the government    I don t think the government will be picking winners and losers in our industry   Jim Farley  vice president for Europe  Middle East   Africa  told Reuters   I would be very surprised if the UK government treats different companies differently   Britain s big carmakers are nearly all foreign owned and ship more than half of their exports to the other 27 countries of the EU  making the industry s future one of the big question marks hanging over Britain s plan to quit the bloc  Late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lured Nissan to open the Sunderland plant in 1986  beginning a recovery in British car making that had nearly collapsed in the 1970s   Colin Lawther  a senior vice president at Nissan  said Brexit had posed a  big hurdle  for the car industry   The UK government has been very good at working with us over the last few months to remove the uncertainty as much as they possibly can   he told reporters  Like most parts of England s industrial north  Sunderland voted strongly in favor of Brexit on June 23  The deal led to speculation as to what the government had offered Nissan to persuade it to make the next generation of its Qashqai and X Trail SUVs at Britain s largest car plant   Vince Cable  a former business minister who helped persuade General Motors  NYSE GM  to keep its north of England plant open in 2012  said he believed the Nissan announcement was a sign that the government would push for a  soft Brexit  deal with the EU that avoided the imposition of tariffs altogether   One of the key factors in keeping General Motors here was the confidence they had that we would stay within the European single market and the customs union   he told Reuters   Countries such as Turkey are part of the EU customs union without being member states  enabling them to trade freely with the bloc  
 I think  the government  almost certainly made it clear that British negotiating objectives will be to remain within the customs union   Cable said   I can t see how anything other than a customs union arrangement would satisfy the car industry  ",2016-10-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/may's-nissan-deal-opens-floodgates-as-rivals-seek-brexit-reassurance-435750,435750

103253,324768,TTM,Brexit to slow Slovak economy  finance ministry says,news,"BRATISLAVA  Reuters    Growth in the Slovak economy will slow by 0 1 0 2 percentage points this year and by up to 0 3 percentage points in 2017 as a result of Britain s decision to exit the European Union  the Finance Ministry said on Friday 
An expanding car sector is a major driver for the central European country and Britain is Slovakia s seventh biggest trade partner  with cars making up almost half of its exports 
The ministry last forecast economic growth of 3 2 percent this year  accelerating to 3 7 percent in 2017 and 4 1 percent in 2018  It will present an updated outlook in September 
In the report on Friday  it said a British departure from the EU will slash between 0 1 and 0 9 percentage points off growth by 2019  depending on different scenarios 
An optimistic scenario expects the situation to calm down and current trade relations with Britain to continue 
A more realistic one sees the creation of trade barriers  prolonged uncertainty and worsened economic sentiment in the EU  Under this  Slovakia  a country with 5 4 million  would lose almost 4 000 jobs by 2019 
The ministry s most pessimistic scenario counts on a more serious disruption of mutual trade  a recession in Britain and a significant economic slowdown in the EU 
 The pound s depreciation against the euro will decrease the attractiveness and accessibility of our products for the British consumers   the ministry s Institute for Financial Policy said 
 Even stronger will be a secondary effect of a slowdown in our key trade partners   Germany  Poland  France and the Netherlands   it said 
Credit rating firm Standard   Poor s said on Wednesday the risk of lower economic growth in central and eastern Europe  CEE  had started to rise in the wake of Brexit

103255,324770,TTM,PM May resurrects industrial policy as Britain prepares for Brexit,news,"By William James LONDON  Reuters    Prime Minister Theresa May will on Tuesday outline her bid to reshape the British economy for a post Brexit world  reviving the once unfashionable concept of industrial policy 30 years after Margaret Thatcher killed it off  May will chair the first meeting of the  Cabinet Committee on Economy and Industrial Strategy  in her Downing Street Offices  bringing together the heads of 11 other ministries to set out her vision for a state boosted industrial renaissance   If we are to take advantages of the opportunities presented by Brexit  we need to have our whole economy firing   May said ahead of the meeting in a statement released by her office    We also need a plan to drive growth up and down the country   from rural areas to our great cities   After a referendum campaign that revealed dissatisfaction in many of Britain s struggling post industrial regions  May is pitching a plan to reunite the country by raising the prospects of those who she casts as  hard working people   The June 23 vote to leave the European Union has raised serious questions about the future of the world s fifth largest economy  with some surveys indicating a recession  a hit to consumer confidence and a possible fall in investment   We need a proper industrial strategy that focuses on improving productivity  rewarding hard working people with higher wages and creating more opportunities for young people so that  whatever their background  they go as far as their talents will take them   May said ahead of the meeting   The challenge is to find a formula that arrests a decades long decline in Britain s manufacturing sector by helping firms tackle the challenges posed by globalization without blunting the market forces that make them competitive  She will make a priority of developing the industries already based in Britain   a push that could help carmakers like Jaguar Land Rover  NS TAMO   GM owned Vauxhall  N GM  and Nissan  T 7201   and aerospace industry leaders like BAE Systems  L BAES  to weather the Brexit storm  The strategy will also involve finding new ways to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on the services sector  and ensure wealth is distributed away from the prosperous south east of England  Whilst policy detail is scarce  the strategy is likely to combine state backed investment in traditional infrastructure like roads and rail with funding for modern essentials like broadband and lower energy costs  along with a push to train more of the highly skilled workers industry says it needs   NOT PICKING WINNERS Industrial policy has a toxic legacy in Britain  It was once used to help failing national champions through a series of flawed policies in the 1960s and 1970s that sought to arrest a decline in manufacturing influence    We re not getting into the business of picking winners  it s more about creating the right environment   a government source who spoke on condition of anonymity said  May s office said the strategy would promote a range of industrial sectors with a focus on addressing long term productivity growth  encouraging innovation and focusing on the industries and technologies that give Britain a competitive advantage   May surprised French utility EDF  PA EDF  and China last week with a last minute decision to review the building of Britain s first nuclear plant in decades  The refocusing of Britain s economic policy  for the last six years aimed at balancing the books and heavily reliant on foreign money to replace state infrastructure spending  also carries a potentially huge political prize  With the opposition Labour Party  long seen as the champions of the working classes  locked in a vicious internal ideological struggle and losing sway in their traditional heartlands  May has an opportunity to won over those who saw voting  Leave  in the EU referendum a  nothing to lose  protest vote   The Brexit vote and euroscepticism was strongest in former manufacturing areas  where the industry has gone  the good jobs have gone and people feel disaffected   said David Bailey Professor of Industry at Aston Business School

103282,324797,TTM,Jaguar Land Rover sues Chinese automaker over Evoque copycat  source,news,"By Jake Spring
BEIJING  Reuters    Jaguar Land Rover is suing Chinese automaker Jiangling Motor for allegedly copying the British firm s Range Rover Evoque  a person with direct knowledge of the matter said   a rare move by a foreign automaker to fight copycats in the world s biggest autos market 
A spokesman for JLR  owned by India s Tata Motors  NS TAMO   said in brief emailed comments to Reuters that a court in Beijing s eastern Chaoyang district  served Jiangling with newly filed actions surrounding copyright and unfair competition   He declined to elaborate 
The suit relates to Jiangling s Landwind X7 sport utility vehicle copying the design of the Evoque  JLR s first China made model that went on sale last year  said the person with knowledge of the legal proceedings  who is not authorized to talk to the media and didn t want to be named 
A spokesman for Landwind declined to comment 
Despite widespread and often blatant copying  global automakers generally don t take legal action in China as they feel the odds of winning against local firms are low  Also  a lawsuit can be bad for branding if the Chinese public think a foreign company is bullying domestic competitors 
If JLR wins its case  it could prompt other automakers to also take legal action  said Chen Jihong  a Beijing based lawyer at Zhong Lun Law Firm  speeding up a shift to stronger enforcement of intellectual property rights 
CLOSE RESEMBLANCE
Landwind unveiled a new version of its X7 SUV in November 2014  drawing criticism for its striking likeness to the Evoque  an imported version of which was already on sale in China 
The two SUVs have a similar shape  with the roof and windows tapering from front to back  and near identical tail lights and character lines on the side paneling  The X7 s front grille is slightly more rounded than the hard edges of the Evoque 
The slight differences between the two cars can be virtually eliminated using widely available kits that allow a Range Rover grille  logo and Land Rover badges to be put on an X7  Kits on  Alibaba  s  N BABA  Taobao shopping website cost around 128 yuan   13 39  
The X7 costs around a third of the price of an Evoque  and is some way behind in technology and performance  said Yale Zhang  managing director of Automotive Foresight 
JLR and Jiangling have agreed that Landwind will not sell the X7 in Brazil  the source said  where it recently appointed an importer  The two automakers are also discussing what Landwind can and can t do in any X7 design update  the person said 
JLR sales fell by a fifth in China in January March of last year   when it launched its China made Evoque   after rising 36 percent in the same 2014 period  In the same period this year  JLR s China sales rose 19 percent 
A lawsuit could be a long and grueling process 
It took Honda Motor  T 7267   for example  12 years to win a case in China against a little known local automaker   for copying its best selling CR V SUV   according to a report by the official Xinhua news agency  confirmed by a Honda spokesman 
Even then  the Japanese firm was awarded only 16 million yuan   2 43 million  in compensation  It had sought 300 million yuan ",2016-06-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jaguar-land-rover-sues-chinese-automaker-over-evoque-copycat:-source-406372,406372

103288,324803,TTM,Exclusive  Jaguar Land Rover could face 1 billion pound Brexit hit   sources,news,By Costas Pitas LONDON  Reuters    Jaguar Land Rover  Britain s biggest carmaker  estimates its annual profit could be cut by 1 billion pounds   1 47 billion  by the end of the decade if Britain leaves the European Union  according to two sources familiar with the company s thinking   The worst case scenario estimate is in internal documents seen by both sources that were prepared by the firm s chief economist  David Rea  to outline the possible consequences if Britons vote to leave the world s biggest trading bloc in Thursday s referendum   It gives an insight into the level of concern at a major company about the uncertainties of a future outside the EU   The rapidly expanding firm  which traces its history back to 1922 and is headquartered in Coventry  central England  has also looked into opening a European office were Britain to quit the bloc  both sources said  It has also put on hold starting major work on a plant in Slovakia announced in December as well as negotiations on a deal to lease property at Silverstone race track because of the uncertainty surrounding Thursday s vote  they said  The 1 billion pound decline in pre tax profit by 2020 would apply if Britain returned to World Trade Organisation rules for trade with Europe  involving a 10 percent tariff on exports and an inbound tariff of roughly 4 percent on components  the sources said    It may at worst cost us about 1 billion pounds   said one of the sources when asked how Jaguar Land Rover  JLR  had phrased the wording in the 89 page report  entitled  Referendum  The View    A second source said the number had featured in an internal presentation shown to the board   The company made a 2015 16 pre tax profit of 1 6 billion pounds  JLR  which is owned by owned by India s Tata Motors  NS TAMO   sold almost a quarter of its over 520 000 cars in its largest market Europe last year  confirmed it had looked into the impact of Brexit   As part of our standard business planning process  we regularly look at macro economic and geo political developments around the world   a JLR spokesman said in an emailed statement   Like any other responsible global business  we have analyzed the impact of any potential UK departure from the EU  However  we are not discussing details of any internal business analysis   Businesses have been reluctant to talk about contingency plans for Brexit but carmaker Ford  N F   which only builds engines in Britain  said it could face tariffs of 2 7 percent on engine exports and import tariffs of up to 10 percent on incoming vehicles  according to a copy of a letter sent to employees on Monday seen by Reuters    Leave  campaigners argue that Britain should be able to negotiate a tariff less trade with France and Germany for its cars because French and German models are so popular with British drivers   DEEPLY WORRIED The work  which has been updated several times since it was first prepared for the board with input from the company s sales  marketing and tax departments last summer  features three other scenarios including Britain remaining in the single market  the second source said   The two other post Brexit scenarios look at Britain taking several years to negotiate a deal to remain in the single market or agreeing a trade deal imposing low tariffs costing JLR in the low hundreds of millions  the source said  A hit to JLR would be a big blow to Britain s resurgent car industry  which has been lauded by politicians as a sign of the country s manufacturing prowess and is on course to reach an all time production high of nearly 2 million cars by 2020   JLR  which built nearly one in three of Britain s 1 6 million cars last year  is undergoing a major expansion of its lineup  and has joined the rest of the overwhelmingly foreign owned car industry in calling on Britons to remain in the bloc  It opened a small overseas facility in Brazil last week  However  a hit to profit could impact the company s ability to fund further expansion  Some projects have been put on hold until the outcome of the referendum is clear  according to the sources   JLR fully funds its investments without support from parent Tata Motors  executives have said  The cost of investment contributed to a 40 percent decline in its 2015 16 pre tax profit   They are deeply worried about being outside of the EU   They have been holding off on meaningful expenditure   the second source said  In December  JLR sealed a deal to build a 1 billion pound plant in Slovakia with an annual output of 300 000 cars partly in a bid to help it better deal with fluctuations in the value of sterling  But the sources said construction of the factory  which could become vital for JLR s European businesses if a vote for Brexit brought new trade tariffs  has yet to start  The sources also said a decision on Silverstone had been delayed until after the referendum   EUROPEAN OFFICE JLR could open an office in Brussels were Britain to leave the EU to maintain influence with European policymakers  both sources said  with the first source saying Luxembourg was also an option  That source said JLR could make the office its European headquarters but the second source said JLR would retain its British HQ   A spokesman at the firm said   Jaguar Land Rover is a British company and our headquarters will remain in the UK   JLR is Britain s biggest builder of high end and premium models and is one of the many small and premium automakers benefiting from more lenient EU rules including on emissions  due to low sales volumes compared to mass manufacturers    Having an office close to Brussels would allow them to maintain influence post any deal   the second source said   CEO Ralph Speth  who has consistently spoken out in favor of continued EU membership  wrote to workers on Monday warning of the possible consequences of a Brexit on the firm   It is inevitable that we would face increasing and higher tariffs  making our products less competitive in Europe   he said in a copy of the letter seen by Reuters

103298,324813,TTM,Port Talbot closure would tear hole in UK manufacturing supply chain,news,"By Andy Bruce and Costas Pitas PORT TALBOT  Wales LONDON  Reuters    The closure of Tata Steel s operations in Britain would leave a hole in manufacturers  supply chains  dealing a blow to thousands of smaller firms across the country and creating a logistical headache for the car industry   India s Tata Steel  Britain s biggest producer  put all of its operations up for sale  including the country s largest steelworks at Port Talbot which is losing  1 4 million a day due to depressed steel prices and high costs  As the government searches for a new buyer  some of Tata s customers are already looking for new sources of steel which is used in everything from car roofs to Heinz baked bean cans  cladding on Ikea buildings and some of the country s coins  While bigger names have the luxury of a global supply chain to fall back on  smaller companies   which account for around 95 percent of British manufacturing firms   face a tougher task if Port Talbot in south Wales closes  Tata sells around half of its products into the domestic market  the firm said in 2014   It would be entirely undesirable from my point of view   said Tony Mullins  executive chairman of QRL Radiators Group  a Tata Steel customer that makes heating radiators near the Welsh town of Newport  employing around 150 staff  Looking abroad for steel would leave firms like QRL that use British steel exposed to swings in the currency exchange rate and higher transportation costs  It might also need to hold more stock if it is buying from the other side of the world  having an impact on working capital    We have to be competitive  we have to produce quality products  and historically with Tata that has been possible for us   Mullins said   DRIVING FORCE Britain  the birthplace of the modern steel industry  has been struggling to compete since its post war heyday and has shed thousands of jobs in recent years   Since 2001 imported supplies have met more than half of its domestic demand  according to the International Steel Statistics Bureau  ISSB   as local producers struggled with high energy costs  green taxes and fierce competition   Germany is the biggest foreign supplier of steel to British manufacturers and construction firms  followed by China  Spain  Belgium and the Netherlands  the ISSB said   The government maintains that the main problem is the collapse in the price of steel  China has flooded European markets with relatively cheap steel as a result of its own falling demand  Britain imported 826 000 tonnes of Chinese steel in 2015  up from 361 000 two years earlier  according to industry data   According to the ISSB  China has produced more steel in the last three years than Britain has since the industrial revolution   Those British steelmakers that remain have been kept going by local manufacturers  a resurgent car industry and foreign demand    Hot rolled coil is produced  at Port Talbot  and that predominately goes into the automotive sector     that s the bodywork   Dominic King  head of policy and representation at industry group UK Steel  told Reuters  Five carmakers built almost 99 percent of Britain s 1 6 million cars last year and all source steel from Port Talbot  with some already looking for alternatives should the site shut   The country s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover  JLR   NS TAMO   which made just under a third of national output last year  gets around 30 percent of its steel from the site while Nissan  which operates Britain s biggest single car plant in northern England  buys 45 percent from there   Showing the cost constraints within the industry  John Leech  who heads up the automotive team at KPMG and works with some of the country s biggest carmakers  said JLR could not afford to give preferential treatment to a more expensive product even though it is owned by Tata Motors  NS TAMO    part of the same family of companies as Tata Steel    To compete against BMW and Mercedes  Jaguar Land Rover needs to makes sure its cars are cost competitive and that means using materials that are sourced cheaply and competitively   JLR said   Like all other independent businesses  we make our own purchasing decisions based on the right commercial reasons   The firm said it continued to use Tata Steel and did not see any short term impact on its business  A spokesman at General Motors owned  N GM  Vauxhall  which uses Tata s high strength lightweight steel in its Astra hatchback model said it was  considering the scenario of UK steel plant closures on supply sources     There are a number of sources of steel in Europe that are used by our plants in Spain  Germany and Poland   the spokesman said  when asked whether the firm was looking elsewhere   Leech said timing could be key  with Tata Steel saying it wants to exit Britain as soon as possible        It will mean a lot of fast footwork behind the scenes but    the ability to get the same steel from other European or Chinese plants in  a one to three month  time frame is a possibility   he said  BUY BRITISH For many of the workers leaving the Port Talbot plant at the end of their shift this week the news has come as a shock  given the investment made under Tata s ownership    Tata certainly have influenced training more than the old regime     said Dave Bowyer  59  a steelworker for 40 years and Unite union representative  whose ancestors were steelworkers        The workforce itself has become far more technical  Our craftsman and production guys  even the guys on the shop floor   a number of them have got degrees   UK Steel s King said there were many advantages to the British product which continue to attract buyers    One is customer service  that you have that close link with the manufacturer    you know in the UK that they are going to be meeting the energy targets  the environmental targets that are out there  and  that engineering skill   he said  The industry is also known for its highly skilled flexible workforce with no strike action in 30 years   Rollo Reid  technical director and grandson of the founder of REIDsteel  one of Britain s largest steel construction companies which sources almost 90 percent of its steel from Tata  worries that if Port Talbot closes  prices will rise   
 There will be one less competitor and when the other European ones go out of business  there will be less competitors and then the price will go up and we ll be completely within the hands of the Chinese  ",2016-04-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/port-talbot-closure-would-tear-hole-in-uk-manufacturing-supply-chain-393222,393222

High Earnings Yield Stocks to Boost Your PortfolioWhen you are unsure whether to keep your money in stocks or bonds  one key financial metric that can come to your rescue is earnings yield  It is the inverse of the price to earnings  P E  ratio and very useful for spotting undervalued stocks  Also  the ratio comes in handy for investors when they want to compare stocks with the market or fixed income securities Earnings Yield can be calculated as  Annual Earnings per Share Market Price  x 100  It is useful in comparing a stock with other stocks as well as with fixed income securities  While comparing similar stocks  the one which gives high earnings yield should provide better returns This ratio is also useful for comparing the performance of a market with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index is higher than the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be regarded as undervalued in comparison to bonds  This implies that investing in the stock market is a better choice for a value investor However  while T bills are free of risks  investing in stocks always comes with a caveat  Hence  it would be an excellent idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the

103327,324842,TTM,Here s Why FCAU Withdrew Its Proposal To Merge With Renault,opinion,"The May 27 proposal to merge Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   NYSE FCAU   with Renault  PA RENA  was just too good to be true  Not only would the  35 billion deal seen the emergence of the third largest automaker in the world with annual vehicle sales of 8 7 million units  but it would also have allowed the two to manage 5 billion euros in cost synergies  including a billion for Renault s Japanese partner Nissan  by saving purchasing cost and splitting electric and autonomous car R D 
With minimal product overlap  FCAU s popular Jeep and Ram brands also complement perfectly Renault s leadership in autonomous and electrified vehicles  where FCAU needs a much stronger footing  
But there were challenges right at the outset that proved to be too big to overcome 
The first was with respect to the French government  which has a 15  ownership in Renault 
The second was Renault s  15  owned by Nissan  alliance with Nissan  40   owned by Renault  and Mitsubishi  controlling share owned by Nissan   That s how complicated it is 
The Problem with the French Government 
The government started out wanting that there should be no job losses in the country  that no French plant should be shut down and that a dividend is paid to Renault shareholders as part of the deal  Later  it started specifying things like the location of the merged company s headquarters as well as board representation  Plus of course partner Nissan s active support 
To be fair  some Renault shareholders also had reservations  Paris based activist investment manager CIAM for instance sent a letter to Renault s board  saying that the deal significantly undervalued Renault and that its shareholders deserved the 2 5 billion euro   2 8 billion  dividend promised to FCAU shareholders 
The Problem with Nissan 
 The company is not averse to the deal  as long as it is able to retain some of its EV IP  It would probably also like to raise its stake in Renault so it can have more of a say in the alliance 
The Result
When the proposal was put to vote  all the French directors were in favor  Nissan abstained  likely because of its unsolved issues with Renault  The government voted against the deal because it wanted more time to fly to Japan and convince Nissan s top brass that it was a good deal 
At about this time  FCAU pulled out  likely because Nissan  and its leadership in EV  was probably an important consideration in the first place  So if it decided to hang on to its IP  the deal didn t make sense 
So unfortunately  it was left with making a statement to the public 
 FCA remains firmly convinced of the compelling  transformational rationale of a proposal that has been widely appreciated since it was submitted  the structure and terms of which were carefully balanced to deliver substantial benefits to all parties  However it has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully

103328,324843,TTM,The Latest Numbers Tell Us That The Global Economic Slowdown Is Accelerating Drama,opinion,"Economists are already predicting  the world s lowest growth in a decade   but it is beginning to look like what we will be facing will be much worse than that   In recent days  numbers have been coming in from all over the planet that are absolutely abysmal   The  global economic slowdown  is rapidly transitioning into a new global economic crisis  and central banks seem powerless to stop what is happening   They have already pushed interest rates to the floor  actually below the floor in many cases   and over the past decade they have absolutely flooded the global economy with new money   But despite all of this unprecedented intervention  economic conditions are deteriorating at a pace that is breathtaking 
Let s start by taking a look at what is happening in India   According to CNN  vehicle sales in India fell a whopping 31 percent in July 
Just two years ago  India s huge car market was booming and global players were rushing to invest  Now it s been slammed into reverse 

Sales of passenger vehicles plunged 31  in July  according to figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  SIAM  on Tuesday  It s the ninth straight month of declines and the sharpest one month drop in more than 18 years  SIAM Director General Vishnu Mathur told CNN Business 
Those are numbers you would expect to see if we were in the middle of a full blown economic depression  and it is being projected that this downturn  could result in a million people being laid off  
The slump has prompted companies to slash over 330 000 jobs through the closing of car dealerships and cutbacks at component manufacturers  Mathur said  citing data from industry associations that govern those two sectors 
The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India warned in a statement last month that its  crisis like situation  could result in a million people being laid off 
A million jobs is very serious 
And we are talking about just one industry in one country 
How many jobs will ultimately be lost all over the world in the months ahead 
Over in China  the auto industry is also deeply struggling 

China s Geely  OTC GELYF  revealed this week that its net profit probably plunged by 40  in the first half of the year as the world s second largest economy slowed  In June alone  its car sales fell 29  
That isn t supposed to happen in China 
For decades  China has been one of the primary engines of global economic growth  but now things have changed dramatically 
Perhaps you can blame the trade war for what is happening in China  but the auto industry is also in big trouble in Europe   In fact  some of the biggest automakers in the world are closing European factories and ruthlessly slashing jobs 

Ford is cutting 12 000 jobs and closing six plants in Europe  including an engine factory in the United Kingdom  Jaguar Land Rover  which is owned by India s  Tata Motors   NYSE TTM   is slashing 4 500 jobs  Honda is also closing a plant in the United Kingdom 
If those companies expected the European economy to bounce back in the foreseeable future  they would not be making such moves 
But just like you and I  they can see what is happening to Europe s economy  and on Monday we just received some more deeply troubling news   The following comes from Zero Hedge 

Weakness in euro area manufacturing hit a climax this morning as German private sector activity plunged to a seven year low  The Germany Manufacturing PMI slumped in September  dropping to 41 4  down from 44 7 in August  printing below the lowest sellside estimate  consensus of 44 4   worse  the German manufacturing recession is now spreading to the services sector  where the formerly resilient services PMI also slumped from 54 8 to 52 5  also missing the lowest analyst estimate  and collectively  resulting in the first composite PMI print below 50  or 49 1 to be precise  since April 2013  The rate of decline was one of the sharpest in seven years 
It appears that the German economy has already entered recession territory  and these new numbers are not causing anyone to be optimistic 
In fact   abysmal  is hardly strong enough to describe these absolutely horrible figures 
Flash Germany PMI Composite Output Index  1  at 49 1  Aug  51 7   83 month low 
Flash Germany Services PMI Activity Index 2  at 52 5  Aug  54 8   9 month low Flash Germany Manufacturing PMI 3  at 41 4  Aug  43 5   123 month low Flash Germany Manufacturing Output Index 4  at 42 7  Aug  45 8   86 month low Of course the U S  economy has been slowing down for quite some time now  and if you doubt this  I encourage you to read  about our economy that I posted earlier this month 
We haven t seen economic conditions like this in the United States since the depths of the Great Recession  and many believe that what is coming will be far worse than the last time around 
And we may be deep into the coming crisis far sooner than many were expecting   In fact  David Rosenberg of Gluskin Sheff is adamant that there is  a recession coming in the next 12 months  
David Rosenberg  the Gluskin Sheff chief economist and strategist  is warning that a recession is coming  Rosenberg says economic growth in the United States will turn negative sooner than most investors anticipate and the Federal Reserve is powerless 
Even if the central bank lowers interest rates to zero  a recession will still grip the U S  within 12 months  Rosenberg predicts   There s a recession coming in the next 12 months  he stated with fact last Thursday on CNBC s  Futures Now  The Fed just lowered its benchmark interest rate last Wednesday by a quarter point and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled rates would only be cut again if there s new evidence the economy is softening 
If things really start to deteriorate in the months ahead  we could be in the midst of a horrible economic downturn by the time the U S  presidential election rolls around 
Let us hope that is not the case  but right now things certainly do not look good for the U S  economy or for the global economy as a whole ",2019-09-24,Michael T.

So  what are the chances of Indian stocks scaling higher  Let s find out 
Key Risks 
As per an article published on   about half of the stocks in the S P BSE 500 Index are pricier than their average five year price to earnings figure   Highest proportion of stocks  are  trading above their historical valuations in 15 years  
So  brokerage houses like IIFL see muted returns from India investing  going forward  Head of research Asia at  also believes   mid cap stocks are extremely expensive in India compared to large caps  
As per an article published on CNNMoney  excessive red tape is another cause  apart from high valuation  that has probably discouraged Buffett from investing in India  Though such roadblocks are likely to get cleared  it is taking longer than expected  a per the source  
Can the Rally Outrun Risks 
With some of the tailwinds still in place  investors can play India ETFs in the near term  but with a little more caution  With oil prices sliding below  50  despite OPEC output cut deal  on higher U S  drilling  the Indian market has reasons to rejoice  Lower oil prices should bode well for India as the country is a big importer of crude  read

103405,324920,TTM,Goodyear  GT  Beats Q3 Earnings  Sales Miss Estimates,opinion,"The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   NASDAQ GT   reported a 18 2  increase in adjusted earnings per share to  1 17 in third quarter 2016 from 99 cents recorded a year ago  all excluding special items   Moreover  earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Adjusted net income surged 14 4  to  310 million from  271 million in third quarter 2015

Original equipment unit volume went down 15  year over year  Replacement tire shipments were down 6   Segment operating income plunged 19  to  305 million due to the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary and lower volume 
Revenues from the Europe  Middle East and Africa segment were  1 24 billion  down 7  year over year  Revenues were primarily hurt by 5  decrease in sales volume resulting from the company s original equipment sales strategy and increased competition for smaller rim diameter consumer tires  Original equipment unit volume was down 8   and replacement tire shipments declined 3  year over year  Segment operating income edged down 1  to  152 million  primarily due to lower volume Revenues from the Asia Pacific segment rose 18  to  541 million  driven by higher tire unit volume  partially offset by unfavorable price mix  Original equipment unit volume surged 16   while replacement tire shipments soared 47  year over year  Segment operating income improved 38  to  99 million  primarily due to higher volume 
The NGY acquisition positively impacted volumes by 1 3 million units and sales by  48 million

103468,324983,TTM,No Longer Going Viral  Tata Motors  Zica  Not Zika  Is Now The Tiago,opinion,"Tata Motors   N TTM  marketing division is breathing a bit easier these days 
Earlier this month  MetalMiner reported that one of India s auto majors was suddenly saddled with a name problem for a key  new product  Its latest hatchback  named Zica  launched recently  sounded similar to the dreaded virus Zika 
The top honchos at India s fifth biggest automaker  which owns the Jaguar and Land Rover brands  went into a huddle  wondering how they would be able to tackle the branding problem  Now  after an interesting exercise  the car has had an image makeover and has been renamed  officially  as Tiago  And  yes  this is the same car which is being endorsed by none other than world soccer player of the year Lionel Messi 
From Zica to Tiago
For months  the marketing division spent thousands of dollars promoting the former Zica s  now Tiago  promotional activities  until that pesky Zika virus came along and infected not just its victims  but Zica s worldwide brand value

 Empathizing with the hardships being caused by the recent Zika virus outbreak across many countries  Tata Motors  as a socially responsible company  has decided to re brand the car   the company said in a statement 

The Tiago will cost about  5 800 and will come in gasoline engine and diesel versions  Tata Motors will apply for regulatory registrations  with the aim of formally launching Tiago to the market by the end of March  it said in a statement 
Still Fantastico 
So  how did the auto major zero in on the name Tiago  Here s how  The Tata Tiago name was chosen after a global crowd sourcing competition called   FantasticoNameHunt  was conducted in which fans got to vote for their preferred new name from a shortlist of 3 suggestions   Tiago  Adore  and Civet  Tiago beat the other two 
Auto analysts are hopeful that the name change may yet save the day for this new hatchback  after it was launched at the Auto Expo in New Delhi earlier in February  Zica  by the way  stood for  zippy car  ",2016-02-25,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-longer-going-viral,-tata-motors’-zica-(not-zika)-is-now-the-tiago-200119454",200119454
103469,324984,TTM,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love Tata Motors  TTM ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Tata Motors Limited   NYSE TTM   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for TTM s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for Tata MotorsA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 8 9  compared to an industry average of  0 8   TTM is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for Tata MotorsWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of TTM  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 13 0  to 3 1  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 64 3   Clearly  TTM is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors TATA MOTORS ADR Price   TTM Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with TTM  as of late too Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate has gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 1 estimate has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago TTM was expected to post earnings of  3 12 share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  3 60 for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have TTM as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep TTM on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-09-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-tata-motors-(ttm)-200151555,200151555
103470,324985,TTM,7 Stocks With Recent Price Strength Set To Gain Further,opinion,In the stock market  finding a win win strategy is easier said than done  No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to the better of them  A few lucky ones rake in the moolah but others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could take resort to the commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  But this bears the risk of disappointment as one could fall into the value trap if the selected stock s hidden weakness is not identified In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price  So  how about looking for the current winners that have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently witnessed a price increase  Actually  stocks that have recently seen price strength have high chances of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers  So  looking at those that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves sounds rational Nevertheless  recent price strength alone cannot do the trick  Club together other relevant parameters in your game plan to get the optimum return on your investment Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Here are seven of the 11 stocks

103528,325043,TTM,Is The Stock Market Cheap ,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1618 77  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1606 28  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet TTM P E ratio   17 6  17 5 P E10 ratio   23 0  22 8 The Valuation Thesis  A standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias  TTM P E Ratio The  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the  The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits   as high as the 120s   in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500 Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation  The P E10 Ratio Legendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book    They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested 5  7 or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of   has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation  The Correlation between the S P Composite and its P E10 As the chart below illustrates  the P E10 closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  In fact  the correlation between the two since 1881  the year when the first decade of average earnings is available  is 0 77   Note  A perfect positive correlation would be 1 and the absence of correlation would be 0   The historic P E10 average is 16 5  After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the ratio rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of 2011  and then hovered in the 20 to 21 range  The latest ratio is now close to same level as 2011 interim high  The ratio in the chart above is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices for the index   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10  Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits Where does the current valuation put us For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles   five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile  from the bottom  in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  hovered around that boundary and has now moved higher  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 39  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 49 to two decimal places   Last month it was 42  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is 23 0  above trend  Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 88th percentile of the 1590 data points in this series A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the lowest quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 550  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now in its 13th year Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  and certainly the new nominal all time high set at last month is a conspicuous tick mark for the optimists  But the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to access the Standard   Poor s earnings spreadsheet Go to the S P 500 page on the  website  Here is a   to the page Click the  ADDITIONAL INFO

103549,325064,TTM,UPDATE 4 Britain offers 2 3 bln pound car industry aid,news," Adds reaction 
 By Frank Prenesti and Adrian Croft
 LONDON  Jan 27  Reuters    Britain pledged on Tuesday to
guarantee up to 2 3 billion pounds   3 25 billion  of loans to
help its ailing car industry cope with a slump in demand that
has cost thousands of jobs 
 The government also announced 35 million pounds of new funds
for training in the British car industry  which suffered its
sharpest fall in output in nearly 20 years last month 
 The battered car industry cautiously welcomed the news  but
the opposition Conservatives mocked the limited scale of
measures to be funded by money already set aside by the
government 
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown has already announced tens of
billions of aid for the crisis hit banking sector and billions
more to try to kickstart the recession hit economy 
 As the centrepiece of the car package  the government will
guarantee up to 1 3 billion pounds of auto industry loans from
the European Investment Bank 
 It will guarantee a further billion pounds of loans to fund
investments ineligible for support from the European lender 
Business Secretary Peter Mandelson told parliament 
 Mandelson said it was not a bailout  but the British car
industry was in the  front line of the downturn  and the
government had to act to prevent an irreversible loss of
capacity  skills and technology 
  For the future  Britain needs an economy with less
financial engineering and more real engineering   he said 
referring to efforts to reduce Britain s reliance on the
financial services industry 
 The British motor industry is now largely foreign owned  but
still employs more than 800 000 people in total 
 Britain is one of a number of European countries considering
measures to help the auto industry after the credit crunch and a
global downturn slashed demand 
 The U S  government is being pushed to provide more help to
produce fuel efficient cars  It gave  17 billion in December to
bail out General Motors Corp and Chrysler 

 CAUTIOUS WELCOME
 The government said trade minister Mervyn Davies would draw
up a plan to improve access to credit for manufacturers 
financing arms 
  The industry welcomes the fact that the government is
taking the matter seriously  but the devil will be in the
detail   said a spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders 
 David Smith  chief executive of luxury carmaker Jaguar Land
Rover  owned by India s Tata Motors  said the government had
recognised the car industry s strategic economic importance  but
he also wanted to see the details 
 Conservative business spokesman Kenneth Clarke said
Mandelson s announcement was a letdown   Someone has said to
 the business ministry  we cannot afford anything but modest
loan guarantees   he said 
 The Conservatives  who lead Brown s Labour Party in opinion
polls  have accused the government of embarking on an
irresponsible borrowing spree to counter the downturn 
 Mandelson will meet industry representatives on Wednesday to
discuss the measures  which he said were aimed at helping
Britain become a leader in developing low carbon vehicles 
 Groups such as Nissan Motor Co  Honda Motor Co and Ford
Motor Co have major plants in Britain 
 Nissan said this month it would cut 1 200 jobs at its
Sunderland plant in northeast England  while Jaguar Land Rover
has announced 450 job cuts

103550,325065,TTM,UPDATE 1 Jaguar Land Rover to cut 300 jobs  slows production,news,"  Tata owned group blames cuts on weakness in car market
   Says still talking to government about loan guarantees
 
 By John Bowker 
 LONDON  July 15  Reuters    British luxury carmaker Jaguar
Land Rover will cut 300 jobs from its Halewood plant in the
north of England and stop production of its X Type car due to
the downturn in the auto industry 
  Our industry has been especially badly hit by the recession
and the premium sector more than others  Jaguar Land Rover s
retail sales fell by 28 percent in the past 10 months   Chief
Executive David Smith said in a statement 
 The company  owned by India s Tata Motors  said it would not
close the Halewood plant    which employs 2 000 staff and also
makes the Land Rover Freelander    but would shut it down
temporarily for about three weeks 
 A spokesman said the group was still in talks with the
government over a loan guarantee for a 340 million euro   477 6
million  hand out from the European Investment Bank    approved
earlier this year 
  We are hopeful for a speedy and successful conclusion   a
spokesman said 
 Tata Motors said last month that Jaguar Land Rover made an
after tax loss of 306 million pounds   501 5 million  in the 10
months to end March  when it also warned of further job cuts 
 However  the company pressed ahead with the launch of the
high end Jaguar XJ model last week  hosting a glitzy London
party attended by Australian model Elle McPherson and the actor
David Hasselhoff

103552,325067,TTM,Chinese Regulator Fines Audi  Chrysler In Anti Monopoly Probe,news,"By    A Chinese regulator imposed hefty fines on foreign automobile manufacturers Audi and Chrysler on Thursday after they were found guilty of violating the country s anti monopoly laws in August  according to media reports 
The Chinese government  imposing a fine of  40 5 million on Volkswagen s Audi AG  ETR NSU  and  5 2 million on Fiat s Chrysler  reportedly said that the two companies had violated the law by fixing the prices of vehicles and spare parts with dealers 
The penalty has raised the possibility of similar fines being levied on other automobile manufacturers such as Daimler AG s  OTCMKTS DDAIF  Mercedes Benz and Tata Motors Limited s NYSE TTM Jaguar Land Rover  which have also been found guilty of indulging in anti competitive behavior in the country 
In addition  the National Development and Reform Commission  or NDRC  which is heading the probe against the automobile companies  also fined three Chrysler dealerships and eight Audi dealerships after they were found complicit in fixing the prices of spare parts 
 We accept the penalty and we have been optimizing the management processes and sales and dealership structure   an Audi spokesperson told the Financial Times  A Chrysler spokesperson also told The Wall Street Journal that the company  respects and accepts the final ruling  

Since the beginning of the year  Chinese regulators have launched a series of investigations targeting foreign car manufacturers  including Mercedes  BMW  ETR BMW   Chrysler  Audi and Tata Motors  Chinese authorities have alleged that these companies had violated the 2008 Anti Monopoly Law 
Addressing allegations that China was deliberately targeting foreign companies  Xu Kunlin  a senior official at NDRC  reportedly said   We do not select which companies to look into    the consumers do the selecting  We investigate the companies where we receive well grounded complaints  ",2014-09-11,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinese-regulator-fines-audi,-chrysler-in-anti-monopoly-probe-309096",309096
103553,325068,TTM,Auto recovery wobbles in Paris show spotlight ,news,"By Laurence Frost PARIS  Reuters    Europe s anemic car market rebound could be over before it has really begun  That is the fear of executives as they gather for the Paris auto show opening on Thursday  the biggest industry event in the regional calendar 
While U S  and Japanese car sales are back at pre crisis levels  Europe is still 20 percent below its 2007 peak 
Carmakers are rolling out new models in anticipation of closing the gap    the Paris show floor will be bristling with fuel efficient small cars and compact SUVs 
But a tentative recovery following a six year slump is looking increasingly fragile  And this time there is little relief to be had elsewhere  with Chinese demand cooling  Russian sales in freefall and other emerging markets in sharp decline 
 Few plants have been closed  headcount levels remain high  and R D budgets have largely been left intact to ensure a future product pipeline   Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said   The industry is just sitting tight hoping for a brighter future  
It may have to wait a while 
At the end of this decade  European demand will still be 1 million vehicles short of its pre 2008 average  according to forecaster IHS Automotive 
 This recovery has always had shaky foundations   said IHS analyst Ian Fletcher  who sees European market growth slowing to 3 percent next year after a 4 6 percent spurt in 2014 
 It s about whether customers on the front line feel secure in their jobs and how heavily indebted they are from previous years   he said 
Carmakers that were too optimistic about the pace of this year s upturn have already been forced to cut back 
Ford  which is showing a new S Max minivan in Paris  will stop building its top selling Fiesta subcompact in Germany for 11 days in October and November 
Production of PSA Peugeot Citroen models has also outpaced sales  prompting a two week halt to assembly of the 208 and C3 small cars in Slovakia as well as 300 job cuts at its main domestic plant in eastern France 
Low cost cars offer a notable bright spot but are largely imported  leaving the region s factories with excess capacity estimated at 2 3 million vehicles a year  according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman 
Renault s budget Dacia range  the fastest growing brand in Europe with a 2 9 percent market share  will be unveiling crossover versions of its Moroccan built Lodgy and Dokker vans 
Besides the no frills range  Renault has been cushioned from the crisis by its 43 4 percent stake in Japan s Nissan  and Fiat is similarly shielded by Chrysler after taking full control of the U S  carmaker early this year 
It is Peugeot  showing small concept cars using a compressed air hybrid drivetrain developed with Bosch  ROBG UL   that is most exposed to Europe  Some 60 percent of its sales are still generated in the region and almost a third of its global production in high cost France 
DARKENING SKIES
Regional demand is  a contributor to the recovery of Peugeot  which is heavily implanted in Europe   Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Tuesday 
 We are placing our hopes in the continuation of this growth  although its weakness makes us rather cautious about whether it will last  
European auto stocks have tumbled 14 percent since June 6  based on the 14 member Stoxx Europe 600 Autos   Parts index  after doubling in value over the course of a two year rally driven by recovery hopes 
 The momentum has turned from positive in early summer to very negative right now   said Arndt Ellinghorst  a London based analyst with ISI Group 
The outlook has worsened as consumer and business confidence are  dragged down because of the whole Russian situation   Ellinghorst added 
Russian car sales were down 26 percent in August  with the rouble tumbling as the United States and Europe stepped up sanctions over Moscow s military intervention in Ukraine 
China s auto market growth is also slowing to a forecast 7 9 percent next year from 11 2 percent expected in 2014  according to IHS  That threatens to curb the bumper profits that have allowed premium carmakers BMW  Daimler and Volkswagen s Audi to ride out the crisis at home 
The German big three are challenged by the pricing fallout from their intense sales rivalry  as well as new competition from the likes of Tata s Jaguar Land Rover  whose Jaguar XE sedan makes its public debut in Paris 
European market leader Volkswagen also looks vulnerable to demand weakness at home  as it struggles to rein in cost overruns at the heartland Wolfsburg plant 
But a real rebound must happen sometime  and Bernstein s Warburton sees Europe s average vehicle age    9 years  compared with a pre crisis 7 9    among reasons to be cheerful 

 There must be some form of pent up demand building in Europe   he said in a recent note   There is clear upside for vehicle demand  if only a proper recovery gets underway

103570,325085,TTM,S P 500  Churn And Burn,opinion,T2108 Status  36 1 VIX Status  17 1General  Short term  Trading Call  Play the wedge   breakout or breakdownActive T2108 periods  Day  4 under 40   underperiod   Day  16 under 70   underperiod Commentary Incredibly  the tightening wedge on the S P 500 remains mainly intact For 10 straight trading days the S P 500 has effectively bounced between its 50DMA at support and the 20DMA as resistance  Right in the middle of the action is still the bear bull dividing line providing a neat pivot  I have redrawn the downward trend excluding Friday s action showing how in the last week this line has further constrained training  This churn is burning anyone who maintains a strong opinion on what the market  should  be doing  But space is running out in this wedge  and we should finally see a breakout or breakdown in the coming week  Conveniently  the Federal Reserve is announcing its latest on monetary policy on Wednesday which should provide a perfect catalyst to push the market into its next phase If I had to vote based on the VIX  the volatility index  I would vote for a breakdown  The VIX remains resilient and is now staying  aloft  for its longest duration of the year  For 10 of the last 11 trading days the VIX has closed above the 15 2 pivot  While the S P 500 has churned  the VIX has strengthened its resolve  This resilience should be warning us of elevated concern for a resumption of the S P 500 s correction If I had to vote based on T2108  I would vote for a breakout  On Thursday  T2108 touched 30  before launching higher and closing at 39 3   In recent years  30  has often served as a floor for T2108  not quite reaching official oversold status at 20   On Thursday  the S P 500 cracked the 50DMA by a hair before turning on a dime and bumrushing right into the downtrend line  This move frustrated a lot of bears  for a hot minute  it looked like the S P 500 would finally serve up the breakdown they have been expecting  The most entertaining sequence has come from money manager  as his tweets continue to emphasize all that is negative in the world  It is one of the best displays of confirmation bias   pick a position and look only for data that supports that position  I have noticed in recent weeks he has become particularly fond of retweeting material from  which has become notorious for supplying megaphones for permabears  Kass is also a converted fan of gold  This is just for a trade of course because at higher prices he was a very vocal gold hater  Kass has become extremely prolific on twitter and clearly spends a lot of time tweeting and reading tweets during the trading day  especially Zero Hedge pieces   Note I am NOT making fun of Kass here  I have a lot of respect for him and his consistent ability to stick firm to a contrarian viewpoint  I follow his tweets and even set it up so I get text messages on my phone  By following him so closely I have come to recognize a lot of patterns and consistent communication styles  also making me wonder what patterns I have    In particular  Kass predictably starts posting positively on the market after a sell off that takes it low enough below some price target he has and negatively on the market when it is rallying above his target  A notable exception is the cheerleading of any stock he is holding that is rallying  In THAT case  he becomes similar to the rest of us who enjoy celebrating success on twitter  I did not post examples of those tweets  However  in all the time he has been hyping gold it has mainly churned in place  little different from the  memoryless  market he complains about when referring to the S P 500  Confirmation bias is a tough habit for any of us to kick  Why care about what Kass has to say  He has a large audience of almost 63 000 followers  In the investing and trading world this is a huge sphere of influence  It has the potential to move positions in some cases  Kass is also well known for making some big market calls  especially calling a bottom in March  2009  He is a regular guest on CNBC and has a well known active love hate relationship with the infamous Jim Cramer  Most importantly  he drops nuggets of insight that serve as a check on my own biases  I just wish I could get him to answer more of my tweets to him  Anyway  sorry for the large sidetrack on Kass  but this is context to the action on Thursday  Kass fought the rally all day and in the end concluded that quants went crazy using algorithms to drive the market in the  wrong  direction  My eyes perked up because my own algorithm in the form of the T2108 Trading Model  TTM  had predicted a down day based on Wednesday s close  I was instead positioned for a rally given the TTM earlier Wednesday predicted a rally if the market had closed when I checked it intraday   See the last T2108 Update for details   Kass reminded me that my own model and algorithms are competing with others coming to their own conclusions  In Thursday s case  even the dumbest algorithm could have made one of two simple simple conclusions  1  short on the break of the 50DMA  or 2  BUY a retest of the 50DMA  The shorts got it wrong and were likely reminded that these signals are best followed AFTER a close and maybe even confirmation with follow through on the next day  Kass also thinks of technicals as voodoo although he freely picks and chooses technical perspectives that agree with his own analysis  On Thursday  I took note of his awareness of 1624 on the S P 500 as technical resistance  It easily gave way  As the chart above shows  this bear bull dividing line has quickly matured from simple support and resistance to an important pivot point  a true dividing line  I am guessing Kass would not have hated the quants so much on Thursday if their algorithms had respected this line as resistance  Anyway  I was very fortunate to make profits on my large gathering of SSO calls  I was grateful even though my early exit left about another 33  on the table by the Thursday s close  The lesson I got from this experience is that I need to run a sensitivity analysis on the T2108 Trading Model  I plan to add code to test out the robustness of the prediction if any one of the parameters deviates by a  reasonable  amount  It will be like a voting machine  for you machine learning types  think    If the preponderance of votes lean in the direction of the main prediction based on the close  I will increase my confidence in the prediction  I hope to make this adjustment in the coming weeks  In the meantime  I will stick with the current method and try to do some manual sensitivity checks that will include examining the decision tree for the classification model for any quirks that would make the current prediction prone to instability  In summary  I expect the S P 500 to break out of this wedge in the coming week  most likely driven by a Fed inspired reaction and or counter reaction  Out of respect for T2108  I am leaning bullish  but I will instantly turn bearish on a CLOSE below the 50DMA that gets follow through  NOTE WELL   I am not likely to trade on that bearishness  at least not on the S P 500  because at that point T2108 should be rapidly approaching oversold conditions  I am VERY eager to test out the TTM and my overhauled T2108 methods on oversold conditions  Just as I did not get automatically bearish with overbought conditions  thank goodness    I will not get automatically bullish with classic oversold conditions  I will run the numbers and respect the odds and the technicals  Finally  two more important trades I announced on twitter  I am again long puts on Caterpillar  CAT  that turned out well timed as CAT failed to break resistance at its 50DMA  I also dove right back into puts on First Solar  FSLR  after it cracked  45  I really should have just stuck with my previous put spread and stayed as patient as I was coming into the sell off   they

103591,325106,TTM,UPDATE 5 Ford abandons Mazda control with 20 pct stake sale,news,"  Ford to raise  538 million as scrambles for cash
   To remain top Mazda shareholder with 13 pct
   Strategic relationship to continue
   Ford  with Chrysler and GM  seeking US govt lifeline
  Adds share buyback method 
 By Chang Ran Kim  Asia autos correspondent
 TOKYO  Nov 18  Reuters    Ford Motor Co  scrambling for cash
as the U S  Big Three automakers struggle to stay alive  will end
12 years of control of Mazda Motor Corp through the sale of a 20
percent stake in the Japanese carmaker for around  540 million 
 Ford will remain Mazda s top shareholder with a stake of just
over 13 percent 
 Mazda  in which Ford first took a stake in 1979  said on
Tuesday it would buy back 6 87 percent of its own shares from
Ford for up to 17 9 billion yen   185 million   keeping them as
treasury stock  More than 20 undisclosed business partners will
purchase the remaining 13 percent  Mazda said 
 Reeling from slowing sales  Detroit s General Motors Corp 
Ford and Chrysler LLC are desperately trying to raise cash to
survive in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression 
Executives from all three are expected to amplify their calls for
a financial lifeline from the U S  government at Congressional
hearings beginning on Tuesday 
 As part of the ownership change  Mazda said two board members
   Chief Financial Officer David Friedman and sales and marketing
chief Daniel Morris    would return to Ford  Executive Vice
President Philip Spender will remain 
 Mazda Chief Executive Hisakazu Imaki    the first Japanese
CEO after a string of four Ford executives at the helm since 1996
   will cede his post to another executive vice president 
Takashi Yamanouchi  to become chairman of the board 
 All personnel changes will take effect on Wednesday 
 Slowing auto sales and the global financial crisis have sent
shares of Ford plunging and led to a worse than expected  2 98
billion operating loss in the latest quarter 
 The two firms  which share vehicle platforms and engineering
resources and jointly own assembly plants in the United States 
Thailand and China  will keep their strategic ties  Imaki told a
news conference at Mazda headquarters in Hiroshima  monitored in
Tokyo 
  The sale of Mazda shares by our partner  Ford  will not
result in any change in Mazda s strategic direction   Imaki  who
turns 66 next month  said   We will continue our strategic
relationship through our ongoing joint ventures with Ford  as
well as the sharing of platforms and powertrains  
 Since raising its stake in Mazda to a controlling 33 4
percent in 1996  Ford has rescued the carmaker from the brink 
helping it to restore its brand image through strong  stylish
products such as the Mazda6 Atenza and Mazda3 Axela 
 In return  Ford has benefited by tapping Mazda s strength in
the development of smaller cars 
  This agreement allows Ford to raise capital that will help
fund our product led transformation  and at the same time  allows
Ford and Mazda to continue our successful strategic relationship
in the best interest of both companies   Ford CEO Alan Mulally
said in a statement released by Mazda 
 Analysts have said they expected little short term change to
the relationship between Ford and Mazda given their closely
intertwined operations and platform sharing 
 Some said having a more stable set of shareholders could be
positive for Mazda  although the arrangement would leave its
balance sheet  already on the weak side  slightly weaker 
  It s not the ideal solution from anyone   said an analyst at
a Western brokerage  declining to be named 
  From a strategic perspective there s not much change  but it
was a desperate move by Ford  selling at this low price  and
Mazda had no choice but to buy back part of it because they
couldn t find enough buyers  
 Mazda  which had cash or cash equivalents worth 215 billion
yen at the end of September  said it would use its own funds to
buy back the shares at Tuesday s closing price of 184 yen  It
will buy the shares in off hours trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange before the market opens on Wednesday 
 Earlier this year  Ford sold the premium Jaguar and Land
Rover brands to India s Tata Motors Ltd and is said to be looking
for a buyer for its Volvo Cars arm 
 Ford has promised to keep the remaining 13 percent stake for
the time being  Imaki said 
 Mazda s shares jumped on an earlier Nikkei business daily
report that the announcement could come on Tuesday  The stock
ended the day 6 4 percent higher at 184 yen 
 Imaki declined to disclose the other buyers  but media
reports have named trading houses Sumitomo Corp and Itochu Corp 
auto parts maker Denso Corp and non life insurance companies
including Tokio Marine Holdings Inc among the possible buyers 
 A day earlier  GM said it would sell the remaining 3 percent
it held in Suzuki Motor Corp for  232 million 
 That transaction was completed on Tuesday

103592,325107,TTM,Britain says will do all it can to help carmakers,news,"LONDON  Dec 19  Reuters    The British government wants to
help the car industry through the economic downturn but the main
responsibility lies with the carmakers  owners  Prime Minister
Gordon Brown said on Friday 
 Speculation has grown this week that the government is about
to step in to support car manufacturers as the credit crunch
takes its toll on industry 
  We want to do everything we can to help the car industry
through these difficult times   Brown told a news conference 
 He said it was  very important to recognise that the first
responsibility for the running of a particular company lies with
the company itself  
  We are happy to debate these issues with the car industry
but I m not able     to announce any particular decisions
today   he said 
 Brown s comments came as Derek Simpson  joint general
secretary of the Unite union  urged the government to provide
short term financial assistance to Britain s car industry before
Christmas 
  Only action by the Treasury in the next few days will
safeguard the tens of thousands of jobs and the many communities
across the country depending on car manufacturing for their
livelihoods   Simpson said in a statement 
 The United States announced a  17 4 billion loan package to
rescue its stricken auto makers on Friday 
 Business minister Peter Mandelson confirmed this week that
he had held talks with luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover  which
he said was under  particular strain  
 He said the government  which has added billions of pounds
to the national debt by nationalising or taking stakes in
several banks  did not have an open cheque book 
 Tata Motors Ltd  India s top vehicle maker  only completed
the  2 3 billion acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford
Motor Co in June 
 New car registrations in Britain plunged 36 8 percent on the
year in November  the steepest decline in nearly three decades 
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said 
 British car dealer Lookers issued a profit warning on Friday
and scrapped its final dividend  blaming increasingly tough
trading conditions in both new and used car markets 
 The warning follows similar alerts from rivals Inchcape and
Pendragon as Britons cut back discretionary spending due to
fears of recession and rising unemployment 
 Paul Everitt  chief executive of the SMMT  the British car
industry s trade group  said after a meeting with Mandelson last
month that the industry faced  unprecedented difficulties in the
market place  
 Saying there was an urgent need to address liquidity and
restore demand  he said government and industry had agreed to
look at a range of solutions

103615,325130,TTM,Quasi Oversold Conditions Accelerate,opinion,T2108 Status  33 9   3rd straight day of quasi oversold conditions VIX Status  17 5General  Short term  Trading Call  If short  close out position  Otherwise  accumulate long position Active T2108 periods  40  overperiod ended at 32 days  Day  1 under 40   underperiod   Day  10 under 70   underperiod Commentary Tuesday s missed opportunity turned into yesterday s missed bonanza  The S P 500 broke clean through the bear bull dividing line to lose 1 4   The quasi oversold scenario I described yesterday unfold almost exactly as I had envisioned it  a break of support  a plunge toward 50DMA support  and a close below the lower Bollinger Band   These conditions alone put the index in an  over stretched  position  T2108 is blaring quasi oversold on its 4th consecutive day of losses  three quasi oversold conditions in a row  The last time something similar happened was in mid February  this was the time I first explored the power and potential of quasi oversold conditions  A sustained rally began the next day  HOWEVER  this trend is now VERY easy to see  especially the retests of the 50DMA and subsequent rallies  Odds are against this 4th time being a charm  but I followed the rules of quasi oversold anyway  I started into a FIRST tranche of Pro Shares Ultra S P 500  SSO  calls   The T2108 Trading Model  TTM  projects an 81  chance of a bounce today  Interestingly  the decision tree in the model branches only on the value of the VIX  the volatility index  Since 1990  there have been 31 occasions where the VIX has closed with a gain between 6 6 and 9 1   In all but 6 of them  the S P 500 closed up the following day  If the VIX had closed with a greater percentage gain  there is one scenario out of several where the TTM would have predicted another down day  again  remember that predictions of up days are much more reliable with the TTM    Note well that I am STILL holding my puts on Caterpillar  CAT   It has cleanly and filled its gap up from May 3rd  It is in clear danger of reversing ALL of its post earnings recovery almost no matter what the S P 500 does If TTM nails another prediction  I strongly suspect it will happen only after a true test  and likely temporary violation  of the 50DMA support  I will then add a second tranche of SSO calls  and I will be quick to sell into any subsequent rally  Only a close above the current bear bull dividing line will convince me that the bulls are starting to regain control Yesterday also ended the 40  over period at 32 days  Over this period  the S P 500 gained 3 4   This is at the extreme of the expected range of performance While this over period turned out to be a historic outlier  the TTM still demonstrated the potential of betting on a reversion to expectations  Even the incorrect assumption of a drop to a 0  gain would have generated great gains shorting anytime in the past week  I am bookmarking this lesson for the next active over period A new primary under period has now begun  The 40  under period is biased very slightly to the upside with a wide range of potential performances until about the 15th trading day  After that  the range of possibilities greatly widens  including some large negative performances  The bias turns negative after 30 days  So  there is a way to go before an analysis of this under period becomes interesting I am not tracking an over period at this time I conclude with this view of the Japanese Nikkei index  Note well how the index printed a major reversal pattern on May 23rd which occurred the day after the S P 500 printed its own  The apparent negative feedback loop between Japan s major index and the U S  s major index seems well intact right now and must certainly be damaging bullish psychology  The ability of the Bank of Japan to print its stock market up higher has been an inspiring display of the re inflationary power of central banks and has surely provided a psychological boost here  But now  the current plunge has delivered a bright red warning flag with a 16 7  loss from the last closing high   almost a bear market Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes  Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there Disclosure  Long SSO calls  long CAT puts and shares,2013-06-06,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/quasi-oversold-conditions-accelerate-170162,170162

103641,325156,TTM,Very Extended Bull Rush,opinion,T2108 Status  73 3   11th straight overbought day VIX Status  12 5General  Short term  Trading Call  HoldCommentaryOne of the best features of this sustained overbought period is that I am not fighting it  The recent overhaul of the T2108 Trading Model  TTM  allows me to respect the potential for the continued momentum that can come from overbought periods  especially in recent years  The current bull rush is as strong as any of the others we have seen  it comes with the added bonus of setting fresh all time highs with each new high  Friday was not only the 11th straight overbought day  the 70  overperiod   but it is also the 21st straight day above the 40  threshold  the 40  overperiod 0 the first threshold crossed when the current rally began  Based on TTM  the projected performance for the S P 500  SPY  after the overperiods end is starting to improve  The projected performance for the 40  overperiod is moving up from its low point around 20 days Note well that the 40  overperiod must last for at least 50 days before the projected performance reaches 0   The S P 500 has returned 7 2  since the 40  overperiod began on April 19th with the index bouncing off its 50DMA  In other words  shorting the index here should return at least 7 2  at some point  However  the mean duration for the 40  overperiod is close to 50 days  the median is only about 10 days   A trader could be waiting quite a long time to realize this return and in the meantime experience significant upside risk  To mitigate this risk  I have established a requirement that the index must break some important support level before shorting  whereas before I was OK taking an aggressive  proactive stance with overbought periods  I have revised the bear bull dividing line to 1623 19  This line is directly below the last period of consolidation during this rally  A close below that line will trigger SSO puts with a  first  downside target to the 50DMA  You aggressive bulls that bought the breakout above 1600 are doing just fine and yes  I am getting jealous  So what about the overbought period  the 70  overperiod  The S P 500 has gained 3 3  since the overbought period began on May 3rd  This performance is already beyond the expected performance for any 70  overperiod lasting less than 25 days or so  So  again  theoretically  shorting here should eventually return positive gains  The index is also right around   In other words  making fresh bullish bets at this point carry a high risk  but there is still no trigger yet for making a good risk reward short bet  So  I continue to wait  As a reminder  I only focus on bullish bets on the S P 500 after the overbought period lasts over 25 days  In the meantime  I have no problem betting on individual stocks with proper setups  These are good bets as long as they have the tailwind of a very bullish market  Case in point for this point is Advanced Micro Devices  AMD   I missed a nice breakout on May 1st  AMD delivered the double whammy of a breakout from an extended consolidation period  This consolidation occurred after a sharp bounce from lows which retested AMD s 2009 lows  Buying volume has been very robust every since the breakout  This is a very strong chart where dips can and should be bought  Note how quickly buyers jumped on the dip from Thursday s gap down  leaving a long tail on Thursday s candlestick and solid follow through for the comeback on Friday  I am putting AMD on the active radar  I may never buy into it  but it is hard to imagine the stock market getting bearish until speculative bottom fishing in stocks like AMD comes to an end  Daily T2108 vs the S P 500Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there Full disclosure  net short euro  long CAT shares and puts  long AAPL shares  calls  and puts  long TSLA calls  PURE speculation    ANGI calls ,2013-05-19,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/very-extended-bull-rush-167537,167537

103645,325160,TTM,BioDelivery Sciences Primed To Grab Share Of The  1 5B Opioid Market ,opinion,These days  prescription drugs have become a source for legal and illegal abuse  This abuse can lead to a medical diagnosis called opioid dependence  which is when a patient becomes addicted to opioids such as morphine  hydrocodone  oxycodone  or even heroin  Recently  it has become a significant concern of the Federal Drug Administration  FDA  to take careful consideration in granting approval for drugs with a potential for abuse  Conversely  creating a better therapy for patients with pain or a treatment for drugs that can cause opioid dependence has become very important  It is the goal of several biotechnology companies to develop these therapies and capture a share of the  1 5 Billion opioid market BioDelivery Sciences International  BDSI  is a company developing several therapies for pain management and opioid dependence  The company uses its BioErodible MucoAdhesive  BEMA  technology to develop and commercialize drugs in the areas of pain management and addiction medicine  The company states   Our marketed products and those in development address serious and debilitating conditions such as breakthrough cancer pain  chronic pain  painful diabetic neuropathy and opioid dependence  BioErodible MucoAdhesive TechnologyThere are several ways to deliver a drug to a patient  each with their own advantages and disadvantages  For example  intravenous delivery is the most rapid  but also can be the most toxic because the drug is delivered throughout the entire body  BEMA technology delivers its drug across the mucous membrane  which can be more effective than oral pill form  BEMA technology is very valuable in situations where intravenous  subcutaneous  or oral forms of drug delivery are ineffective  Delivery through the mucous membrane is effective because it dissolves and enters the body quickly  but also can be less toxic  The drug dissolves across the mucosal membrane in about 15 minutes and patients testify that it is easy to use and leaves little to no aftertaste  Since patient compliance and reduced toxicity has recently become of the utmost important to the FDA  Bio Delivery Sciences International has used its BEMA technology to develop several products The company s  shows some interesting information concerning the rates of prescription painkiller sales  deaths and substance abuse treatment admissions  1999 2010    National Vital Statistics System  1999 2008  ARCOS  Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA   1999 2010  Treatment Episode Data Set  1999 2009 The website further states  Opioid dependence is a medical diagnosis that is characterized by the inability of an individual to stop using opioids  both prescription opioids such as morphine  hydrocodone and oxycodone  as well as illicit opioids such as heroin  even when it is in the best interest of the individual to do so  Opioid dependence is a complex medical condition that often requires long term treatment and care  The treatment of opioid dependence is important to reduce both the associated health and social consequences and to improve the well being and social functioning of people affected The main goals of treating persons with opioid dependence are to reduce dependence on illicit drugs  reduce morbidity and mortality  improve physical and psychological health  reduce criminal behavior  and facilitate reintegration into the workforce and education system and to improve social functioning  The ultimate achievement of a drug free state is the ideal and ultimate objective  but this may not be feasible for all individuals with opioid dependence  especially in the short term  As no single treatment is effective for all individuals with opioid dependence  diverse treatment options are needed  including psychosocial approaches and pharmacological treatment  BioDelivery Sciences International is combining its BEMA technology with a molecule called buprenorphine to create two market opportunities  Buprenorphine is currently marketed as Subxone and Subutex  with buprenorphine products used for the treatment of opioid dependence exceeding  1 5 billion in 2012  Its delivery with a low dose formulation can be used for treatment of chronic pain  while the high dose formulation with naloxone can be used for treatment of opioid pain  With only one drug on soluble film currently on the market  which is sold by Reckitt Benckiser  RB L  in the U K   there is room for a company like BioDelivery Sciences to grab market share  With the potential to capture a portion of the  1 5 million opioid dependence market and between  300  500 million of the Buprenorphine Schedule II drug market  BioDelivery Sciences International is currently under spec valued with a market cap of only  182 Million   BUNAVAILAs noted above  opioid dependence has become a significant problem in the U S  According to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Healthy  nearly 2 million people are dependent on prescription opioids  Additionally  the National Institute of Drug Abuse states that there are over 200 million opioid prescriptions dispensed per year  Each year  the amount of people using opioids for non medical needs is growing BioDelivery Sciences International is developing Bunavail as a therapy for patients with opioid depencence  The company combines buprenorphine and naloxone with its BEMA technology to develop a therapy potentially better than the current drug on the market  Suboxone So far  clinical studies have shown that Bunavail is equivalent or better than Suboxone in several ways  Bunavail has shown a lower incidence of side effects such as headache  constipation  nausea  agitation  and anxiety  Additionally  Bunavail shows better efficacy and less toxicity due to a better bioavailability and less buprenorphine needed to deliver the desired effects  In recent studies  surveyed patients have stated that BEMA technology was easy to use and had a pleasant taste  Bunavail s ease of use should lead to better patient compliance  which has also become an important factor in determining approval by the FDA Even though Bunavail contains the same drug components as Suboxone  BEMA technology makes the drug a better therapy for opioid dependence  If eventually approved by the FDA  BioDelivery Sciences International can capture a large part of Suboxone sales  which exceeded  1 5 Billion in 2012  Furthermore  this market grew greater than 20  in 2012 and there continues to be a desperate need for viable treatments   BEMA BuprenorphineBioDelivery Sciences International is also developing a low dose version of buprenorphine using BEMA technology for the treatment of chronic pain  BEMA Buprenorphine offers several advantages over current treatments  It is classified as a Class III opioid  meaning that patients are less likely to become addicted  while offering pain relief similar to a Class II opioid like morphine  Additionally  BEMA Buprenorphine has the potential for fewer side effects such as respiratory depression  constipation  and cognitive function  Since patients with chronic pain have to use these treatments daily for a long period of time  it is important that side effects be kept to a minimum BioDelivery Sciences International partnered with Endo Pharmaceuticals  ENDP  in January 2012 for BEMA Buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain  Currently in Phase III clinical trials  the company is eligible receive up to  180 Million in milestone payments  with  30 Million to be received for completion of the trial  The company will also receive an additional  50 Million for FDA approval and even more in potential sale milestones  The estimated market potential for its BEMA technology is  300 million according to Dr  Mark Sirgo  CEO of BioDelivery Sciences  There is considerable political pressure mounting for these types of drugs to be more readily available on the market  since there are a plethora of addictive pain drugs on the market being abused   OnsolisOnsolis is an FDA approved drug that also utilizes the BEMA drug delivery technology  which consists of a small  bioerodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa  inner lining of the cheek   Onsolis is an opioid analgesic indicated only for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer  18 years of age and older  who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain Near Term CatalystBioDelivery Sciences International is expecting to submit a New Drug Application for BUNAVAIL in mid summer 2013  In its   the company states   Additionally  we completed a  40 million registered financing which will assist in funding the clinical trial programs for both BEMA Buprenorphine and BUNAVAIL  while also providing a strong balance sheet as we continue BUNAVAIL licensing discussions in the U S  and abroad and consider commercializing BUNAVAIL ourselves  We look forward to an exciting 2013 and working to achieve a number of key milestones  including the anticipated mid year filing of our NDA for BUNAVAIL and moving the Phase 3 studies for BEMA Buprenorphine for chronic pain toward completion  We will also be determining whether to move forward with commercializing BUNAVAIL on our own or through a commercial partnership here in the U S  Continued progress was made in the development of BioDelivery s two buprenorphine containing products with the completion in January 2013 of the safety study for BUNAVAIL for the treatment of opioid dependence  The study  which included 249 patients who were switched from Suboxone to BUNAVAIL  demonstrated the ease of use and tolerability of BUNAVAIL    Future Catalysts BioDelivery Sciences International has several upcoming milestones in 2013 that can drive shareholder value  The company is focusing its resources on  BUNAVAIL commercialization opportunities  BDSI will continue to evaluate its strategic options for the commercialization of BUNAVAIL  which include partnership  internal approaches or a combination of these  BDSI expects to finalize its strategy in the second half of 2013 Recruitment of two Phase 3 studies for BEMA Buprenorphine  BDSI and Endo expect to continue recruitment in the two Phase 3 efficacy studies for BEMA Buprenorphine for chronic pain  one in opioid experienced and one in opioid na ve patient groups  The trials are expected to complete in late 2013 or early 2014  Upon completion of study enrollment and database lock for each trial  and the acceptance of filing of the NDA with the FDA  BDSI is expected to receive milestone payments from Endo totaling  30 million Commence Confirmatory Study for Clonidine Topical Gel  BDSI plans to prepare for a confirmatory study in the latter part of 2013 which could lead to data availability by the end of 2014 Re introduction of ONSOLIS in the U S  In March 2013  BDSI and its commercial partner Meda submitted a proposal to FDA to reintroduce ONSOLIS for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain into the U S  marketplace following previously reported appearance issues with the product  If approved by FDA  the original ONSOLIS formulation may be on the market during the second half of 2013 while stability data is collected on a newly formulated version of ONSOLIS  These data may be submitted to FDA before the end of the year  and if approved  could allow introduction of the new formulation sometime in 2014 Exploration of potential new products and technologies  In addition to advancing its lead products in development  BDSI is also  as in the past  exploring the application of its BEMA drug delivery technology to additional pharmaceuticals  In addition  BDSI continues to investigate potential new products and technologies to complement and diversify its existing portfolio Strong Management As mentioned  this appears to be the right time politically for these kinds of drugs to be developed and marketed  In my opinion  the right companies with good products  and more importantly  good management stand to benefit the most  I found this interesting  with Dr  Mark Sirgo who explains what BDSI is currently engaged in  In the video  Dr  Sirgo gives his opinion stating the  300M potential of BEMA  Some other highlights from the video include the following quotes from Sirgo   The two products in our pipeline have much greater value than our first product  explains Dr  Sirgo  We ve demonstrated the ability to move products through the regulatory hurdles  Investors need to take a closer look at our pipeline and the value that we plan to create there  We have one marketed product that uses the same technology that products in our pipeline are using  It s approved  It s been through the FDA and it serves as a great proof of concept for our ability to not only take our product through the regulatory pathway  but also partner and get through commercialization  BEMA Buprenorphine is a unique opioide  it s a class three  It s the only standalone class three  The classifications are by the DEA  Drug Enforcement Administration   the higher the number  the less abuse and addiction potential of the opioid  So  class two s for instance are fentanyl  morphine  and oxycodone  BEMA Buprenorphine doesn t lose any of the efficacies of the C2 narcotics  but it has a much better safety profile   Dr  Mark Sirgo is a very good CEO  one of the best there is for among small cap biotech companies  He has consistently avoided turning to capital markets for financing  instead choosing to partner various products along with registered offerings to support the company s proprietary pipeline  For those of you who listen to my  and follow me on twitter  I constantly reiterate how important it is for a company to have good management  One of my favorite sayings is   always bet on the jockey  not so much the horse   A company can have great product potential  yet if its management is not good  problems can arise  A good example of what can happen to a company with a potentially good product  but poor management is Amarin  AMRN   In July of last year  Amarin s Pharmaceutical grade fish oil Vascepa received  for marketing  However  the company was not prepared in advance to market and manufacture the drug  although it had ample time to secure partnerships in order to monetize the asset  Additionally  the CEO was constantly talking to the market about Amarin  being for sale   These actions in my mind constitute poor management  Good management would have secured partnerships long in advance of FDA approval  and basically kept their lips sealed  if looking to sell the company  At the time of FDA approval for Vascepa  the stock was selling for over  15 a share  Currently  it is selling for  6 78  representing roughly a 60  drop in the stock  This could have been avoided if the company s management was properly prepared  Vascepa is a good asset  and the company has  to secure the proper manufacturing for the drug  but it might be far too late in game to effectively have an impact to justify a stock price back over  10  at least at this time  In contrast  an example of good management can be found with Keryx Biopharmaceuticals  KERX   On January 28th of this year  the company  positive Phase III data for Zerenex   ferric citrate   the Company s ferric iron based phosphate binder drug candidate  for the treatment of elevated serum phosphorus levels  or hyperphosphatemia  in patients with end stage renal disease  ESRD  on dialysis  Management somewhat  sandbagged  on the data  delaying its public release  This caused many biotech traders to buy puts and take up short positions in the stock  At one point  30  of the trading float was held short  Upon revealing the positive news on Zerenex  the stock skyrocketed to over  9 a share from  6 06  causing a massive short squeeze  During this squeeze  the company then  a  55 million underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock price at around  9 50  With this offering  the forced buy in shorts had the shares needed to cover    at a devastation loss  Delaying the release of Zerenex data served to trap in shorts  allowing them to think the company  because the data reported was delayed  would announce poor data  To me  this is the type of management I look for in a small cap developmental biotech  BioDelivery s Dr  Sirgo is definitely one of my favorite small cap biotech CEO s  more than capable of leading the company into a successful future   What really sticks out to me from the above chart is Baker Brothers Advisors  LLC onboard here with BioDelivery  Bakers Brothers have had rather epic success over the past 2 years investing in smaller cap biotechs  Acadia Pharma  ACAD  has been a great investment so far for Baker Brothers  Baker invested in Acadia when stock price was stuck around  2 a share for what seemed like an eternity  until the company announced both  for its lead drug pimavanserin  indicated for the treatment of Parkinson s disease psychosis  PDP   and allowance of an  NDA filing from the FDA  Now  Baker is sitting on over a 600  gain since they originally were vested  Baker Brothers also has a substantial position in Insmed  INSM  which I wrote about recently when the stock was  8 80  setting  11 a share as my catalyst trade price target  Less than a week later  the stock hit over  12  as new institutions and bigger money investors took notice of the company and its potentially very valuable pipeline  I am hearing some buzz that additional institutions are taking a hard look at BioDelivery here  so I expect to see buying on the increase in the coming weeks  Financial PositionCash Flow Statement Operating Cash Flow  TTM    23 84M The company burns about  6M a quarter and has roughly  50M in cash  more than enough for 9 quarters  With milestone and royalty payments due upon upcoming approvals  the company should be in a position to greatly reduce  if not eliminate its cash burn all together  Chart Technicals   The above chart is very bullish  showing the recent price correction is done  and accumulation is underway  The last wave started at near  4 a share and ran almost to  6  I expect the new wave to move to a pivot price of  5 25 or so  Where it goes from that point will remain to be seen  Conclusion  The company s current market cap of  169 84M is just way to low in my strong opinion  as BioDelivery Sciences is poised to take a substantial share of the multi Billion dollar pain management and opioid dependence market  Its BEMA platform allows for its drugs to have lessened side effects  better patient compliance  and less of a propensity for patients to develop dependence through long time use  The FDA has been in favor of approving drugs that reduce the chance of abusing prescription medicine  These factors  along with BioDelivery Sciences  strong management team  puts the company in a prime position to capitalize on this opportunity  Based on the chart and the company s near term NDA filing  My short term price target opinion is  5 25  My long term 1 year price target is  9  if management executes and progresses on its goals by the middle of 2014

103673,325188,TTM,Overbought  Month Of May Versus T2108 Technicals,opinion,T2108 Status  71 6  VIX Status  12 9 General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold  see below for more details Commentary T2108 managed to hit overbought before the week ended after all  The S P 500 surged to a new all time high with a 1 1  gain in the wake of what the market seemed to interpret as a good employment report  However  I feel that momentum is so strong now that even a weak number could not have stopped the current technical strength  and mainstream media headlines would have attributed the strength to the market s anticipation of more accommodation from the Fed due to weak employment numbers  I was hoping to have a complete review of what the overhauled T2108 Model has to say about this overbought period  but I will have to save the details for another day  In the meantime  I highly recommend you read my thoughts for this month   This Month Of May Is Not Likely To Hurt   Just In Case  Some Hedging Ideas   In this piece  I update a surprising view I developed from two years ago revealing that May and the subsequent summer is only bad when it is REALLY bad  This time around  the odds favor a May that does NOT ring the selling bell With that backdrop  I remain uninterested in trying to fade the market here without additional technical confirmation  Setting a floor under which I would trigger a short  it was 1580 on the S P 500   helped to avoid getting caught leaning the wrong way on the rally over the past two days  I now bump that floor up to Friday s low   that technical level just sings out to me as a fine dividing line for short term bear versus bull trades  This level neatly coincides with the previous all time high and was tight resistance until Friday s rally This is the 11th day of the T2108 40  overperiod and of course the first day of the 70  overperiod  According to the new T2108 Trading Model  TTM   the market is reaching toward its maximum downside risk levels over the next 10 or so trading days  two calendar weeks   The S P 500 price prediction for the 40  overperiod is heavily biased negatively if T2108 drops below 40   This part should be obvious given how high the S P 500 has climbed now  Combine this risk with a median duration of about 4 days and average duration of about 7 or 8 days for the 70  overperiod  and we get one explosive combination  Thus  I definitely want to load up the truck on SSO puts with the S P 500 CLOSING below 1597  If no decline occurs  then the S P 500 will likely experience another extended overbought period  In fact  it makes sense for the most bullish amongst you to open up such trades here with a tight stop below 1597  I will be looking for buy on dip opportunities in individual stocks as long as the S P 500 stays above 1597 Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there ,2013-05-06,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/overbought:-month-of-may-versus-t2108-technicals-165739,165739
103674,325189,TTM,Stock Market Ignores Currency Turmoil,opinion,T2108 Status  74 0   6th overbought day VIX Status  12 6General  Short term  Trading Call  HoldCommentary The S P 500  SPY  closed at its high of the day and a new all time high by one point  This happened despite continued turmoil in the currency market  The dollar index soared again as it scored a fresh 4 year high against the Japanese yen  pushed the Australian dollar below parity for a while  took the Canadian dollar to 50DMA resistance before falling back  pushed the euro below its 50DMA support  and took the pound to its 50DMA support  Almost none of these paths were straightforward as traders bought and sold  panicked and rushed  in fits and starts  I think these past two days are the beginning tremors of what should be a tumultuous expiration week next week as bears get more and more impatient for the month of May to deliver the selling that they anticipated  Caterpillar  CAT  is part of my watchlist for  sell in May   As I mentioned in the previous update  CAT triggered a sell  bought put options   Sure enough  CAT sold off today despite the good tidings on the S P 500  CAT dropped 1 5  and just barely held support at its 200DMA  I consider CAT s drop the expected response to a stronger dollar given the company s global footprint and reliance on commodities  With put options in hand  I will have a laser focus now on CAT s day to day trading and any correlations to the broader market Finally  T2108 dropped two days in a row allowing me to run a forecast for Monday using the T2108 Trading Model  TTM   T2108 only declined 5 2  over these past two days  but it caught my interest since Friday s drop created a very mild bearish divergence with the S P 500  If you have been following the development of TTM  you know that these forecasts generally get more accurate for steeper 2 day drops  So  as expected  TTM could not generate a high probability forecast for Monday s trading  46  chance of a down day  54  chance of an up day  So  we have a stalemate  and I will not initiate any SSO calls at Monday s open Regardless  next week should be a critical one  As a reminder  if T2108 finishes the week overbought without interruption  I will essentially project an extended stay in overbought territory  This will turn me bullish  buy on the dips   For you aggressive bulls  you are still doing OK with any buys on the breakout using a tight stop below 1597 on the S P 500 Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there Full disclosure  long CAT shares and puts  net short Australian dollar  yen and euro  net long U S  dollar and British pound  short Canadian dollar,2013-05-12,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-market-ignores-currency-turmoil-166482,166482

103677,325192,TTM,20 Best Yielding Stocks From The Share Buyback Achievers Index ,opinion,I love dividends and dividend growth but that s not the only way to see income from your investments  Unfortunately  most investors are fixed on the dividend theme  A lot of companies know this and they try to catch investors by paying dividends only  and letting the investors hope the dividends will grow over time  The problem is the companies have only a middling business model  or worse  and they burn shareholder value by following the dividend growth approach   A better way to give money back to shareholders is via a share buyback program  Through this program  the company buys its own stock and reduces the amount of outstanding shares  As a result  earnings per share grow at a higher rate and the share price generally follows because the P E goes down and thus yields go up  There exists an index that covers the best stocks with share buy backs of at least 5 percent or more for the trailing 12 months  This index is called the Buyback Achievers Index  Over 200 companies are constituents but only half of them pay dividends   Today  I d like to introduce the 20 highest yielding

103710,325225,TTM,Is The Stock Market Cheap ,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1 570 70  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1 597 57  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet TTM P E ratio   17 5  17 8 P E10 ratio   22 5  22 9 The Valuation Thesis A standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias TTM P E RatioThe  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the    See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file   The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits    as high as the 120s    in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500 Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation The P E10 RatioLegendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book  Security Analysis  They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested 5  7 or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of Irrational Exuberance  has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation The Correlation Between The S P Composite And Its P E10As the chart below illustrates  the P E10 closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  In fact  the correlation between the two since 1881  the year when the first decade of average earnings is available  is 0 77   Note  A perfect positive correlation would be 1 and the absence of correlation would be 0  The historic P E10 average is 16 5  After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the ratio rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of 2011 year and is now at 22 5  The ratio in the chart above is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices for the index   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10  Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits Where does the current valuation put us  For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles    five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  and it has since hovered around that boundary  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 37  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 48 to two decimal places   Last month it was 36  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is about 20  above trend  Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 87th percentile of the 1588 data points in this series  A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 550  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now in its thirteenth year Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  and certainly the new nominal all time high set at the end of March is a conspicuous tick mark for the optimists  But the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to access the Standard   Poor s earnings spreadsheet Click the S P 500 link in the second column of the  Click the

103711,325226,TTM,Why Is JSW Steel Expansion In A Holding Pattern  Part 2,opinion,West Bengal State Industry Minister Partha Chatterjee was obviously trying to save face following the kibosh on the new JSW plant  especially since his state had lost a very prestigious multimillion dollar car project by Tata Motors to another state because of local politics just a few years ago   Now  to lose yet another potentially employment generating project would mean a double body blow to his government   hence the last minute face saving attempts   Nobody  however  Jindal and the minister included  was willing to offer any timeline for the project  The JSW West Bengal project was first announced in 2007  It was delayed at various times for various reasons  including a land acquisition row  which was later resolved   Now  the iron ore issue has stalled it yet again  So what are JSW s conditions moving forward   Reports say JSW wants a captive iron ore mine  preferably somewhere in the vicinity of the proposed plant  before getting on with the project  It has a similar 10 million ton steel plant in Karnataka  but there  too  it was forced to source ore from the open market  affecting its revenue  For over 18 months now  JSW has been running the Karnataka plant at a reduced capacity due to iron ore crunch   In fact  JSW Steel had earlier put on hold expansion plans of this Vijayanagar plant  to take it from 10 million tons to 12 million tons of capacity  due to the ore shortage  The lifting of the iron ore mining ban by the Supreme Court of India is expected to benefit JSW the most in Karnataka  where it is the largest steelmaker  Experts now expect JSW to go ahead with its plant expansion in Karnataka   According to the original plan  JSW s West Bengal project was to have a 10 million ton steel plant along with a 1 600 MW captive power plant spread over 4 300 acres of land  In the first phase  the company had plans to set up a 3 million ton steel plant and a 300 MW captive power plant by Sohrab Darabshaw,2013-05-02,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-jsw-steel-expansion-in-a-holding-pattern-part-2-165330,165330

103722,325237,TTM,13 Dividend Champions With Very Low Debt To Equity Ratios ,opinion,I believe that I don t need a bigger return when I invest in historically safe stocks  In this way I try to avoid the real big risks of investing  Every cent I don t lose with my current holdings is also a cent that I don t need to earn back with other stocks  That s my philosophy   A real problem that affects a stock s price is the company s debt situation  While most people only talk about growth and future potential  I look at these ratios as well as the company s abilities to repay any outstanding debt  Remember  as a shareholder  you get your dividends after loan and interest repayments   Debt overloaded stocks sometimes need decades to reduce their debt if they operate in a non growth industry  Therefore  stocks with a bigger cash holding are  in my view  the better alternative  These companies have more growth possibilities and if they don t find ways to invest their money  they can repurchase their own shares or boost their current dividend   Today  I m focussing on some of the best dividend growth stocks with a very long dividend growth history and a very low leverage risk  I

103744,325259,TTM,High Yield Oil And Gas Pipeline Stocks ,opinion,Stocks from the basic material sector could complement your portfolio and hedge it against strong commodity price increases  One industry from the basic material sector with the highest yielding stocks is the oil and gas pipeline industry   39 companies are linked to the industry of which 37 pay dividends  Combined they have a total market capitalization of USD 800 billion  Nearly 60 percent of the industry players have a yield over 5 percent and some have a really great dividend history  Thanks to the share gas boom it s now possible that more pipeline infrastructure is needed  The average industry yield amounts to 4 72  and the P E ratio is 33 40   You should have seen some interesting pipeline companies on my blog in the past  Normally I am no fan of real estate companies because of the huge amounts of money they need for growing  But pipeline operators look different  They pay huge dividends and have the ability to grow dividends year over year  Their business model works but I don t know how long  Pipeline operators are better than real estate stocks but it could be possible that the time brings some changes  especially when the energy demand and supply is changing   Oil and gas pipeline stocks are real asset companies and they have a huge leverage on their balance sheet  The average industry long

103751,325266,TTM,Is Today s Market Cheap  An Update,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1 550 83  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1 569 19  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet TTM P E ratio   17 5  17 7 P E10 ratio   22 5  22 7 The Valuation ThesisA standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias TTM P E RatioThe  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the    See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file  The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits    as high as the 120s    in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500 Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation The P E10 RatioLegendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book  Security Analysis  They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested 5  7 or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of Irrational Exuberance  has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation The Correlation Between The S P Composite And Its P E10As the chart below illustrates  the P E10 closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  In fact  the correlation between the two since 1881  the year when the first decade of average earnings is available  is 0 77   Note  A perfect positive correlation would be 1 and the absence of correlation would be 0  The historic P E10 average is 16 5  After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the ratio rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of 2011 year and is now at 22 5  The ratio in the chart above is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices for the index   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10  Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits Where Does The Current Valuation Put Us For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles    five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  and it has since hovered around that boundary  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 36  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 47 to two decimal places   Last month it was 34  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is about 20  above trend  up from 17  last month  19 6  versus 17 4  at one decimal place   Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 87th percentile of the 1587 data points in this series  A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 550  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now approaching its 13th anniversary Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  and certainly the new nominal all time high set at the end of March is a conspicuous tick mark for the optimists  But the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to access the Standard   Poor s

103785,325300,TTM,Dividend Paying Grocery Stocks,opinion,A very interesting investment field is to buy chains  Every company has a chain but I don t talk about the relationship structures of a company when they buy commodities  manufacture products and sell them in the end to customers  I talk about store systems like McDonalds or Wal Mart  For sure  these are two very successful chains with strong brands and lot s of value  Normally a smaller chain has no big values  To buy a store system is a way to make fast money because a profitable concept can be copied all over the world in a very short time  All you need is the right location to expand your selling space  Think about Starbucks and how they work  The critical point is if your business concept will be accepted by different cultures and if your customers are loyal to your products when competition rises  All will be measured in the ratio  Same Store Sales   That s a figure which counts the percentage sales increase of older

103856,325371,TTM,13 Low Volatility  Under Valued  High Yield Stocks ,opinion,I often look for higher capitalized stocks which give me a margin of safety  I don t talk about a discount to the fair value or cheap prices  I mean a low volatility stocks  Stocks with a low beta ratio have a lower volatility than the whole market but they also have a lower upside potential if the market goes up    If the low beta stocks also have a low valuation  it could be interesting  You can find a full list of higher capitalized high yield stocks with low beta ratios below  In total  there are 13 companies with a market capitalization over USD 2 billion and a yield above the 5 percent mark that have beta ratios of less than 0 5 and a forward P E of less than 15   The results are dominated by residential REITS  I personally don t like this investment category  Sure  you can make money with it but growth is very capital intensive  You sit on your investment and wait for rental price increases or decreasing vacancy rates  That s not very fun for a long term growth investor like me  As you see  there is also a huge debt burden on the stocks which exceeds the amount of equity by a few factors  Gas utilities and my favorites from the cigarette industry are much more interesting   Five of the results have a very high yield  of more than 10 percent  Seven have a current buy or better

103896,325411,TTM,Is The Stock Market Cheap ,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1 422 29  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1 426 19  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet TTM P E ratio   16 3  16 4 P E10 ratio   21 3  21 3 The Valuation ThesisA standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias TTM P E RatioThe  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the    See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file  The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits    as high as the 120s    in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500 Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation The P E10 RatioLegendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book  Security Analysis  They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested five  seven or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of Irrational Exuberance  has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  As the accompanying chart illustrates  this ratio closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  The historic average is 16 4  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation The Current P E10After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the P E10 rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of 2011 year and is now at 21 3  The next chart gives us a historical context for these numbers  The ratio in this chart is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10  Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits  Where Does The Current Valuation Put Us For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles    five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  and it has since hovered around that boundary  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 29  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 46 to two decimal places   Last month it was 27  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is about 14  above trend  up from 12  last month  13 8  versus 11 7  at one decimal place   Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 82nd percentile of the 1583 data points in this series  A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 540  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now in its 12th year Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  but the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to access the Standard   Poor s earnings spreadsheet Click the S P 500 link in the second column of the Standard   Poor s Click the plus symbol to the

consecutive years and have all been highly rated by the credit rating agency Standard   Poor s These are my criteria   Forward P E under 15  Past 5Y Sales growth over 5 percent  Earnings per share growth for the next five years over 5 percent  Operating Margin over 5 percentFourteen Dividend Aristocrats fulfilled these criteria of which three yielding above three percent  Nine are currently

103962,325477,TTM,Is The Stock Market Cheap ,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1394 52  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1 416 18  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet   TTM P E ratio   16 0  16 2    P E10 ratio   20 8  21 1  The Valuation Thesis  A standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias  TTM P E Ratio The  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the    See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file    The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers   The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits   as high as the 120s   in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out  As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500 Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation  The P E10 Ratio Legendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book    They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested 5  7 or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of   has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  As the accompanying chart illustrates  this ratio closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  The historic average is 16 4  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation  The Current P E10 After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the P E10 rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of last year and is now at 20 8  The next chart gives us a historical context for these numbers  The ratio in this chart is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10   Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits Where does the current valuation put us For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles   five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  and it has since hovered around that boundary  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 26  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 46 to two decimal places   Last month it was 31  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is about 11  above trend  down from 15  last month  11 2  versus 15 3  at one decimal place   Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 80th percentile of the 1582 data points in this series A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 540  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now in its 12th year Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  but the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to

104026,325541,TTM,Is The Stock Market Cheap ,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1 437 82  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1 412 16  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet TTM P E ratio   16 2  15 9 P E10 ratio   21 6  21 2 The Valuation ThesisA standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias TTM P E RatioThe  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the    See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file   The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits    as high as the 120s    in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out  As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500 Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation The P E10 RatioLegendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book  Security Analysis  They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested five  seven or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of Irrational Exuberance  has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  As the accompanying chart illustrates  this ratio closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  The historic average is 16 4  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation The Current P E10After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the P E10 rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of last year and is now at 21 6  The next chart gives us a historical context for these numbers  The ratio in this chart is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10  Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits Where Does The Current Valuation Put Us For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles    five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  and it has since hovered around that boundary  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 31  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 46 to two decimal places   Last month it was 33  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is about 15  above trend  down from 17  last month  15 4  versus 16 5  at one decimal place   Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 83rd percentile of the 1582 data points in this series  A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 540  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now in its 12th year Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  but the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to access the Standard   Poor s earnings spreadsheet Click the S P 500 link in the second column of the  Click the plus symbol to the left of the

104052,325567,TTM,Is The Stock Market Cheap ,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1 443 42  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1 440 67  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet   TTM P E ratio   16 3  16 3    P E10 ratio   21 9  21 8  The Valuation Thesis  A standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias  TTM P E Ratio The  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the    See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file   The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits   as high as the 120s   in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500 Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation  The P E10 Ratio  Legendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book    They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested 5  7 or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of   has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  As the accompanying chart illustrates  this ratio closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  The historic average is 16 4  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation  The Current P E10After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the P E10 rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of last year and is now at 21 5  The next chart gives us a historical context for these numbers  The ratio in this chart is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10  Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits Where does the current valuation put us For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles   five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  and it has since hovered around that boundary  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 33  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 45 to two decimal places   Last month it was 30  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is about 17  above trend  up from 15  last month  Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 84th percentile of the 1581 data points in this series  A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 540  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now in its 12th year Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  but the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to access the Standard   Poor s earnings spreadsheet

104067,325582,TTM,Is The Stock Market Cheap ,opinion,Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard   Poor s  as reported  earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month  which is 1 403 45  The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1 406 58  For the earnings  see the table below created from Standard   Poor s latest earnings spreadsheet   TTM P E ratio   15 9  15 9    P E10 ratio   21 5  21 6  The Valuation Thesis  A standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price to Earnings  P E  ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months  TTM   Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking  erroneous assumptions  and analyst bias  TTM P E Ratio The  price  part of the P E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet  The  earnings  part  however  is more difficult to find  The authoritative source is the Standard   Poor s website  where the latest numbers are posted on the    See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file    The table here shows the TTM earnings based on  as reported  earnings and a combination of  as reported  earnings and Standard   Poor s estimates for  as reported  earnings for the next few quarters  The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers   The average P E ratio since the 1870 s has been about 15  But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P E ratio was in triple digits   as high as the 120s   in the Spring of 2009  In 1999  a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble  the conventional P E ratio hit 34  It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out   As these examples illustrate  in times of critical importance  the conventional P E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator   Why the lag   you may wonder   How can the P E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far   The explanation is simple  Earnings fell faster than price  In fact  the negative earnings of 2008 Q4    23 25  is something that has never happened before in the history of the S P 500   Let s look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P E as a consistent indicator of market valuation  The P E10 Ratio Legendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash  Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market s value  which they discussed in their 1934 classic book    They attributed the illogical P E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle  Their solution was to divide the price by a multi year average of earnings and suggested 5  7 or 10 years  In recent years  Yale professor Robert Shiller  the author of   has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10 year average of  real   inflation adjusted  earnings as the denominator  As the accompanying chart illustrates  this ratio closely tracks the real  inflation adjusted  price of the S P Composite  The historic average is 16 4  Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio  abbreviated as CAPE  or the more precise P E10  which is my preferred abbreviation  The Current P E10 After dropping to 13 3 in March 2009  the P E10 rebounded to an interim high of 23 5 in February of last year and is now at 21 5  The next chart gives us a historical context for these numbers  The ratio in this chart is doubly smoothed  10 year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices   Thus the fluctuations during the month aren t especially relevant  e g   the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P E10   Of course  the historic P E10 has never flat lined on the average  On the contrary  over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over  and under valued ranges  If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P E10  we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all time high above 44 in December 1999  The 1929 high of 32 6 comes in at a distant second  The secular bottoms in 1921  1932  1942 and 1982 saw P E10 ratios in the single digits Where does the current valuation put us For a more precise view of how today s P E10 relates to the past  our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles   five groups  each with 20  of the total  Ratios in the top 20  suggest a highly overvalued market  the bottom 20  a highly undervalued market  What can we learn from this analysis  The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory  with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009  The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile  and it has since hovered around that boundary  By this historic measure  the market is expensive  with the ratio approximately 31  above its average  arithmetic mean  of 16 5  16 45 to two decimal places   Last month it was 28  above I ve also included a regression trendline through the P E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve  The latest ratio is about 15  above trend  up from 12  last month  Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this  unnatural  slope to the regression We can also use a percentile analysis to put today s market valuation in the historical context  As the chart below illustrates  latest P E10 ratio is approximately at the 83rd percentile of the 1580 data points in this series  A more cautionary observation is that when the P E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile  it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits  Based on the latest 10 year earnings average  to reach a P E10 in the high single digits would require an S P 500 price decline below 540  Of course  a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge  If the 2009 trough was not a P E10 bottom  when might we see it occur  These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three  The current decline is now in its 12th year Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market  Perhaps  but the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective Note  Follow these steps to access the Standard   Poor s earnings spreadsheet

boost its economy and there s evidence of a growing Chinese bubble  Russia requires you to put your faith in a corrupt oligarchy  Sooner or later  China and Russia are more likely to suffer from these excesses than their BRIC colleagues  Brazil and India    You can trade in international or emerging market stocks through the use of ADRs  American Depositary Receipts   ADRs prices are in U S  dollars  pay dividends in U S  dollars and can be traded like the shares of U S  based companies  India is Asia s 3rd largest economy and has maintained strong economic growth through the global

global financial meltdown  but India remains one of the fastest growing economies in Asia  Just compare this with estimates of 2010 U S  GDP growth of only 1 5   The best way to capitalize on growth in India is by investing in Indian banks  Although its economy doesn t grow as fast as China s  the banking system operates independently of the government so the loans are higher quality and there s no forced lending    India ADR picks  Tata Motors  NYSE  TTM   India s biggest car manufacturer  maker of the Tata Nano  the cheapest car in the world  Has been one of our top investments the past six

further on one of Tencent s biggest holdings       What use to be my personal BRIC favorite is Brazil  the world s 8th largest economy has been slowly falling due to what I call too much government intervention  As the U S  sinks deeper into public sector debt and federal bureaucracy  Brazil has had huge success in reducing public debt and the level of bureaucratic control  Brazil restructured its finances years ago and is now in far better shape in terms of debt than the U S   Japan and most of Europe  Brazil also has huge oil reserves and a fast growing domestic market   which means it s

104118,325633,TTM,The Disaster At Maruti ,opinion,The news from   MARUTI NS  is   I have been curiously watching  That Maruti has serious labour problems has been known for a long time  But the brutality that unfolded in recent days was out of the world  It was news  When I read about it on Thursday  it seemed to me that Maruti was facing a Tata Motors  TATAMOTOR NS  style situation  of suffering the fixed cost of closing down the existing plant and relocating to a state with better governance  The costs faced in this would be substantial  In that case  a 6 per cent decline of the stock price seemed pretty modest  I watched the small recovery on Friday with surprise  Surely  the cost and complexity of moving out of Manesar is worse than 5   Yesterday  on Monday  the market has shifted from a less sanguine assessment to a 10  drop in the stock price  I wonder if this is new information or a modified judgment about how this will play out  Were the speculators on late Friday evening just wrong  or did some new information break  Bad macroeconomic outcomes and social stress  I would conjecture that poor macroeconomic performance    low GDP growth and high inflation    is correlated with greater stress of this nature  With inflation  the logic is straightforward  The worker who had a nominal wage contract finds the need to renegotiate when the value of the rupee changes  This links back to the earlier discussion here on   Too often  we in India are cavalier about inflation  But we should see inflation as an acid that corrodes all nominal contracts  whether stated or unstated  Renegotiation is costly  Turning to GDP growth  most people that I know seem to think that a couple of per cent of real per capita GDP growth is important for keeping the peace  A lot of people become a lot more unhappy when growth slows  Indian democracy does a pretty good job of containing the angst  There will be no revolution here  But life is substantially easier if the engine of GDP growth is purring  When it stalls    as it appears to have done in 2012    a whole host of social problems erupt  Law and order as the fundamental foundation of civilisation  This is a reminder to us about how law and order is the fundamental precondition of civilisation  The most important public good of all  the first claim on the resources of the State including the time and attention of the senior leadership  is police  courts and laws  The entire story of the market economy and high GDP growth can only come about when safety of life and property is guaranteed  The events in Maruti are an important reminder to every investor about the weaknesses of governance in Haryana  In tracking conditions in any state  I find it useful to watch the time series of the share of the state in the overall all India investments outstanding  that are  under implementation   in   Here s an example  for Bihar  November 2005 is the date that Nitish Kumar became the new CM of Bihar  He is widely reputed to have made important progress on improving law and order  At first  the share of Bihar  in all India under implementation investment  continued to drop  I am sure the changes brought about by Nitish took time  Rome wasn t built in a day  And  after improvements come about  skeptical investors would take some time in making up their minds that conditions are now better  From 2009 onwards  it appears that there is some upward movement  The overall gain seems to be roughly 1 per cent of the all India total  which is a significant change Compare this with Haryana There was a big spurt in the share of Haryana in the overall under implementation investment in India  After that  the numbers have steadily trended down  Is Haryana suffering from   Rethinking labour law  In the early decades about independence  India constructed a remarkable legal framework which was strongly pro trade union  Few countries have enshrined trade unions into laws on the scale that India has done  In those years  trade unions were primarily led by socialist communist parties  While we may disagree with their views  there was a fundamental decency about them  Some of the best human beings in India  in the 1950s and 1960s  were communist  Perhaps this coloured our thinking  and encouraged us to respect and empower trade unions strongly in the legal framework which fell into place over the 1960s and   Today  a hyper empowered trade union is a potent tool for extortion in the hands of local goons  To solve this problem  it is important to rethink the checks and balances embedded in labour law  which have gone too far in the direction of making trade unions strong  Now that we know that the people in trade unions are most likely local goons  do we want to hyper empower them through labour law ,2012-07-24,Ajay Shah,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-disaster-at-maruti-130612,130612
104152,325667,TTM,Forget Ford And GM  This Is The Best Auto Stock To Own,opinion,Although things are clearly looking up big name domestic car companies such as  Ford Motor Co   NYSE  F  and General Motors  NYSE  GM   investors seeking an auto stock with eye popping growth potential may want to look far away  Very far away  in fact    like about 8 000 miles  You d have to go that far to visit Mumbai  where one of my favorite car companies is headquartered  The company s stock is up more than 60  in 2012  compared with gains of about 10  for GM and 1  for Ford  What s more  the stock has delivered 54  annual returns for the past three years  And even though it has so wildly outperformed  I think it could still more than double in the next few years    The stock I m talking about is Tata Motors Ltd   NYSE  TTM   If you re not all that familiar it  I strongly suggest taking a closer look  Tata has actually been around a long time  since 1945  though you may not have heard of it until fairly recently  Shares have only been available on the New York Stock Exchange since 2004  as American Depository Receipts  or ADRs   Today  Tata is India s largest motor vehicle maker  with total revenue of  32 5 billion in 2011  It s the world s fifth largest medium and heavy commercial truck manufacturer and the world s second largest medium and heavy bus manufacturer  Besides India  it has operations in the United Kingdom  Spain  South Korea  South Africa and Thailand    Most of the company s press has been related to its no frills compact car  the Nano  which has come to be known as  The People s Car  of India since its early 2007 introduction  At the time  it sold for the equivalent of just  2 500 U S  dollars and now still only costs around  4 200  Despite the Nano s overall success  though  sales have only been in the range of 8 000 9 200 units per month  noticeably below the 10 000 a month goal initially set by management and well below the 20 000 a month it hoped to be selling by now  The main problem is the Nano s reputation  which was hurt early on by problems like a potentially unreliable starter and electrical and exhaust system flaws that increased the risk of fire  a couple cases of this were reported     However  management has been addressing these issues through recalls  retrofits and design improvements in newer models  So I think monthly sales could soon begin to regularly top 10 000 and gradually approach the 20 000 goal as problem solving efforts improve the Nano s reputation  Sales should also spike when Tata enters North America  Indeed  a  Nano America  could be available sometime in 2012 or 2013 for  7 000  8 000    Besides the Nano  Tata has a strong line up of passenger vehicles  such as the Manza and Indigo sedans  the Xenon pickup  the Sumo Victa and Safari utility vehicles and the Vista hatchback  It s also developing an electric version of the Nano  and in March  unveiled the Megapixel  a four seat extended range electric concept car    The purchase of Jaguar Land Rover  JLR  in March 2008 for  2 3 billion was an excellent move  since it instantly gave Tata two internationally recognized marquee brands and immediate entry into the global luxury vehicle market  The JLR division currently accounts for 57  of revenue and about 65  of operating earnings  with the rest coming from the original India based operations    Because India s passenger car market is still greatly under penetrated and because Tata has varied domestic and international product lines that it s continuously working to improve  the company is well positioned to keep growing quickly  I think analyst projections for earnings per share  EPS  to rise an astounding 40  per year for at least the next few years are feasible  At that rate  EPS would climb from  3 20 in 2011 to  8 78 in 2014    Risks to Consider  Failure to sufficiently rehab the Nano s image could hurt  since the Nano accounts for a decent portion    about 6     of the roughly 140 000 motor vehicles of all types Tata currently sells each month  If the issue isn t adequately addressed  then competition could erode profits  Renault and Bajaj Auto  for example  have already announced their intention to launch a jointly produced  ultra low cost small car to compete with the Nano starting sometime in 2012    Despite the Nano s issues  I think Tata Motors is an excellent auto stock to own  In India  its biggest market  car ownership rates are still extremely low    only eight per 1 000 people  As the biggest car manufacturer in India  Tata should be able to take good advantage of rapidly increasing demand for cars  which analysts predict will expand by at least 10 12  in 2012 and 2013  Moreover  in the hands of Tata management  the estimated value of the JLR division has soared nearly six fold to about  14 billion from the  2 5 billion purchase price  BY Tim

I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr  Raghunandhan N  L  from Emkay Global  Thank you and over to you  sir 
Raghunandhan N  L     Assistant Vice President
Thank you  Stanford  Good evening  everyone  I would like to welcome the management and thank them for giving us this opportunity  We have with us today Mr  P B  Balaji  Group s CFO  Tata Motors  Butschek  MD and CEO  Tata Motors  Professor Sir Ralf Speth  CEO  JLR  Mr  Adrian Mardell  CFO  JLR 
I would now hand over the call to the management for opening remarks  Over to you  sir 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  Thanks  Raghu  Thanks all of you for joining the call  Unfortunately  Ralf is not able to join this particular call  From our side  we also have Shailesh  who Heads our EV business as well as Girish  who Heads our CV business has joined the discussions as well  So without further ado  let me cut to the chase  Like last time  I don t intend to cover every slide  You already have the deck in front of you  I ll draw your attention to the page number on the right corner  right hand top corner and we will then roll with that 
So moving on to slide two  which is the standard disclosure  And thereafter  let me move to slide three  The key developments and this has been an intense quarter for both JLR and Tata Motors  In the case of Tata Motors  I particularly draw your attention to the almost fully packed agenda that we have had on passenger vehicles as we move to the BSVI beyond New Forever as well as the BSVI and beyond  And the launch of the Altroz with 5 Star GNCAP  the second car from Tata Motors and in India  which is 5 Star GNCAP  and of course  the launch of the entire Tata Universe ecosystem  which has delivered the Nexon EV as well  So Shailesh will talk about that later in the call  but these three were exciting  And of course  JLR  the much awaited Defender production commences and a series of product launches starting with F TYPE begins  And of course  the first was into infra technology  which was revealed at the CES  So as we had committed earlier  product defensive continues  innovation continues 
Moving on to the numbers  It s been a quarter  where I think we had a fair number of challenges that we had to deal with  And in that context  I think delivering an EBITDA of 9 9  for the quarter has been good  Revenue growth  of course  has been negative 7  and EBITDA of 240 bps and particularly reassuring the free cash flow line at positive INR4 000 crores for the quarter  In the case of G A  if I were to just summarize the entire performance of the quarter  the continued recovery in JLR China  favorable mix  and of course India eminently declined despite market share gains  sequential gains and of course  continued BSIV stock reductions in India  This is a broad factor that actually contributed and of course  the details are there in the subsequent slides as well 
I ll also draw your attention to the last year same time  we had a GBP3 1 billion impairment that was there  And therefore  that s where the comparable number on exceptional needs to be taken note of  Revenue  if I split the revenue up  you will notice volume and mix price and translation all went the other way and it s almost entirely the decline in Tata Motors stand alone is probably what led the revenue to decline to this extent  In Tata Motors  the good part is what we committed the retails will be higher than wholesale  higher than production  that continued  and therefore  retail growth higher than the wholesale growth  but suffice it is to say that this growth is not good enough  And overall  we do have a challenge with respect to the market condition  which we ll talk about at a later point in time  later in the deck 
On the EBIT numbers  moving to slide six  the increase in JLR contributed almost 4 5  in the improvement of the overall EBIT number while Tata Motors stand alone totaled about 1 9  out of that  So there is overall EBIT moved from minus 0 1  to plus 2 3  and here  again  we ll spend a little bit of time later 
So with this let me hand this over to Adrian to talk about JLR in slightly more detail and I ll take it back when I talk Tata Motors  Adrian  over to you 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yeah  Thanks  Balaji  and good afternoon  evening everybody on the line  Let me quickly go through the Jaguar Land Rover details  I think the first thing to note  volumes  retail volumes versus the same quarter last year were actually a little bit lower  2 3   Profitability  GBP318 million  a substantial GBP591 million stronger than the same quarter last year  Investment down a little bit  just under GBP900 million  That s probably going to lift up over the course of the next six months or so  but well within our target guidance we ve given already free cash outflow  GBP144 million and cash balance at the end of the quarter GBP3 9 billion excluding the revolving credit facility 
If we go into the volume details  there s a tale of three or four stores  We break this down by region  of course  overall  the 2  lower  but that includes a substantial 24  increase in China  So that s two full quarters of substantial double digit increases we ve had as we signaled last time  So the performance in China was very much what we were signaling when we spoke to you in October  UK is down  11  year over year  most of those are low margin products  a lot of that activity was deliberately taken from the marketplace for that reason  And Europe is 10  lower versus same quarter last year  almost all of that is actually I PACE sales in the Netherlands  There was a tax change on benefits in kind actually  in January 2019  which drove increases artificially high in comparative quarter that we have for Europe here  So binary  almost all of that would be I PACE 
Next page  if you would  This breaks it down actually by vehicle line  You can see there the Evoque continues to be a strong performer versus the same quarter last year  So the new model has landed well as we expected to do  up 30  in the quarter  and Discovery is bought up 9   but as you will see later  that increase really was driven in December and we ll continue to believe going forward  Range Rover was down versus the same quarter last year  Mostly  again  binary in the Middle East  where as you would estimate there are substantial geopolitical challenges in it 
In terms of the PV versus the same quarter last year  this is where you can see the huge improvement  2 5  negative EBIT last year  3 3  positive this year  Volume and mix  broadly the same  We do continue to have higher marketing costs  So this is a continuation of the story that I signaled in October although 0 4  of that increase is actually the residual value issue we have on 16 models in BSVI  I continue to believe that is contained to the extended  16 model year period again  exactly the same as we talked about last time  This is where the cost reduction efforts under project charge continued to flow through aggressively  manufacturing and material costs  plus our structural cost reductions here  We did have bad news on labor and overhead  which is a throwback to the comment I made last time over the cars in Q3 
We also had a very  very strong net exchange number  although overwhelmingly its revaluation of the balance sheet due to the 6  appreciation of sterling in quarter three  But if you look at the contribution cost improvements and the structural cost improvements that broadly adds up to the GBP300 million profit in the quarter  We thought one of the questions we ll get today was how does it compare to the previous quarters  So we thought it would be helpful to lay this out  the 4 8  versus the 3 3  since there s a number of things running around  but broadly speaking volume performance and our CJLR performance is better  VME in the marketplace is slightly worse  but anticipated to be broadly at this level over the next three to six months 
There are increases in manufacturing and material costs  Most of those are binary one off items  Of course  we re trying to launch the New Defender  which is a piece of that  There were commodity cost increases in the quarter also a piece of that and a payable in our Nitra facility  But they were increases that came through versus prior quarter  but you would have seen on the previous slide that page was still substantially lower versus the same last year  The labor and overhead I ve mentioned already as a result of lower build levels although versus last quarter we were more efficient again on lower D A because the spend is starting to come through as lower D A here 
And then the exchange story  which broadly speaking is appreciation  bad news on operating hedging doing the job you d expect it to do and the revaluation of the balance sheet  as I ve mentioned already  The commodity hedges that are throwback to the hedges we have in place for those commodity cost increases  which I referred to within the contribution that walks quarter over quarter  And you ll notice there that the substantive reason for the EBIT deterioration is actually in exchange 
If you go to the next page  it shows our cash outflow for the period  GBP144 million  Technical Issues  same quarter last year  We have talked before about balancing our cash profit and investment  we re a little bit short in the quarter  but there s a huge amount of activity  actually on working capital  significant inventory reductions and also increases in volumes in trade receivables  But at the end of the quarter  we were paying for less supplier parts because we didn t build because as I ve already referenced  Investment is GBP892 million in the quarter  You ll see versus prior year reductions in all places  including significantly lower capitalized R D  as you would expect than we previously signaled  In terms of our liquidity  obviously  much stronger at the end of the quarter  GBP3 9 billion worth of cash in our bank accounts  excluding the revolving credit facilities and I ll talk more about the debt position going forward 
The strategy  Okay  I mentioned Defender  You ll see there  December is the 20  increase versus the prior year  So as the vehicle becomes more available in more markets  the comparative year over year performance has improved  The Defender vehicle  of course  job one did happen on the 8th of January  as we indicated in October it was going to happen  Start of sales still continues to be spring as we indicated previously also the orders are still much stronger than a normal profile for the vehicle  I picked up my vehicle yesterday  It is sensational 
Next one  CO2 Emissions  we re still signaling the compliant portfolio in 2021  Of course  I talked before about the measurement system changing  you ll see there the detail of how we become increasingly compliant at lower levels  all of the 2021 signals have still got green ticks on them  Overwhelmingly  of course  customers will need to accept and take these products  So we re watching carefully the acceptance of our PHEV and our BEV sales over the course of the next 12 months to ensure that we can be compliant through sales of compliant vehicles  Those vehicles are in place 
In terms of Project Charge  as I signaled last time  we were going to exceed the target within this quarter and we did quite substantially  actually  to date  GBP2 9 billion worth of cash savings have been generated from the program  You see the split there  significant increase in Q3 investments and working capital  particularly the levels were a lot lower at the end of December than they were at the start of the financial year and then another GBP200 million on cost and profits as shown mostly on that previous slide  which I broke down the year over year data on  What we re doing going forward on Charge  Well  we are continuing  We re calling it Charge    The plus is an extra fiscal year  We re going through to March 21  We re signaling here the value we expect to be able to get over the next 15 months broken down by an expectation of an improved GBP400 million position in Q4 and then GBP700 million more in  21 fiscal year  This is the program  I also indicated last time that most of the program would shift to and EBIT and a variable profit focus  So six of the eight large work streams we are continuing with are those  although  of course  you would expect us to want to continue our inventory discipline  which has been excellent in the quarter and our reduced investment spend  which continues to apply the rigors and  therefore  the under spend levels  we expect to continue going forward also  although investment will peak in the next six months or so 
Just wanted to draw your attention to one last item in this section  a significant piece of the FY  21 improvements on Charge   will be material cost  We have a huge amount of initiatives in place to lower the spend within our vehicles  We are doing really well  You will see some benefits of that in quarter four to a normal closeout of our deals with suppliers  but we expect to do even more in  21 fiscal year  We ve laid out a bit more detail there as you can see the approach  We ve effectively got the car breaks down into 34 component or commodity categories and each one is having a thorough review  We re in the phases of the first nine at the moment  We will obviously bring you more details on that program as we go forward 
And finally  this page is pretty much as we ve said over the last six months  As indicated last time  FY  20 is around 3   I do have to warn that  obviously  the position in China is evolving and developing  And you have seen over the last six months  a significant improvement in our China operation  So there is a big care point about  obviously  what happens from the China market  All of our thoughts are now with the people  the friends  the families and the communities we know in China  which  of course  is paramount consideration here  Next year  FY  21  we believe will be in the 3  to 4  range  as previously indicated  Investments  I am signaling the full year number is going to be lower still  up to GBP3 6 billion is the new number for this year  The guidance for next year is still GBP4 billion 
And then we do remain confident on achieving our plans  I do mention here  you see the Corona virus  again  which will unfold over the next several weeks  But of course  we ll focus  continuing to launch in the exciting products and the breakthrough technology  You saw there the eSIM technology with Defender  which enables software over the air on the move  while live streaming  which is pretty neat  improved PBT and cash flow  of course  and then deliver the charge program  which fundamentally has underpinned the turnaround of this organization over the last 18 months  I m very proud to say  finally  the Annual Investor Day we re announcing here to be the 18th of June 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Well  thanks  Adrian  Let me quickly run past Tata Motor s stand alone domestic numbers here  Wholesale were down 25   combination of both market as well as system stock reduction  You ll recollect that we did not talk about INR3 400 crores of inventory system stock last quarter  so we have done another INR3 800 this quarter  And this is now both at our end and the dealer end  At the same time  revenue is down 33  fundamentally with an increasing competitiveness as well as VME increases that you re seeing in the market because of the disposal of BSIV sock  EBITDA at 1 1  down 800 bps as you could see there and fundamentally led all of the M HCV decline of 48   which obviously impacts the mix  And the net one off expenses also was about INR155 crores for the quarter 
Free cash flow is an area that we were consciously called out last quarter  something that we would want to turn that number and make it positive  Happy to report that we landed at INR2 400 crores of positive free cash flows for the quarter and most of it driven out of working capital improvement that we had committed to  The interesting piece as far as M HCV decline is concerned that the market shares are being increasing sequentially as well and year on year basis as well  So we are now saying  OK  fine  we just need the market return beyond this  PBT bridge  if you were just call out  it s fundamentally led out of volume mix and net pricing  and we talked about the VME piece as well  Every other line item  we have managed to keep it under control and the overall performance fundamentally linked to lower volumes as well as mix in higher VMEs 
On slide 29  it s similar amount quarter on quarter  what has moved  You will notice that a slight pickup in volumes  offset by a higher VME  And of course  last quarter  had the one off that was there in the PV write off and that if you offset it this time around the total number actually starts increasing  So overall  what we can control as costs  I think we kept a tight leash  What we can control the share  we have managed to secure  We just need the volumes to start coming through as well 
Free cash flow is positive  as I called out bulk of it coming out of working capital changes  And this is something that we intend to keep a tight leash going forward as well  Investment spending is about INR1 300 crores  We expect to end the year at INR4 500 crores inline with what we have seen last time  all of it mainly into BSVI and new products  and you ve seen the product offensive that happened earlier in January and we can talk about it as well 
CV s overall numbers  you see the market share increase coming through in M HCV and ILCV  Recently  what we are starting to observe is that we re starting to see enquiries starting to increase  replacement demand and hopefully in government s trust on infrastructure investments are expected soon  should help demand  Realizations are starting to increase as well starting in December and early indications have been seen  So it does give us a lot of hope as we look into Q4  but this trend should continue and we gradually work our way out of the problem that we are at 
On the priorities for us  I think the entire focus of the team is on BSVI transition  The ecosystem viability  dealer performance  profitability that has come through quite well for us and we ve continued to keep it that way and being enjoyed to tap the demand recoveries are number one focus at this point in time  And retail is being more than wholesale something that we called out and we ve continue to report on that particular fund that we re in the right track 
On the commercial vehicle piece on the EBITDA number  in particular  there is a one time impact of the wholesale tax ratio of 2002 to 2005    2006  I mean  and the law didn t change thereafter  so this issue is now    we have settled this all the indirect tax dispute and that s had a one time impact of close to about 3  on the EBITDA number  And on top of the other issues of VME and make something that does play out here  On the BSVI update  it s a rich pipeline of intervention that is there  I think our products are ready and we will be starting to hit the market in the coming days  And the March is going to be the month where we ll be shifting gears completely there  which requires the new fuel also to come in  And as a team  the obsolescence management is very much under control and we hope to land firstly on that particular front 
And our entire focus is on getting field ready  which also is now more or less done and dusted and we then go to the next level into the dealers  mechanics as well  And so we are in a good place  And the key thing that we want to follow up on BSVI and we ve already seen that in passenger vehicles and that s what we ll play out in CV as well  This is not just about compliance  it s about adding value and going beyond  And therefore  this adding value could be in any form  be it improved TCO  increased earnings  value enhancements  whatever it may be  But the consumer needs to get excited about the BSVI product  and that s how we intend to play that  And I m sure you would want to have Girish talking about it later as well 
On PV side  again  retails 35  higher than wholesale  This is now completely refreshed product portfolio  We have also cleaned out the distribution network in its entirety as of end of Jan  And we re also very  very excited about the product offensive  Tata Altroz now receiving a 5 star Global NCAP  which we talked about earlier  And we have seamlessly transitioned into BSVI  This month the build up begins  And our systems stock is at a multi quarter low  Very  very healthy on both CV and PV at the stock level  And therefore  ability to win    get back on our momentum is pretty high 
On the revenue  on the overall P L on the PV side  growth down 19   EBITDA margins at minus 3 6   a significant improvement from last time  Again  coming on the back of the one off write offs that was there  And now we re starting to trend back into where we ought to be  but not good enough  Needs to break even and go forward as well  But the good part of the PV side is that the contribution margin continues to improve and the Turnaround 2 0 momentum is starting to come back again as we are starting to pick up volumes 
And the BSVI range  you saw it on the press on Jan 22  every one of our products has been relaunched  And we are probably the only one in the world who has done it in this intensity that s found right across  And now the sales starts from here onwards  And in particular  what we d like to call out is there s a commonality in approach  be it on the design benchmark  be it on the safety call out that we have done  We have 5 star GNCAP in Nexon and Altroz  4 star in Tiago  Tigor  So we want to be best in class safety in any category that we want to play  And of course  not just the compliance  we would want to go beyond BSVI on all things  connectivity  So we have now intelligent real time assist coming on board  And the whole thing is about the pleasure of driving  So clearly an all encompassing full blast launch is how we plan to do  And this then brings in the new phase of PV as far as Tata Motors is concerned 
And then  of course  is EV  which I m sure Shailesh will talk about it  And why don t    hand it over to Shailesh because he has just come back from the Tata Universe launch 
Shailesh Chandra    President Electric Mobility Business and Corporate Strategy
Yeah  So as far as quarter three is concerned  we were a market leader with 47  market share  And which takes us to a market share figure of 43  year to date for this financial year  And this has been on the back of the success of the newly launched Tigor EV  with extended range of 213 kilometers  which has been received very well by the fleet segment  It is now the highest selling EV in India year to date Tigor EV  Also  we unveiled first EV build state of the art Ziptron technology  And the first product that we launched day before yesterday is the Nexon EV with a certified range of 312 kilometer 
We had also done a media drive for this Nexon EV  and the verdict that we got from most of the media people is that it s the most promising EV available in the market  And we have been receiving very strong bookings and response from the customer  We also had worked on the Ford Eco system around the Nexon EV  And there are five other Tata companies who have participated in this ecosystem  Therefore  Tata Power has already installed nearly 100 public charges across five cities  And by this financial year end  we are targeting to do about 300 in these five cities  Taco has localized the battery pack  And going forward  we have plans to also localize motor for us  Chroma  we have tried to do a very innovative concept  which is the store in store concept for giving an immersive experience is to experience for Nexon EV  And these tools therefore  book and book test drive  as well as the car if the customer is interested in 
Tata Chemicals has also been working with us for cell manufacturing  And we are going to start the pilot plant in Dholera  in Gujarat  And we also Tata Motors Finance which has been working with us on different kind of financing solution for fleet  as well as personal segment buyers  The focus for the next six months is going to be  continue to develop the fleet segment  which has been the bread and butter of the electric vehicle segment in the last nine months  We are going to scale up our demand for Nexon EV and also work on the supply also because the response in the market has been very strong 
We ll also work with Tata Power to accelerate the process of public charging networks in the five cities and the focus at least that we have identified  And we also announced that in the next two years  we would be introducing total of four vehicles  which includes the next one we need and the work will be on in the next six months itself  And we are also working on the localization of critical EV components in line with the phase manufacturing plan of saving program  And of course  we will continue to focus on improving the profitability through direct material cost reduction efforts 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
So thank you  So basically  the entire strategy of running proactively playing out as we had indicated and these are the specs of the new cars that you hold debt  and happy to talk about it in the Q A if we need  Motorfinance has started its division is starting to improve in the market with respect to collections  We had a quarter  where AUM was at INR37 000 crore rupees  Our disposal has obviously slowed down as the M HCV business  in particular  started to slow down  Funding has not been an issue  We have been raising funds  And we managed to securitize in the last nine months  almost INR3 000 crore rupees of book that we had and the record is very reassuring that the collections are now starting to increase from December 2019  We had a very good December and we hope to continue that even January seems to be trending  right  So  I think we are starting to see this business coming back and all the stress is fundamentally related to the M HCV portfolio  All other portfolios  be it ILCV  be it small commercial vehicles  passenger vehicle  the GMP and PVD trends are quite comfortable  It is fundamentally medium and heavy commercial  where you re not worried  because these are strategic accounts and we expect to see them coming back pretty soon 
On the net debt side  just a quick flash on the    how the bond issuances have performed both in JLR and TML  reassuring to see the YTMs on the bonds in both JLR and TML trending the right way and the performance of the business starts improving and as well as some of the more macro impacts like Brexit started to come off  And we have also had an issuance in JLR of almost GBP1 6 billion and EML had an issuance of    had funds coming in of almost INR1 500 crores this year  this including the private equity  So funding situation is extremely solid  And overall  net automotive debt is now down about INR45 000 crores to INR50 000 crores earlier in September  And maturity is in a very good place as well  Overall  liquidity for JLR is GBP5 8 million in last year  And Tata Motors stand alone at INR10 200 crores  So we are well funded and adequate in liquidity 
So moving on to the outlook  I think there s other ones  which are normal  the only thing I can draw your attention to is China and India  Where I think in China  the corona viruses is developing as we speak  with a    you also need to look at it  they don t able to get visibility of what the situation on the ground is with respect to not just the demand  but also the extended supply chain  And that is something that we need to keep a close watch on  Next week should be better in terms of information as people come back gradually from their Chinese New Year  India  of course  a sharp economic slowdown and the turnaround is something that we are seeing on that front  In that context  I think there s broadly no change to the outlook that we have put out there  where for JLR  we are looking at an EBIT of around 3  for the year  And of course  the coronavirus is something that we could have some impact  we need to watch that 
And of course  the delivery of charge plus of GBP1 1 billion going forward is something is a free power for that business  apart from  of course  the traditional launching of exciting products and the cash flow  Tata Motors  I think  the medium to long term plan  the fact that now sequentially  they re starting to see improvement  We are reassured but of course  the key one is the immediate term  what happens to the market demand  post BSVI migration  For the next six months  we do expect to be in a fluid situation  and let s see that after what happens 
So with that  let me stop  And if I go to the next slide  these are the two critical dates where we expect to see you in person  Tata Motors India would have on 12 June in India and JLR 18 June in the UK and look forward to seeing you there 
So let me hand you over back to Q A 
Questions and Answers 
Operator
Thank you very much sir  Ladies and gentlemen  we will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  The first question is from the line of Yogesh Aggarwal from HSBC  Please go ahead 
Yogesh Aggarwal    HSBC    Analyst
Yeah  Hi  A couple of questions for me just related to JLR  It seems the CO2 target in Europe has further  I mean  it has changed  I thought it used to be 132 grams for 2021  and it has now changed to 156 grams  So has there been any change in the way the portfolio has and so the requirement is different  And then related to that  see  this year  there is a feeling that some of the large OEMs will refocus on the larger vehicles to achieve their CO2 requirements  And you guys seems to be comfortable  Is there a scope to gain some market share in the larger SUV space in Europe  And then lastly  anything on I PACE  Seems like numbers are not picking up either in US or in China  So anything around I PACE  And how do you see I PACE ramping up 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Adrian  want to take that 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yes  Certainly  yeah  I ll take that  Let me start off with the last one  if you wouldn t mind  So I PACE volumes are very sensitive to incentives within government  You ve seen that particularly within this quarter data versus the prior year  Netherlands  particularly Netherlands  actually in the quarter  2 500 units lower than the same quarter last year as benefits in kind increasing from 4  to 13  in January 2019  So that s a really large illustration of what the marketplace is currently thinking about our I PACE  There are recourse benefit in kind changes  which are going to actually kick in April this year in the UK  And we expect our UK volumes off the back of that to increase 
Now in terms of the targets that we actually have set  We know we ve talked to you before  about the actual target setting regime having changed  So we are actually showing it here versus the 156 WLTP level in  21 calendar year  We think we ll be compliant against that  But the big point here is the link  that s why I started off with I PACE  of course  the big point here is it really does depend on the acceptance of the customer with the products that we have made available  We ve also shown on this page  all of the actions we re taking on whole portfolio to make electrification available to all of our customers and potential customers from MHEVs  And if you remember  we showed last time in MHEVs  itself drives the 12  reduced CO2 level to a PHEV  And if you remember from last time  a PHEV will drive a 70  reduction in the CO2 level  And of course  the BEV is a 100  reduction  So the vehicles are available for the customers to buy the incentivization really does drive that tipping point of excess demand 
We are expecting improvements in the U K  market going forward from April  And you can see there on the page  there s a huge amount of other activity happening with our engineering factories with smaller  smaller ICE engines  obviously  the MLA platform being using lighter weight materials and several other things allow thousands of engineers are working on  I think the big unknown over the next 12 months  really  will be the acceptance of not only the I PACE  which you asked about  but the other PHEVs that we bring in place  Don t forget the Discovery Sport gets a PHEV in the first quarter of next fiscal year  That is our biggest selling product  So the response to consumers and customers to Discovery Sport will be huge in terms of our position over the course of the next 12 months  but the cars are available 
Could you repeat your middle question  if you wouldn t mind  please

So I was wondering  there are two things happening  There are some launches like X7  Q8 in the larger SUV space  but there is a thought process that to achieve that CO2 target  some of the OEMs will be focused on the larger SUV  This kind of give you guys an opportunity to gain some share  at least for the top end Range Rover  So is this something you are looking at 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Look  we re balancing out the optimized position for profitability and being compliance  So where we can actually drive more vehicles is the higher end of our range  Charge  actually has specific work streams around that  So we will certainly be looking to do that  When you look at our higher end wave  and of course  they have PHEV offerings within them as well  of course  right  When you look at our high range vehicles and the performance  Range Rover Sport  even though it s in year seven is actually higher versus the same quarter last year  And Range Rover is a bit lower and that overwhelmingly is a result of the issues that the world has in the Middle East  So both of those cars are selling extremely well  and we expect them to do so over the course of the next 12 months  A care point around how many PHEVs actually gets sold  That was as high as 20  over the last few months  So we are hopeful  we continue to drive high value margin vehicles  which have PHEVs in them as well

The next question is from the line of Pramod Amthe from CGS CIMB  Please go ahead 
Pramod Amthe    CIMB Research    Analyst
Yeah  hi  This is with regard to your Charge  program  where you seems to have taken up a pretty aggressive target  And of which nearly 35   40  is front loaded in this quarter  Is it because of the low hanging fruit  Or you guys started working on it much earlier in the course  And why it gives you so much of confidence 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yeah  there s two or three things specific to quarter four  Most of them are continuation of programs  So there may be a little bit more investment  not very much  But the material cost  most of our segments actually happened in the final quarter of the year and which    we are now in the final quarter  So I d expect a bigger proportion of the saves actually being on the material cost program  And you ve seen for the last two to three quarters  we ve had really strong performance on structural cost reductions as well  and we expect that to continue  So we will definitely have a fast start to the GBP1 1 billion in quarter four  and we were just being helpful by breaking that out for you 
Pramod Amthe    CIMB Research    Analyst
And the second one is with regard to Defender  you did try to give some indications on the same  But can you give us some color in terms of what type of capacity headroom you have  as you indicated  you guys are surprised by the initial response  And what potentially it was in your portfolio in terms of proportion of mix it can bring in 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yeah  I won t give you any detailed numbers  I ll simply say  at this point  bear in the mind  we haven t confirmed sales dates  We have more than a three month order book  And that s pretty neat at this point in time  So let s see how the next three months go  We ll be able to confirm when we next talk formally that the vehicle is now on sale  And I ll be in a much better position to ask those specific questions  I mean  broadly speaking  the first sales of any vehicle is always very rich  Because most of the people like the new vehicles  specify them very highly  So I wouldn t want to mislead you and give you the data that we have in front of us

Thank you  The next question is from the line of Robin Zhu from Bernstein  Please go ahead 
Robin Zhu    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     Analyst
Thanks guys  Two questions  please  One  in terms of the variable material cost savings that you pointed to as part of Charge   Just wanted to understand the drivers of this  Is this something that s dependent on    you guys given the supplies more volume  Is it something associated with higher MLA volumes and the components of the new platform have lower cost  Is it simply that you ve got better pricing like for like from the same suppliers  Some color on that would be helpful  Second question  could you quantify what warranty costs were during Q3  And Balaji  when you and I spoke a few months ago  you had indicated that you weren t confident to guide a range lower than 4  to 6   Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on where are we in that process  Are you still thinking to the 4  to 6   Or are we close to potentially going lower  Thank you 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Let me take the first couple of questions that you asked  Robin  So variable material cost  I would actually point to the difference the Charge program has brought  Don t forget what we re doing with this program  we re wrapping all of our specialist teams around a host function  So all of our analytics teams  our ability to really analyze and truly have data in front of us  which enables us to what we would suggest to claim an appropriate level of savings from the supplier  And it s broadly over the course of this year versus last year  driven  I think  by the time we re done up to GBP100 million extra cost savings  Most of those settlements actually will be closed over the next three months  one third of them have been closed in January  Yes  from time to time  there are MLA or any other future products used as leverage  of course  an excellent batch from our MLA mid and high volumes  But it isn t really the overwhelming substantive piece of the negotiating settlement  Most of them is the forensic analysis that we have actually been able to do  Warranty costs  warranty costs as a percentage of revenue was pretty much smack on what we were saying as underlying anyway  pretty much smack on what we were indicating last time  It was about 4   However  one of the impacts we had here as a result of the appreciation of sterling is the warranty liabilities actually reduced like for like  And therefore  the optical number you ll see in warranty is a little bit lower  I think  3 4  of revenue  But that s the underlying  It stood at about 4  level  which was the range I indicated to you about six months ago 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Robin  can you just repeat your question that you had I lost you in between 
Robin Zhu    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     Analyst
Yes  So I think one of the times we spoke  you had said that you have to guide 4  to 6  for warranty costs  And you want you didn t want to disappoint the market by guiding lower because there were still  I guess  the potential for surprises every now and then  Is that still the case  Is the potential for surprise still there  How close do you think the company is to saying  OK  4  to 6  is far too higher a range and we can start to go lower 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
I think I mentioned that you may have followed up with Balaji  but I think I mentioned that pretty much in the first call I did in July  4  to 6  was mentioned at that point in time because the first quarter was at the 6  level  And I think I attempted to say there s a band here  Underlying performance  my expectation will be closer to 4   However  we ve also signaled  we will do the right thing  And therefore  if we come along  we ll call as soon we need to  And if there s opportunity to do customer care campaigns as we did in quarter one  which we feel ultimately will be a payback for the organization  We will take those as well  Over the course of the last six months  neither of those two items have actually happened  Underlying over that period has been at the 4  level  We obviously are working tremendously hard in several areas  including to improve the efficiency and the capability in the engineering factory  We track all the early data to see that  There are very small signs of improvement  but it s far too early for us to show them in the financial results 
We have a rules of the road for warranty  which was set eight years ago  will continue because it enables individual vehicles to make sure before we actually show the individual performance  You know we come off the back of disappointing launches on  18 and  19 model years  And we are determined to make sure we get Defender right which is why we re continuing to work on that product  We re continuing to hold it and give a release date for the spring because we want to make sure it s released to the marketplace when it s ready  So everything we re doing is attempting to improve the immediate quality performance and accelerate it there to improve it with a new vehicle quality  So I will continue to say 4  to 6   only because it gives us the capability to do the right thing at the right time  But over the last two to three quarters  underlying has been close to 4  
Robin Zhu    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     Analyst
Understood  If I may  It sounded like from what you said on variable material costs that most of the savings you will achieve through your forensic analysis  but essentially getting better like for like pricing from the same suppliers  Would you say that s correct 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yeah  I mean  there are so many things that go into that line item  as I m sure you know  But what we find though here  we try and pull out the non variables like commodities and such  And yes  like to like pricing has actually reduced from a number of our suppliers 
Robin Zhu    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     Analyst

Thank you  The next question is from the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura Securities  Please go ahead 
Kapil R  Singh    Nomura Securities Co  Ltd     Analyst
H sir  thanks for the opportunity  One question  firstly  on the financials  We ve seen a bit of volatility in the raw material to sales ratio  Last quarter  we saw a big improvement  And then this quarter  there s been a sharp increase  So what is the key reason for this  And also  if you can explain on the depreciation charge  which has seen a sharp drop 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Kapil is referring to consolidated numbers 
Kapil R  Singh    Nomura Securities Co  Ltd     Analyst
For Jaguar and Land Rover 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Well  OK  So raw materials to sales  It encompasses pieces that I d just mentioned  but there are several other elements in there  There were increases in commodity costs in the quarter  I think PGM increased by about 9  clearly the procurements on the mix of vehicles we sell  the derivatives of vehicles we sell and where we actually sell them within  We did have a rich sales mix profile in the quarter  which generally means the material cost pieces increase also and as well  So there are numerous factors that are involved here  What we attempt to do within the analysis is work  And of course  exchange rates is a huge factor  particularly movements on the euro as well because we buy a lot of our parts from Europe 
What we attempt to do with the analysis for you is draw out all the things and then consolidate it down to what we would consider to be the performance driven items  which is really back to the distributor  Technical Issues 
Hello 
Operator
You may go ahead  sir 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
So what I tend to do is make sure we point to the actual underlying pieces  which I think are the ones that will determine performance going forward  Hence  the previous discussion about our efforts to reduce like for like material costs with suppliers  which we just had with Robert 
Kapil R  Singh    Nomura Securities Co  Ltd     Analyst
Okay  And the depreciation charge is also seeing a drop  Any color there  How it will shape up with the Defender launch 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yes  Well  the Defender launch  obviously  from job one which was on the 8th of January  we start to increase the depreciation charges  They will increase in this quarter year end  And going forward  that product  we are convinced is going to be successful  So the overall product will return to the bottom line even after increases in investment costs 
Kapil R  Singh    Nomura Securities Co  Ltd     Analyst
Okay  And just one more  I wanted to check on the product launch side  How many new products are we looking at over the next two to three years on both the Jaguar and Land Rover brand  Whether it s a full model changeover or a completely new brand 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
I won t give you numbers of models  But our cadence still continues to be that seven or eight year replacement cycle  And there are likely to be two all new products on top of that  one of each 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
With a mid cycle refresh in between 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yeah  So there s a lot of activity  When you go into the presentation   
Kapil R  Singh    Nomura Securities Co  Ltd     Analyst
Is it Jaguar or Land Rover 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Both  When you go into the presentation  you ll see the immediate one there  even the F Type  which I could have excluded from that discussion  We ve done a super new launch on the Jaguar F TYPE  It goes on sale later this quarter  And of course  we talked about the Defender already

Thank you  The next question is from the line of Sonal Gupta from UBS Securities  Please go ahead 
Sonal Gupta    UBS Investment Bank    Analyst
Hi  good evening  Thanks for taking my question  Two questions from my side  One  starting off with the Jaguar Land Rover question  I mean  basically  as you ve overachieved on the targets in Charge  but you ve sort of underachieved on the cost and profit  the operating costs  Why I m stressing on that is basically from the cost structure side  I mean  the improvement is probably still not that high  So I just want to understand  like  I mean  like  are there  I mean  I know you re continuing with that and sort of going to improve further  but still I mean  like  are we seeing any room for I mean  the focus of Charge  also seems to be more variable  I mean  on the fixed cost side  do we see room to cut costs more  I mean  we ve seen  again  the employee cost has sequentially increased  So just want to understand how much of fixed cost reduction do we expect going forward 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Let me correct you for the first point you made  if you don t mind    let me correct the first point  if you don t mind  We haven t yet missed any of the targets on the Charge or the Charge  program  We did say we would deliver GBP1 billion profit improvement through to March 2020  where it s GBP700 million after the first four quarters of that  You can see for the last two quarters  at least  we delivered GBP200 million a quarter  That gets you very close and I ve referred to material costs already  So we haven t yet given up on the GBP1 billion target we set  although we have rolled the targets for another 12 months beyond that  As far as structural costs are concerned  they are GBP200 million a quarter lower than the same quarter last year  That s pretty neat  we think 
And yes  we continue to ensure that we don t add costs where we don t need to  And we continue to take actions where we still have inefficiencies within our operations  And we ll start to hear some more of those going forward when we re at a point to pay  So I think we re doing a pretty neat job  There s always more you can do  We re trying to balance the cost structure and our ability to ensure that we can take revenue growth opportunities also  And that s what we package really uniquely within the Charge  program  And I think when we talk in May time  you ll get a much better sense of follow up to your first question  And how much we expect the proportion to that new program to start showing the value in  21 fiscal year 
Sonal Gupta    UBS Investment Bank    Analyst
Sure 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
To add to that    Sonal  talk to you in a minute  Just to put in perspective the way we have gone about doing some event after cash first and then we went after the fixed cost structures  And now we realized it s an area where there s always the opportunities to improve  I m not debating that  But I think there s a bigger price to be had with respect to variable cost  Similarly  we have to decide where to focus our people and efforts on  So we are now moving on those areas where variable costs can be there  should be focused and taken out  And that will then give you an overall break even that will start coming down  We need to work on both the numerator and the denominator  if you are to get the break even stock  So that s how the sequencing has been done in line with the kind of issues we had a year back on cash and operating leverage  Now we are saying that is not the main issue now  We now need to start looking at other side of it  So it s just a calibration as such 
Sonal Gupta    UBS Investment Bank    Analyst
Just a follow up on that  I mean  the recent news flow around 500 reduction in Halewood  That s part of the existing employee reduction  right  That s not a fresh thing 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
I mean  individual programs we announce when ready  So the 500 people who will be leaving our Halewood facilities in April  It s an efficiency program  We re going to speed up the line and therefore  we need fewer people  We re going to invest up to GBP5 million to break bottlenecks on the line as a super payback  It s a similar    as I ve just said  it s a great illustration of how we will continue to take the opportunities as they arise to become more efficient 
Sonal Gupta    UBS Investment Bank    Analyst
Okay  And my second question is on India  Basically  what I m confused about a little bit is that the realization per unit has dropped like 12  quarter on quarter  even though I don t really see the mix change being that sharp  right  So MSC  I understand is slightly lower  And exports is the main one  which has gone lower  So I just want to understand is there something getting knocked out of the top line itself  which is sort of pushing the ASPs lower  Elaborate 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
I think the main one that we have called out is the increase in VME that is there    the quarter on quarter number that is there  You will notice that there is a pricing that has got impacted because of the higher VME as we clear out the BSIV inventory in its entirety  The earlier we do it  the lower the cost  and the later we do  the higher it is  And that s the reason your realizations are down  And hence  you will see the challenge there 
Sonal Gupta    UBS Investment Bank    Analyst
And sorry  the INR340 crores  the sales tax  where is that sort of getting 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
That s invested in the other cost items  so    other expenses  work expenses 
Sonal Gupta    UBS Investment Bank    Analyst

Thank you  The next question is from the line of Ashwani Kumar from Nippon India Mutual Fund  Please go ahead 
Ashwani Kumar    Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited    Analyst
Yeah  Good evening  Mr  Adrian  My question was  what is the progress in China  if you could spare a few minutes describing how you are doing in China  And how is the strategy playing in China on cost improvement  quality improvements and the reach 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yeah  OK  Let me reference the AV  as I answer this initially  We can talk about the import business  if you wish so    wish to afterwards as well  So just a reminder to everybody  four out of our five nameplates within the JV are in refresh between August last year and June this year  You start to see within this quarter s results  the first full quarter of the new Evoque  And our marketing report on Evoque dropped by one third in the quarter  So that s encouraging  By far  the biggest impact in the JV over that period of time will be the new Discovery Sport  The Discovery Sport is due to go on sale on the 20th of February  It s half the volume for the CJLR business  Goes on sale on the 20th of February  Of course  with the sad event in China at the moment  that launch will be impacted  We re thinking about doing as a virtual online launch rather than a physical presentation initiative which we normally do  but that decision has yet not been finally made 
The virus will certainly impact Q4 results to what extent we ll know over the coming weeks  So the base business is getting stronger  As fresh product comes in place  you would expect that  Now we re targeting the operation to improve again in the quarter wherein  of course  the virus may impact  But if not  in the following quarter  So I m expecting the CJLR performance to be stronger  particularly that Discovery Sport product hits the marketplace later in the year  You know we talked last time about agreeing with the dealers that we would support the older product until that s flushed through  Discovery Sport has been selling really well actually in CJLR but it has an expensive discounting around it  Our strategy is to clear the old product before we get the new one  And that strategy was working perfectly well through to the third week in January 
In fact  our sales in China for the first week in January  both CJLR and pull were a little bit stronger than we were expecting  of course  as mentioned  2 times or 3 times already  that input we put on hold  My recommendation would be to judge the first quarter of our fiscal year next year  when you will see we all hope the improvements that we re expecting through the Discovery Sport  how momentum is built on the Evoque  And also we have XF long coming along at the end of that quarter  but that will be a smaller product launch for us  So getting better  not where we wanted to be  We re very aligned with our partners about what success looks like  And we ll be measuring that success on a quarter by quarter basis with an improving profile  Our import business was stronger  as you would have seen from the data  the big metal was stronger in quarter three for the Range Rover SUV 5  So we had a nice quarter for our China import business and the comments regarding this quarter would continue for China imports as well 
Ashwani Kumar    Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited    Analyst
And sir  what is the single most factor which is required for you to close the gap with the leaders in China financially also in light of Tesla s  let s say  opening factory there and starting to produce electric vehicles 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Well  you know we ve different models to Tesla in China  We don t have electric vehicle produced locally and their electric profile is very  very different to our electric profile  as you would know  also  of course  So our model is still overwhelmingly an import business  which has most of its products to be PHEV  mild hybrid  and ice engines at the minute  It s a lower volume  higher margin business model  as you would also know  And we re not too worried about what Tesla does  Actually  we re worried about being very  very focused on the fundamentals of our business  We ve talked to you about those fundamentals on several occasions  Making sure that the dealers are meeting their sales profiles locally 
They did even stronger than that in quarter three  but we did territorially already beaten those targets we set  making sure the dealers return to profitability  So they were profitable in quarter three  Again  we didn t show you that because we told you that in the previous quarter  making sure inventory was lighter  and they ve already achieved in a bit stronger on our inventory targets  So again  we didn t show you that because this is just a continuation of what we did in Q2 continue going forward  Let us get through Q4 and see what happens in China  And then if you wish for more information  we can start to show you more

Thank you  The next question is from the line of Chirag Shah from Edelweiss  Please go ahead 
Chirag Shah    Edelweiss Securities Ltd     Analyst
Thanks for the opportunity  So my first question is on India business  Two things  One  what is the normalized margin for the business  And the related point that I observe is to improve the cash flow  we are compromising on profitability  Is it the right analysis  So if you can just help us understand what is the normalized business because there was inventory clearance and there were certain one offs  So going ahead  how do we look at the margins in the India business 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  I think we have talked about    we have put out a margin plan out there  and we also stated that we are quite confident in the medium to long term situation there  And as far as the current situation is concerned  yes  there is an inventory correction  which we ve already quantified it as well  And at the same time  we are also seeing a lot of operating leverage because of the volumes  particularly in the medium and heavy commercial vehicles  We see margins starting to normalize   Indecipherable  starts lifting back to its normative level  And we would love to see that come sooner rather than later  As far as    I m not able to understand your question on working capital versus profitability  If you    if the question is you re asking me whether have we extended creditors and accordingly paying more broader    I mean paying of for it  the answer is a categorical no  And you would notice that every line item of the working capital is being worked  be it inventory  be it receivables  be it payables  all three  And that s how we would want to tighten the game plan there 
Chirag Shah    Edelweiss Securities Ltd     Analyst
So what I was referring to is your balance sheet and cash flow improvement seems to be far superior than your profitability performance in this quarter across businesses  So how should we look at the fine balance between the two going ahead 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  If I draw your attention to slide 13  basically it has the free cash flows for the quarter  You would recollect that this shows the working capital of one line that actually went out of whack in the first quarter  As we said that we did err in saying that we could anticipate the size of the market drop that happened  We just couldn t take it  And therefore  we were slow  And we started correcting it from July onwards  And you see an improvement that happened in July    in the last quarter  and it s now got secure  So I would not on a full year basis  the working capital number should normalize to 0  I am not expecting dramatic shifts  either increase or decrease  Don t hold me to the last one digit  but broadly  it needs to be stable because we are quite all right on the working capital side  It is the error in judging the market in the first quarters where the working capital went out of control 
So if you keep the working capital line aside and look at the cash profit after tax  and then compare that to the investment  our challenge has been on the cash profit after tax because of loss of operating  everything that we talked about earlier  So as we go forward  I think I m expecting the inventory corrections to more or less play a bottom out in Q4  And thereafter  the buildup of inventory in the dealer end will have to start and that then means you will have situations when our wholesales will be higher than retail  which is perfectly fine with the filling back the stock levels there  But that can t go way out of whack and it needs to be normatively done  And then you see the business starting to build to that momentum  But all this depends on how strong the retail growth is  and that is where the expectation that with the investments in infrastructure with the government has talked about and of course  the GDP starting to pick up  we should start seeing it 
And the day that starts moving  then you ll start the whole thing coming back to what it was  We were around two years  this business has run in terms of getting back  it s senior business  an EBITDA of 11 5  was a stable EBITDA that was there for many  many quarters  And therefore  that seems like a sensible number for this particular business  And PV  we are on our journey of building back the EBITDA to breakeven  which we ve delivered for a year  And we re now starting to come back again and get closer to that  and I ve said exclusively that we would want to get ahead of that and get to an EBIT breakeven and a PBT breakeven  That is the journey that we are on to  and we should get back to that journey  We ve already seen that sequentially improving this quarter  and we intend to keep it that way as we go forward 
Chirag Shah    Edelweiss Securities Ltd     Analyst
And my second question is on the Charge  part  So why only GBP700 million of improvement targeted because of where you have indicated on various aspects that you are looking at  there seems to be a much bigger opportunity under Charge  for F  21  So can you just highlight how and why only a particular number rather than a guidance of GBP700 plus million kind of a number 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Yeah  sure  Well  we re working on the basis that in almost all of that number next year would actually come from EBIT improvement  So we don t expect to significantly outperform investment and or inventory  We think we re at the levels where we need to be on those areas at this point in time  We will continue with them to ensure that the disciplines are enforced within the organization because all turnaround programs have to be sustainable  And they become sustainable by making sure that the people doing the day jobs do it for a living  and that s why they re mostly in the program  The rules that we have in place for those will stay but the level and scale of opportunity on those areas is much  much lower in FY  21  So it s overwhelmingly being targeted toward EBIT value generation  material cost reduction  And again  within three months  time  we re now a little bit more  and then three months after that  a little bit more than that  I can assure you if there s more value in those hills  then we will go get it 
Chirag Shah    Edelweiss Securities Ltd     Analyst
Yeah  And one last housekeeping question  if I can just ask  Is it that JLR has reported a negative tax for this quarter because your PAT number seems to be higher than PBT number  So if you can just explain and how should we look at going ahead 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
Okay  So we did actually get a catch up in the quarter for the recognition of the deferred tax asset  which hadn t been in place for the previous quarters  So I think it s probably better for us to look at the year to date data in terms of the normalized level of tax we should expect going forward  There s a one off catch up for the previous shipment  Of course  that s a good sign  right  That really is a good sign in terms of the growing confidence of the underlying physicals and the performance of the organization  But it s binaries one off  it s catch up for the first six months of the year as well as the quarter  Let me encourage you to look at the nine months rather than the quarter result in tax 
Chirag Shah    Edelweiss Securities Ltd     Analyst
And normalized is around 25  as the tax rate is the right number to look at around that reach or it s a lower number 
Adrian Mardell    Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover
It s a little bit lower than I would suggest  When you go through the detail of it  there s actually    there s more considerations and you d imagine  but broadly speaking  lower than 25   probably closer to 20  is a normalized    and if it s not at that level  something else it d likely happened  It really depends where we make our profits within a given quarter  of course

Adrian  would you want to pick that up or would you want me to pick it up  Happy to do that  Yeah  Right now we are number three in the market  And we sell about 5 000 odd cars in this market on JLR side  And it is a business that has been doing well  Just for your information  we just launched the Evoque today in India  And therefore  it s a business that we continue to invest  and we have our own manufacturing setup here  We also have our own engine manufacturing setup here  So it s an exciting market that we have out here  Having said that  this market as well has struggled in the last one year in terms of growth rate  similar to the rest of the passenger vehicle market  And the overall market size is about 40 000 odd vehicles and there it is  And it has not been dramatically growing  unlike what you would like to see in such  say  China  for instance  So that is a disappointment in terms of the potential market  But I think all OEMs  premium OEMs have a play here and are constantly focusing on this particular market  And we believe that we have done a pretty decent job in terms of almost 15 share is what we currently operate under and intend to continue to work our way and keep improving that

Okay  Thank you  Okay  And my second question is  as the shift is happening toward the electronic vehicle front  what is the    and Tata just launched the Nexon EV  what is the number the company is targeting 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
We don t give numbers in terms of the target for the line items that needed to be given it in the overall level  but it is more brokerage broader  the higher the market is what we want to do  But the potential of the market and how we are seeing it  let me probably hand it over to Shailesh 
Shailesh Chandra    President Electric Mobility Business and Corporate Strategy
Yeah  So if you really see Nexon EV  there are a lot of profit kinds  Personal segment EV product  which is the first time broadened at very close to what an IC counter part is  So far the references that we had in the past was product Ertiga EV or Mahindra eVerito  which was absolutely directed to a different segment  which is a key segment  Then you have cars  which were launched by a few other players  which were mainly CKD operations and were priced very high at INR25 lakh  And we know the demand references here  but absolutely  we have no clue in terms of what can be the potential of demand as far as this racial is concerned  although we have taken some reference of course 
But this is first    next two month is going to be a demand discovery phase for us  And then it will be clear what should be the potential of this product  But if I have to take any reference  for example  we would take the reference in the CV segment  which is Compact SUV segment  All those automatic transmission cars  which are being sold will be a volume reference  and we would like to certain share of that  That s how we are approaching this demand estimation  I would say 
But I think in the next two months  we ll be clear in terms of what will be the response  But so far  the bookings have been pretty strong  much more than what we had expected  And we ll be rather focusing on how to ensure that we are able to meet the demand  both on the supply side  Of course  we have one challenge definitely in front of us is the China situation  So that s the response to your question 
Nilanjan Gupta    Deerfield Capital    Analyst
Okay  Thanks a lot  All the best

Thank you  Ladies and gentlemen  we take the last question from the line of Prateek Poddar from Nippon India Mutual Fund  Please go ahead 
Prateek Poddar    Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited    Analyst
Yeah  Hi  Sir  just a couple of questions on the CV side  One is  could you just talk about these inquiries  which you are seeing  are they in the haul it segment or the tipper segment  That s question number one  Second is in terms of conversion  Are we also seeing similar conversion in the sense  increase in conversion rate  Or that is not happening  If not  why  And third would be  any thoughts on the scrapping  sir  These three questions 
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Girish  take that 
Girish Wagh    President Commercial Vehicles Business Unit
Right  So I think the inquiries that we are seeing are in both cargo as well as tipper and both are for different reasons  I think tippers now because there are a few projects which have started and payments have also started happening to some of the existing projects  and that s why the tipper demand has come back  But it is also an annual phenomena that post monsoon  and last year  monsoons actually got delayed  And I think once the monsoons were over  tipper inquiry started and that s what we saw as an upside  In terms of cargo  essentially  the inquiries are coming from the fleet owners  large fleet owners  medium fleet owners and essentially for replacement of their old BS III vehicles  which will give them better economic    it makes a lot of economic sense for them because the BSIV vehicles have better TCO as compared to BSIII  So that s where we are getting demand from    in the cargo segment  I think there is not much demand  which is coming from the retail segment and the retail segment is not as quiet as one has seen in the last fleet owner segment  which is essentially for replacement 
In terms of conversion  I think  as I said during our last call also that customers were waiting for trying to see if they can get better deals  but with the demand supply imbalance having changed now  essentially because of reduction in the stock  I think the realizations are also firming up and they are realizing  And we are also seeing the conversions happening during the month and not essentially during the later half or last week of the month  So this is what is the status  But I think overall volumes  in the sense  I think what we ve seen in the last quarter is November was a growth over October and December was further growth over November  So there was a sequential month over month growth in M HCV specifically  I think it will be key to see this particular month  But of course  this quarter is going to be a very unique one in the sense that toward the end of the quarter  we will see tapering or  in fact  reduction of retail  essentially because we may even run out of the stock  So that s where we are in terms of the commercial vehicles 
Prateek Poddar    Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited    Analyst
Okay  And sir  sorry  just if I may squeeze in one small question  and correct me if I m wrong  when we launched Harrier  Harrier did not have an automatic option  and we saw substantial bookings  I mean  cuts in the bookings  I mean  the bookings were withdrawn  This time also Altroz is launched without the automatic version  Any specific reason for that I m sorry  it s a very specific question  but you may choose   
P B  Balaji    Group Chief Financial Officer
Let it be specific and the answer is also going to be specific  As long as  the Harrier is concerned  I don t like to make any pre announcement to what is going to be the presented next week in the Auto Expo  But pleased to see  with us and we will actually see that  we ll deliver on our commitment that enhancement of the product is going to be part of an active lifecycle management of the products  So therefore  there will be a Harrier and we will actually see  that is Harrier actually takes all of the boxes in terms of the capital refresh raised at the point of the launch 
Second one  we needed  to Altroz  same commitment  There s an active lifecycle management  because of the concentration that we actually had to convert the entire range of product from previously BSIV  Now  as of the first of April  so we have actively launched on the 22nd of Jan  to BSVI  We had to actually strike a balance between our capacities for all of the required calibration activities to be performed  and what to launch in the first instance  as one of these balances to be taken  Altroz will actually seen its manual transmission at the launch  it follows shortly after by an automatic transmission in order to complete the product family and meeting the customers  expectations 
Why is it that we have taken this call  for the reason  we mentioned  But also for the reason  that in the segment  the Altroz is completing the current equipment of the option of an automatic transmission maybe CVT or DCT  as that the tendency of 12  to 16   where we said that s a reason that the percentage of option taken  which allows us to actually stretch the launch of the different variant over a couple of month
