Jill  Good afternoon  everyone  and happy new year  We finished 2019 strong with fourth quarter results that reflected solid demand for our product as homebuyers continue to prioritize choice and personalization in their home buying decisions  In addition  our performance under our returns focused growth plan produced measurable results  most notably in the year over year expansion of our housing gross profit margin  With the conclusion of the third year of this plan  there are several achievements to highlight  First  at roughly  270 million  our net income in 2019 is up by over 150  relative to 2016 when we launched the plan  This helped drive our return on equity to 12 2   nearly doubling its 2016 level to a point that was solidly within the plan s target range  Next  the significant cash from operations that we generated in the past three years enabled us to invest over  5 billion in land acquisition and development  as well as return  73 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  while also repaying about  850 million in debt  As a result  we worked our debt to capital ratio down considerably to 42 3  from 60 5   also achieving our tightened target goal  and reduced our interest incurred meaningfully  benefiting our gross margin  With the success of our plan  we are a larger  higher margin  more profitable and less leveraged company  Going forward  our strategy will remain consistent with a continued focus on profitably expanding our scale  while increasing returns  Specific to the quarter  we produced total revenues of  1 6 billion and diluted earnings per share of  1 31  Housing revenues were up 15  year over year  Despite falling a bit short of our anticipated range as some of our deliveries in the Bay Area were delayed due to the fires and power shutdowns  which impacted our ability to get utilities installed  Nonetheless  we leveraged the higher revenue base to meaningfully expand our operating income margin  which was up a full percentage point year over year to 10 7   excluding inventory related charges  This translated to an increase in profitability per unit of approximately 10   over  42 000 in operating income per home  The key driver of our operating margin growth was our robust gross margin  which we expanded 120 basis points as compared to the prior year to just shy of 20   We opened 23 new communities during the quarter  contributing to 9  growth in our average community count  In 2020  we continue to anticipate another step up in our average community count  with nearly all of the openings coming from higher margin core communities  The composition of our portfolio continues to strengthen  with core communities expected to represent more than 90  of our average count this year  From a macro perspective  mortgage interest rates remain low  continuing to support favorable market conditions characterized by steady economic expansion  solid job growth  high consumer confidence and positive demographic trends  While these factors fueled strong demand  supply continued to be insufficient to meet homebuyers  needs  with resale inventory declining of 3 7 months supply in November  and even lower at the affordable price points where we operate  In the quarter  our absorption pace accelerated to 3 7 monthly net orders per community  This was our highest fourth quarter pace in more than a decade  in spite of increasing prices in about 65  of our communities during the quarter  a seasonally significant level of pricing power  Taken together  our community count growth and increased absorption pace  as well as a soft comparison in last year s fourth quarter  all contributed to producing a 38  gain in our net orders  Net order value expanded by 43  in the fourth quarter to  1 1 billion  contributing to a 26  rise in our year end backlog value to  1 8 billion  In terms of units  our backlog grew to over 5 000 homes  our highest fourth quarter level in a number of years  We continue to strategically invest in land and position our product offerings to be attainable for the median household income in each submarket  As a result  we cater primarily to first time  as well as first move up buyers  In the fourth quarter  our delivery is the first time buyers rose to 56  of our total  the highest share of this segment that we have generated in many years  Our ability to increase our profitability at the lower first time buyer price points is both a core competency and competitive strength that has been the foundation of our more than six decades in homebuilding  We ve been consistent in our approach  and as housing markets continue their measured recovery fueled by first time buyer demand  we believe we are solidly positioned in the sweet spot of the market  While we continue to capitalize on this demand  underlying the progression in our financial metrics is a stronger and more efficient business  Our build times were down 12 days year over year in the fourth quarter  an 8  improvement to 131 days  Our implementation of our built to order model is highly efficient  as working from a large backlog of homes enables cost synergies and an even flow production process  We also like the flexibility that built to order provides  A year ago  as interest rates and home prices were rising  challenging affordability  we rotated lower in square footage  in most cases  using standard plans from our product series  We enhanced our product lineup  thereby expanding the choices available to buyers by offering smaller homes with similar livability and room count and reposition our model parks to reflect these changes where possible  While the subsequent fall in interest rates moderated affordability pressures  we believe we are well positioned for the future regardless of the rate environment  Moreover  we found that the steps we took were aligned with consumers  preferences as our square footage on built to order homes was down about 100 feet year over year in the fourth quarter  At the same time  our studio revenue per home was higher as buyers opted for less square footage without compromising the features they value  Our initiative was successful in widening our demand pool without sacrificing gross margin  In addition to the efficiency in our homebuilding operations  our mortgage banking joint venture  KBHS  continues to mature  with a capture rate growing sequentially throughout each quarter of 2019  ending at 74  in the fourth quarter  KBHS originated 70  of our homebuyers mortgages for the full year  As a result  our deliveries are more predictable with higher customer satisfaction  and the JV produced a 67  increase in income versus the prior year  We expect the capture rate to improve further in 2020  which should result in greater customer satisfaction and an increase in our JV income  With respect to the market updates  I will now highlight a couple of regions  beginning with the West Coast  This region continued to demonstrate momentum in the fourth quarter  producing a 54  increase in net orders with a positive comparison in FFD California division  Growth in both community count and absorption pace contributed to the region s results as market conditions were generally favorable across the state  Our Bay Area communities delivered a particularly robust comparison  reflecting in part to softness in the prior year s quarter  as well as our ongoing and intentional shift to more affordable price points  Looking ahead  we expect our West Coast region to further expand its community count in 2020  Our central region produced its highest fourth quarter net orders in more than a decade at over 1 000  a year over year increase of 41   Market conditions in Austin were especially strong  fueled by significant in migration in response to job growth and home price affordability  We opened five new communities in the second half of 2019 in our Austin division in premier locations  accessible to key employers  transportation routes and lifestyle amenities in the area  These openings contributed to the division s near doubling of its net orders year over year  One community in particular  Willow Trace  produced outstanding net order results at well above company average margins  The success of this community lies in providing an appealing product in the Prime North Austin tech corridor that is affordably priced with respect to the area s median household income in alignment with our company strategy  Of note  many of our buyers already rented in the area  and the opening of this community allowed them to remain in their preferred location  while now becoming homeowners  With an ASP in Austin of  295 000  we are competitively well positioned relative to the  315 000 median price of a resale home  Strong market conditions have continued in December and early January  sustaining solid demand for our products  While we typically provide an update on quarter to date net orders on this call  the comparison is skewed during this period due to the softer market conditions across our industry during the same period a year ago  As a result  we will instead provide our net order outlook for our first quarter of 2020  We believe a reasonable range is net order growth between 15  and 25  on community count growth of roughly 5   In closing  we ended 2019 strong and are off to a productive start in this new year  With a  1 8 billion backlog and an improving community mix  we are poised for double digit growth in our revenue this year  Also in anticipating higher profitability  we see further opportunity for expansion of our return on equity  which we expect to grow meaningfully in 2020  Given our favorable positioning and healthy market conditions  we are anticipating a solid year ahead  and we look forward to updating you as the year unfolds  With that  I ll now turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review  Jeff Jeff Kaminski    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Jeff  and good afternoon  everyone  I will now cover highlights of our financial and operational performance for the 2019 fourth quarter  as well as provide our outlook for the 2020 first quarter and full year  We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance  We generated improvements in virtually all of our key profitability measures and achieved solid absorptions and community count growth  which contributed to a significant year over year increase in backlog value  During the quarter  we also increased the borrowing capacity of our unsecured revolving credit facility and successfully refinanced our March 2020 senior note maturity  In the fourth quarter  our housing revenues were up 15  from a year ago to  1 5 billion due to a 16  increase in homes delivered  that was partially offset by a slight decline in the overall average selling price  Looking to the 2020 first quarter  we expect to generate housing revenues in the range of  910 million to  970 million  up 18  at the midpoint over the same period of 2019  For the 2020 full year  we still anticipate housing revenues in the range of  4 9 billion to  5 3 billion  Having ended our 2019 fiscal year with a backlog value of approximately  1 8 billion  up 26  from a year ago  we believe we are well positioned to achieve these expectations  In the fourth quarter  our overall average selling price of homes delivered declined slightly to  392 500  primarily due to a shift in mix in our West Coast region toward lower priced communities within our Bay Area operations  For the 2020 first quarter  we are projecting an overall average selling price of approximately  375 000  We believe our overall average selling price for the 2020 full year will be in the range of  380 000 to  400 000  Homebuilding operating income for the fourth quarter increased 33  to  162 5 million compared to  121 9 million for the year earlier quarter  including total inventory related charges of  4 1 million in the 2019 quarter and  9 1 million a year ago  Our homebuilding operating income margin was 10 5   up 140 basis points from the 2018 fourth quarter  Excluding inventory related charges from both periods  our operating margin was 10 7  for the current quarter and 9 7  for the year earlier quarter  For the 2020 first quarter  we anticipate our homebuilding operating income margin  excluding the impact of any inventory related charges  will be in the range of 4 9  to 5 3   up 80 basis points at the midpoint over the same period of the prior year  For the 2020 full year  we expect this metric to be in the range of 7 9  to 8 5   an improvement of 50 basis points at the midpoint over the prior year  Our 2019 fourth quarter housing gross profit margin improved 150 basis points to 19 6   including inventory related charges  Excluding the impact of these charges  our gross margin for the quarter increased by 120 basis points to 19 9  compared to 18 7  for the prior year quarter  This improvement reflected the continued reduction in our outstanding debt  along with growth in our unit deliveries  enabling us to further lower our incurred interest per delivery in the fourth quarter to under 3  of housing revenues  With the lower levels of prior period incurred interest and the widening value spread between our active inventory and total debt  we have measurably reduced our amortization of previously capitalized interest  which favorably impacted our housing gross profit margin by 90 basis points for the 2019 fourth quarter  In addition to the year over year improvement generated from the lower amortization of interest  our housing gross margin was favorably impacted by both our adoption of ASC 606 and the reduced headwind of deliveries from reactivated communities  partially offset by a mix shift of homes delivered from certain West Coast region communities with relatively high average selling prices and gross margins  Assuming no inventory related charges  we are forecasting a housing gross profit margin for the 2020 first quarter in a range of 17 8  to 18 2   up 40 basis points at the midpoint over the same period of the prior year  Compared to our fourth quarter results  this range reflects the anticipated seasonal first quarter decrease in operating leverage from lower revenues  We expect our 2020 full year gross margin  excluding inventory related charges  to be in the range of 18 7  to 19 3   an improvement of 30 basis points at the midpoint over the prior year  Our selling  general and administrative expense ratio of 9 1  for the fourth quarter was up 10 basis points from last year s fourth quarter ratio  mainly as a result of the unfavorable impact of the adoption of ASC 606  partly offset by improved operating leverage from higher housing revenues  We are forecasting our 2020 first quarter SG A expense ratio to be in the range of 12 7  to 13 1   as we continued to prioritize containment of overhead costs and expect to realize favorable leverage impacts from higher housing revenues in the current year period  We also anticipate that our 2020 full year SG A expense ratio will be in the range of 10 5  to 11 1   Our income tax expense of  41 8 million for the fourth quarter was essentially a noncash expense due to our deferred tax assets and represented an effective tax rate of approximately 25   Our deferred tax asset balance of  364 million at year end was down more than  77 million from the prior year  We currently expect our effective tax rate for the 2020 first quarter to be approximately 20   and for the full year to be approximately 23   Due to our remaining deferred tax assets  we anticipate that for both periods  this will continue to represent a noncash expense  In December  federal legislation was enacted  which  among other things  extended the availability of energy tax credits for building energy efficient homes through December 31  2020  Reflective of our industry leadership in sustainable homebuilding and energy efficiency  the extension of the tax credits will favorably impact our 2020 effective tax rate  The estimated favorable impacts from this recently enacted legislation is included in the first quarter and full year tax rate estimates  Including a charge for the early extinguishment of debt  our net income for the quarter was up 27  year over year to  123 million  and diluted earnings per share increased to  1 31  up 36  as compared to the year earlier quarter  This strong level of fourth quarter net income contributed to a 12 2  return on equity for the full year  We expect to realize an improvement in excess of 100 basis points in this metric in 2020  We ended the year with stockholders  equity of  2 38 billion as compared to  2 09 billion at the end of the prior year  and our book value per share increased by 11  to  26 60  Turning now to community count  Our fourth quarter average of 253 was up 9  from 232 in the corresponding 2018 quarter  primarily reflecting a 28  increase in our West Coast region  We ended the year with 251 communities  up 5  from a year ago  Of the 251 communities  25 communities  or 10   were previously classified as land held for future development compared to 34 or 14   at the end of 2018  On a year over year basis  we anticipate our 2020 first quarter average community count will be up in the mid single digit range  For the 2020 full year  we expect growth in our average community count in the low to mid single digit range  More importantly  in addition to this positive trajectory  we anticipate continued improvement in the quality of our community portfolio in 2020  We expect growth in our core community count to drive a lower percentage mix of communities previously classified as land held for future development  which we believe will provide a tailwind for future gross margin improvement  During the fourth quarter  to drive future community openings  we invested  399 million in land and land development  with  147 million or 37  of the total representing land acquisitions  Moving on to our balance sheet  There are several areas of continued improvement that clearly reflect the successful implementation of our returns focused growth plan in achieving our capital allocation and efficiency objectives  These include measurably growing our total inventory investment while reducing our inactive inventory  substantially deleveraging our capital structure  and meaningfully expanding the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  I will now cover these achievements in more detail  In 2019  we invested  1 6 billion in land acquisitions and development and generated  251 million of net operating cash flow  We also reduced our inactive inventory to  150 million at year end or just 4  of our total inventory  Starting this quarter  we have elected to include lots under contract with refundable deposits in our total lot count  As of year end  59  of the approximately 65 000 lots in our pipeline were owned and 41  were under contract  including about 9 200 lots under contract with refundable deposits  Our own lots at the end of the year represented about a 3 2 year supply based on homes delivered in 2019  During the quarter  we raised approximately  300 million from a public offering of 4 8  senior notes maturing in 2029  and used the net proceeds  along with available cash  to retire all  350 million of our 8  senior notes that were scheduled to mature on March 15  2020  This early extinguishment of debt resulted in a fourth quarter charge of  6 8 million  Due to the impacts of the lower interest rate and decreased amount of debt outstanding  the successful fourth quarter completion of these transactions will lower interest incurred in 2020 by nearly  14 million  In addition  these transactions extended the weighted average life of our senior notes from 2 2 to 4 9 years  Earlier in the year  we repaid all  230 million of convertible senior notes at the maturity in February  resulting in an 8 4 million reduction in our diluted share count and contributing to a reduction of more than  300 million and our total outstanding debt at year end as compared to the prior year  Our deleveraging activities over the past 12 months  combined with the increase in our equity from strong 2019 earnings  drove a 740 basis point improvement in our year end debt to capital ratio to 42 3   We expect further improvement resulting from stockholders  equity accretion in 2020 and forecast our debt to capital ratio to be below 40  by the end of the year  During the quarter  as part of our efforts to improve our capital efficiency and enhance liquidity  we completed an amendment to our unsecured revolving credit facility  increasing its borrowing capacity to  800 million from  500 million  and extending its maturity by more than two years to October 2023  We ended the year with  454 million of cash  and total liquidity of over  1 2 billion  including availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility  We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolver at the end of the year  In 2020  we plan to further execute on the principles of our returns focused growth strategy  Our priorities remain expanding our revenues within our served markets  improving our operating margin  monetizing our deferred tax assets  reducing our leverage  increasing returns and enhancing long term stockholder value  We will now take your questions  Please open the lines  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman   Associates  Please proceed with your question Alan Ratner    Zelman and Associates    Analyst Hey  guys  Good afternoon  Congrats on another very strong quarter into the year  You know  I think  obviously  the order number  very impressive  We ve been seeing some big numbers recently out of the other builders as well  I m just curious  as we head here in the spring selling season  how does the supply side of the business seem right now  Just thinking about all the various things that have been constrained at various points in the cycle  labor  land  it doesn t seem like there s too much concern out there as far as an ability to get these homes built and delivered and kind of maintain a strong absorption pace for 2020  But I m just curious what you guys are seeing on the ground related to all of those various inputs Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Alan  a few things  We already own and control all the lots for 2020  And we re very deep into  21 and working on that  As Jeff just guided  we expect revenue growth this year  So we own the lots to support a nice growth trajectory in  20  and we re working on  21  In terms of input cost  the land is    it s tight out there  but it s rational  And we re able to invest just like we did in the fourth quarter to support our goals  On the direct side  it s pretty flat right now for us  Lumber came way down  labor is fairly rational  We re working on growing our scale in our markets to retain all the great relationships we have with our trade partners on the ground  So direct cost  flat  Land s tight  but we re finding it  And we re pretty comfortable with being able to support our growth goals Alan Ratner    Zelman and Associates    Analyst Great  That s really good to hear and helpful  Second  thank you for providing the order guide for 1Q  Obviously  that helps with the modeling off of a tough comp period from a year ago  As you move past the first quarter and just thinking about the interplay between community count and absorption right now  right now  it seems like everything is kind of clicking on all cylinders  You ve got margin lift  you ve got absorption growth  But how much from here is it reasonable to expect your ability to drive absorption higher  I mean  right now  you guys are probably the highest in the industry from an absolute standpoint  So is there an expectation that maybe absorptions flatline a little bit once you get past the easy comps and maybe more of the upside might be on price and margin  Or should I think about that more even in terms of where that upside might come from if the market stays strong Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Good question  and it s one we spend time on every week in here  Alan  As we shared in our comments  our fourth quarter pace was the highest we ve seen for fourth quarter in over a decade  So sales pace is strong and demand is strong  We continue to toggle it in every community every week  where we re optimizing the pace versus the price to get the highest return on the asset  It wouldn t surprise me if sales ticked up incrementally because of the strong market conditions  but our focus is going to be more on getting margin as opposed to pushing a higher sales pace in the short run until we get to our margin goals  If we get to our margin goals  then you d see us go back for more pace  But for now  it d be hold rate to maybe go up a little and focus more on lifting our margins OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo  Please proceed with your question Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Good evening  guys  Nice results  First  just wanted to talk about your capital structure and the potential tailwinds of the lower interest expense  Your net debt to total capital has declined nicely in the past couple of years  it s a net kind of 35   How do you think about your correct capital structure going into kind of 2020  2021  Any chance that you actually work that down kind of below 30  Jeff Kaminski    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well  we have a target out there relating to our gross debt to capital of 35  to 45   And I would say that the target remains relevant for us and something we re focused on  But we had forecasted at the end of the third quarter that we d be down within that range by the end of this year  which we have accomplished  We do believe that we ll be able to be below 40  by the end of 2020  and comfortably within that range  And I d say our capital priorities remain the same as they have been  With the only slight difference is  in 2020  we believe more of that improvement on the leverage ratio will come from equity accretion as opposed to debt reduction  But we re really focused on growing the business and reinvesting in the business as a primary use of capital  we ll continue to maintain our now higher level of dividend  And we ll opportunistically work that leverage ratios  we have chances to do so Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  OK  And then a couple of questions on California  you know  very strong demand  But have you actually seen the higher price point coastal areas really start to heal or improve at all  And then California s 2020 solar mandate  could you give us an update on that  Whether you ll eat some of the cost  and it possibly impacts margins  do you see this possibly stalling the construction cycle  given potential installation labor constraints  Anything you can really discuss about the solar initiative Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Truman  first on the markets  We re seeing a minor improvement  I ll say  at the higher price points along the coast  The lower price points are showing strong demand  higher up to get in price the softer it gets  it s better than it was in the fall  but it s still not back  If you go to the OC  houses in  2 5 million   3 million are still a little soft out there  But overall  there are more affordable price points  The demand is very strong right now in the state  which is in part why we rotate it down again in our product positioning to cater to where the demand is  Relative to solar  it s a good question  It s still playing out  and the industry is trying to get its arms around it  As a company  I m not sure if this group is aware of it  but we ve been the largest provider of solar homes in the state  We ve now delivered over 10 000 solar homes  So we get it and we know how to do it  And there s a different story in every community  In some communities were grandfathered  other communities  we have permits we ve already have in place to avoid the solar mandate  Where you get past the    those types of nuances  though  the consumer has a choice  You can either lease the system or we can include it in the price order of magnitude if they lease it  the payment is around  50 a month  It s not a crazy number  You can t say with certainty it s not going to affect demand in some way  because it is  50 you could otherwise put toward a house payment  But as we get our arms around it  we think it s more of an incremental thing than some significant shift in demand or supply out there  No concerns right now on our ability to install the solar  because we ve been doing it for so long  and we have great partners out there OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI  Please proceed with your question Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    Analyst Thanks very much  guys  And again  let me add my congratulations for the quarter  I wanted to ask you about the land spend in the quarter if I could  This quarter  your land spend was pretty modest  and your yearly spend declined  I believe  on a year over year basis  And so I was curious as to  given the growth outlook that you ve laid out for 2020  what kind of land spend do you think we should expect in 2020  Do you think you could see yet another decline  Or do you think that you re going to see    in order to sort of maintain the growth that you ve outlined here  you re going to need to see your land spend pick up in dollars Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Stephen  the good news is we have the dry powder to do whatever we want to pursue our growth  We were down a little bit in  19 versus  18  But if you get into the numbers  that down can be one or two deals in California  It s not a broad based decline in land spend  And some of it is timing  some of it is structure  We re working toward controlling more  owning less  That influenced the number a little bit  but our plan right now and our hope is that for  20  we d spend more than we did in  19  because we want to fuel a growth trajectory  And that s the way our plan is laid out right now Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    Analyst Got it  OK  That s helpful  And last quarter  I believe you said two things  and I wanted to sort of see whether or not your thoughts had changed  or if things have changed at all in the last three months  Last quarter  I believe you said you raised prices in 90  of your communities  How did that look this quarter  And then I think you also mentioned that you really weren t interested in the build to rent model  And that s one of those themes that seems to be continuing to attract a lot of folks  So curious to see whether or not your thoughts have evolved there Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Stephen  I shared in the prepared comments that we raised prices in about 65  of our communities  which  for a fourth quarter  is pretty good Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    Analyst Yes  Did you say 65  Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer It shows that there is power in the quarter  Yes  6 5 Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    Analyst OK  Got it Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer And then on the rent  our view right now is we re homebuilders  Anytime we ve analyzed this  we get a better return on the asset as a homebuilder than we would as a landlord  And until we get to a growth trajectory that we re struggling with  I think we ll stay focused on what we do well  It doesn t mean we don t look at it  There could be an opportunity if we have a multiproduct asset we want to acquire  where a portion of it could be for rent and we d figure it out  but it s not a primary initiative for us at this time OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Mike Dahl    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Thanks for taking my questions  I had a two part question related to gross margins first  And Jeff K   just on the amortized interest and also the percentage of deliveries expected from reactivated communities in  20 versus  19  could you provide us an update on how you re looking at those two metrics with respect to the 2020 numbers Jeff Kaminski    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure  Mike  We believe both of those will remain tailwinds to our gross margin next year  perhaps at a slightly reduced level  I mean  in 2019  we had 90 basis points of improvement coming from interest amortization  I do believe it will be less than that next year  And the same thing with the reactivated headwind that should reduce  but probably not by as much as what we ve been seeing in    for example  in the fourth quarter  we were down 50 basis points year over year in the reactivated  but we re kind of getting to the end of the story on that  I think we still have some upside coming from continuing to sell out and close out those communities  But there s probably less opportunity  But still  both nice tailwinds for us on gross margin next year  both are included in our guidance metrics in addition to all the change in mix  etc   in our community portfolio for next year  And I think more good news to come from both those areas Mike Dahl    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst OK  That s helpful  And then the second question is then related as well  which is those seem to be tailwinds and your margin guidance  the midpoint is up 30 basis points  With those as tailwinds on the market conditions that you re speaking to  it seems like that s a kind of conservative number to be up 30 basis points at the midpoint on gross margins  So maybe you could give us some of the other puts and takes that you re thinking about  whether it s mix related or labor inflation or directs  Any additional color would be helpful Jeff Kaminski    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure  The largest impact and largest factor for us in 2020 would just be the community mix change  We closed over 100 communities out in 2019  It was over 40  of our beginning community count  So the community portfolio is quite a bit different as we go into next year  We re trying to forecast gross margins coming off those communities  many of which have not been opened yet  So we have a lot of openings to occur still in the first half of 2020 that will generate revenues and margins in the back half of the year  so we re trying to do the best job we can anticipating and forecasting where those margins will be  At this point  we have pretty good visibility  as I think most people are aware  with our large backlog to the first half of the year  and very critical spring selling season that s coming up  where we ll be refining our estimates and expectations for the full year  And speaking of the spring  I mean  we re pretty excited about it  We think we re really well positioned as a company  probably best positioning we ve had in quite some time relative to the market  And combined with very strong market conditions right now  we re really optimistic about the spring  And we ll be updating those gross margin metrics and expectations as we go through the year  like we always do every quarter  But right now  right at the midpoint  we re at about 19  for the year up  and our operating margins were up about 50 basis points year over year at the midpoint of our operating margin guidance  So pretty nice improvement on a base of right around  5 billion of top line revenue  So we re excited about what that will do to the bottom line OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays  Please proceed with your question Christina Chiu    Barclays    Analyst Hi  This is actually Christina Chiu on for Matt  My first question is just on your community count growth expectations for 2020  specifically geographically  Are there any markets or price points that you re specifically focused on in 2020 Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Well  what we re trying to do with community count is we try to grow the business throughout  We don t constrain our divisions  we don t constrain our regions at all with budgets and you can only spend so much on land  If they re hitting our hurdles  and they re bringing good land deals to the table  that s how we go forward with it  What we saw in 2019  which will impact 2020 revenues is we saw an outsize increase in our West Coast region with our community count growth  as well as our Southwest region  which has been a very strong market for us and a little more modest improvement  flattish actually  in central and a little more modest improvement in the southeast  So those factors will impact 2020 top line a lot more than what we do with the 2020 count  But as always  we re trying to focus on opening as many communities as we can that are hitting our hurdle rates  We re staying very disciplined on the hurdle rate side  We ll continue with the company s strategy of focus on first time and first move up buyers  It also happens to be really quite a bit of the strength of the markets in that area right now  so we re right in the sweet spot  and intend to continue to manage the business in that fashion Christina Chiu    Barclays    Analyst OK  Got it  And then can you quantify or maybe give a timing update of how you re expecting SG A leverage in 2020 in light of accelerating revenue growth and coupled with moderating community count growth Jeff Kaminski    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Right  Basically  on the SG A side  I mean  we always hit kind of a high point is a negative high SG A ratio in the first quarter as our revenues are typically lowest in the first quarter  and it progresses as we go through the year  usually hitting out a low point in the fourth quarter  and we expect pretty much the same trend that we ve seen in prior years in 2020 OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan  Please proceed with your question Michael Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst Yes  hi  Thanks  Thanks very much  I wanted to spend the first question just on the gross margin  just trying to dig in a little better and maybe kind of rephrase or ask around some of Mike s earlier questions in terms of fiscal  20 guidance  You had  as you said  90 bps of interest expense amortization improvement in  19  you expect further improvement in  20  although at a lesser rate  So even if it s half of that amount  you could still be looking at your core gross margins  excluding interest  flat to down a little bit  So I just want to understand why you would think that if    I think you kind of pointed earlier toward actually a continued improvement of mix of your communities from a gross margins standpoint  you re coming off of an easier comp  at least in the first half from perhaps higher incentives in the marketplace from the back half of 2018  And by contrast  also  I mean  you ve    and I think what people are just trying to understand is  is there s just a basic level of cushion or conservatism that you re baking in given your four quarters now averaging 50  60  70 bps higher gross margin than at least our estimates  and I m sure many on the street in terms of what you ve been able to beat  So just trying to    we re just trying to also reconcile and connect the dots or the drivers for next year Jeff Kaminski    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The basis of our guidance is really a roll up rate from the community level to the division level from the division level to the region and region of the company  So it s very much a detailed forecast  The mix impact is huge  Like I mentioned earlier  over 40  of our communities are changing on a year over year basis  You don t have the same communities that you re selling out of  You re dealing with things like land cost inflation and trying to offset that with some of the new land parcels  And we basically forecast based on what we know today  So we base our forecast on our backlog gross margins  as well as our selling gross margins and anticipating what those line gross margins would be later in the year  As I mentioned earlier  we re not even to this critical spring selling season yet  so we don t have anything on the books really for the third and fourth quarters  so it s all on paper right now  And it s our best estimate as we see it  And I think what s underappreciated generally by folks outside of the industry  are trying to    folks like you guys  trying to come up with your own guidance or your own estimates for companies  is the impact that mix can have  And how much community changeover can impact the numbers  and it s not just simple math of price up  costs down and the other  it s different store count in different stores  it s different markets and the mix has a big piece of it  So at this point in time  we re    that midpoint guidance number of 19  is kind of what we re seeing  We do believe  with the right market conditions in the spring  that we could potentially do better than that  That s why we have a range around it  And right now  we ll stick to the guidance numbers and update you as we go through the year Michael Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst Jeff  I appreciate that  And obviously  as you said  to your point  mix can be a pretty big driver in terms of variation  Maybe just flipping to this past fourth quarter in an effort maybe to better understand your guidance versus actual results  Your gross margin for the fourth quarter came in 40 bps above the high end of your guidance range  70 bps above the midpoint  So I m just curious if you had a sense of what drove that difference relative to your expectations or relative to the guidance range Jeff Kaminski    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The two largest items are really    we did a little bit better in the amortization than we thought  We were expecting something more similar to the third quarter  We were about 20 basis points ahead of the third quarter and our amortization    and really  one of the largest drivers was the reactivated headwind was much lower than it s been pretty much in for years  I think we picked up 50 basis points relative to the third quarter and reduced headwind from our reactivated communities  And that was a function of two things  One  revenues were a lower percentage of the total  but also  I think importantly  the reactivated communities actually had a pretty strong gross margin performance in the quarter and lifted the gross margins  As Jeff had mentioned  we increased prices in about two thirds of our communities during the quarter  but then the other thing that s usually outside of our guidance is we have a certain percentage of spec sales and deliveries within the quarter  which obviously don t start off in our backlog and we end up forecasting those  And to the extent you could take price in the quarter and you have to take less of a discount on our spec sales  that was also a positive  So those three factors are probably the main things behind the margin beat OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Susan Maklari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Thank you  Good afternoon  My first question is just on    you noted in your commentary that you ve seen buyers increase their spend in the design centers  even as the size of the home has come down modestly  I guess can you just give us a little more color on what you re seeing there  And maybe how you re thinking about that coming through  And especially maybe in the margin and then some of that mix as we think about 2020 Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Susan  understanding it  you d have to look at what each buyer is picking  One buyer will pick up higher level of upgrade cabinet  a different buyer will pick some more cabin option or debt option or a structural option  It really    when you look at the data  it really reinforces how personalized the homes are that we produce  because there are no two that are the same  What s interesting for me is the studio spend goes up while the home goes down  and a lot of the cost in the studio are tied to the size of the home  So it tells you that  even the buyer that was buying a larger home had the ability to put things in their house and chose not to  and with a little bit smaller home  apparently  they re choosing to put more in the studio  So we    and we price in the studio  it s accretive to margin to a degree  It s not a big lift to margin  It s just more revenue at our normalized margin  for the most part  So as we model  we have a margin analysis per community that includes studio revenue based on our experience at that community or with that price point in that city  So it s all baked into our guidance  We don t    we don t look to the studio right now as another upside for the year  It s just part of the ASP and the revenue that we guided Susan Maklari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Sure  I was just trying to get a sense of  are you seeing more of a lift as the size of the house has shrunk  And should    is that something that generally could kind of continue as you get this move to more smaller homes Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer It could  It could  I bet  Literally  and you ve been to our studios  every buyer is different than    some want a big home with nothing in it  and others want a smaller home and load everything in it and everything in between  And that s a part of why we sell so well because we can cater to everybody OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW  Please proceed with your question  Our next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless  and he will be our final question  from Wedbush  Please proceed with your question Jay McCanless    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Good afternoon  Thank you for fitting me in  The first question I had  a small decline in orders in the southeast this quarter  Could you talk about what was going on there  Because that part of the world has had a pretty good run in the past few quarters in terms of order growth  Hello Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer No  no  We re looking at the notes  Jay  One of the things that happened last year  in the fourth quarter  we had acquired that builder in Jacksonville Landon and had a bunch of inventory that we sold through  So there was a spike in sales in Jacksonville that didn t replicate  because it s getting out of old product that we weren t going forward with  So that s probably some of it  The numbers aren t that big  Our business in the major cities is very good  The Orlando  Jacks  Tampa and Raleigh  we re seeing good demand in all of them  So I think it was just the timing of that acquisition Jay McCanless    Wedbush Securities    Analyst And then the other question I had  could you all quantify how many closings were pushed because of the fire  And I m sorry to hear that you were affected by the fire  but how many closings were pushed  And are those pushed closings having any impact on your assumptions for the 1Q  20 gross margin Jeff Mezger    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer No  it s a pretty modest impact  It was well under 100 units  but they re a high ASP  So it had a bit more of an impact on the revenues  But it wasn t terribly significant  And it held our full year revenues in about the same range as we were at  at the end of last quarter  So not a huge impact Operator Operator signoff  Duration  57 minutesCall

129534,351049,KBH,Lennar  KB Home Earnings Boosted by Falling Mortgage Rates,news," Bloomberg     Falling mortgage rates are giving a lift to U S  homebuilders just in time for the key spring selling season 
 Lennar  Corp  NYSE LEN   reported that orders jumped 24 percent to 10 463 in the quarter ended Feb  28  The company said order growth exceeded the high end of its guidance by 5 percent  But deliveries fell short because of weather issues  across the country   KB Home  NYSE KBH   which reported earnings after the market closed yesterday  had a slight drop in orders  which were still better than expected  Company executives said they plan to open 35 new communities in the second quarter 
Mortgage applications for home purchases jumped 4 percent from a year earlier  a sign that the spring season is off to a good start  according to data released today by the Mortgage Bankers Association 
 We continue to see choppiness   Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said in the earnings release   However  during the quarter  mortgage interest rates subsided and ultimately pulled back and home prices moderated  providing a catalyst for the new home market to correct itself  
U S  homebuilders have struggled since mortgage rates jumped last year  adding to an affordability crunch  Rates have since fallen  giving housing a boost  Both companies also cited slowing home price growth and a strong jobs market  KB Home also said it plans to offer more affordable options with smaller floor plans in some areas

DR Horton  NYSE DHI  said it expects revenue between  16 7 billion and  17 billion  below Capital IQ s consensus of  17 2 billion  sending its share price more than 4  lower  The shares had reached a 52 week high of  47 02 on Wednesday before falling back  They re still up 25  year to date 
D R  Horton reported earnings of  0 93 a share for the quarter on revenue of  4 13 billion  beating estimates from Investing com for earnings of  0 87 on revenue of  4 04 billion 
The above consensus report was supported by an uptick in the number of homes delivered in the quarter 
The company delivered 13 480 homes for the quarter  up 10  from a year earlier  Net sales for orders rose to 16 805 homes valued at  4 9 billion from 15 828 homes valued at  4 7 billion a year earlier and ahead of expectations for 16 695 homes 
D R  Horton said it expects to deliver between 55 000 homes and 56 000 homes in 2019  above Wedbush Securities  forecast for 54 000 homes 
Some on Wall Street  however  appear willing to give the homebuilder the benefit of the doubt 
 Unlike more diversified builders  DHI has a strong presence with affordable communities and a large land inventory   said CFRA  an independent research provider with a strong buy rating on the stock 
 As a conservative operator  we believe DHI will manage pace and price  and it has ample land to match the higher pace of demand for entry level homes

1  Trump to Address Immigration Tonight
With the partial government shutdown putting many economic indicators on hold  geopolitics is holding a bigger sway on the markets 
President Donald Trump will address the cause of that shutdown    a border wall showdown between him and the Democrats that control the House of Representatives    tonight from the Oval Office at 9 00 PM ET  02 00 GMT Wednesday  
Trump has floated the idea of declaring a national emergency to get funding and use the military to build a wall along the entirety of the U S  southern border 
Democratic leaders have said they won t budge on a project that is ineffective and expensive 
A move by Trump to declare a national emergency could bring about legal battles over presidential powers and eminent domain  but could also take away a key stumbling block to passing a budget and reopening the federal government

Steven Winberg  Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy at the U S  Department of Energy told reporters at the U S  delegation s hotel that talks  which began on Monday  had gone well 
 I confirm we re continuing tomorrow  yes   Winberg told reporters  declining to answer further questions 
The editor in chief of China s state run Global Times tabloid Hu Xijin said on Twitter earlier that negotiations would continue on Wednesday

The outlook for risk assets remained  quite bright in an environment of gradually stronger global growth   the bank said

Wedbush upgraded its rating on Lennar to outperform from neutral on expectations that the homebuilder would rid its income statement of a  lingering distraction  by selling Rialto to Stone Point Capital 
Lennar agreed to sell Rialto Management Business to investment funds managed by Stone Point Capital for  340 million in late October

What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick Stellar Performance  D R  Horton ended fiscal 2019 on a strong note  Earnings per share and revenues increased 13  and 9 4   respectively  from a year ago  Notably  with 56 975 homes closed in fiscal 2019  D R  Horton completed its 18th consecutive year as the largest homebuilder in the United States  In fiscal 2019  homes closed increased 10  year over year to 56 975 units and 9  in value to  16 9 billion  Additionally  homebuilding cash flow from operations was  1 4 billion  This solid performance is expected to continue in the quarters ahead  buoyed by rebounding U S  housing fundamentals Solid Underlying Housing Market Fundamentals  The U S  housing market started building up strength since the beginning of 2019  after a torrid second half 2018  Favorable mortgage rates and moderate home prices have been adding strength to D R  Horton and other homebuilders  The overall homebuilding industry remains positive owing to ongoing traffic trends that indicate higher inclination of buyers  thereby reflecting a slow but steady housing recovery  Notably  declining interest mortgage rates  lower construction costs  low unemployment and increasing wages are somewhat offsetting the other ongoing headwinds This positive momentum is evident from the company s homebuilding revenue growth of 10 2  year over year in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  Home closings increased 9  from the prior year quarter to 16 024 and 10  in value to  4 8 billion  Notably  value of net orders improved 16  year over year to  4 billion in the quarter Accretive Acquisitions   Increased Capital Investments in Land  D R  Horton is rapidly acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets  Over the past five years  through fiscal 2019   the company has invested approximately  1 billion on acquisitions Strong cash position and low debt capital ratio allowed it to make strategic land purchases even during the downturn  in turn giving it a significant competitive advantage  The company has selectively invested in attractively priced land and lots in the past few years  allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets  D R  Horton s well stocked supply of land  plots and homes provides it with a strong competitive position to meet the demand in the upcoming quarters  thereby boosting sales and home closings The company invested  3 7 billion in lots  land and development in fiscal 2019  almost on par with the year ago level of  3 8 billion  It has plans to boost investments to replenish its land and lot supply in 2020 for supporting revenue growth Solid Growth Prospects  D R  Horton has solid growth prospects  as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the current year of  4 61 per share  indicating 7 5  year over year growth  Meanwhile  the company s revenues are expected to increase 6 8  year over year in fiscal 2020  Moreover  its earnings and revenues are expected to increase 13 5  and 4 9  year over year  respectively  in fiscal 2021 Overall  the company constitutes a great pick in terms of growth investment  supported by a Growth Score of B Superior ROE  D R

129616,351131,KBH,4 Stocks To Buy On A Possible Fed Rate Cut In October  ,opinion,Market pundits mostly expect the Fed to trim rates yet again by a quarter point during its Oct 29 30 meeting  Slowdown in global economic growth  trade related concerns and a string of disappointing economic data are cited as the reasons for the Fed s expected dovish stance In such a scenario  utility  real estate  telecommunications and gold mining companies are poised to gain the most Dismal Global Growth OutlookThe IMF lowered its projections for 2019 GDP growth to 3  in October from 3 2  in July  according to the latest  published earlier this month  Global trade uncertainty was cited as the chief obstacle to global economic growth In fact  the report also points toward the fact that the ongoing U S  China trade war has led to direct costs  market turbulence  and decline in investment and reduced productivity because of disruptions in supply chain In addition  geopolitical tensions related to Brexit could possibly reduce economic activity and hinder a likely moderate recovery in emerging markets and the eurozone Disappointing Economic DataApart from the pessimistic view of IMF toward global growth  certain domestic economic data have also been anything but encouraging First  the U S  manufacturing sector  in September  with the U S  manufacturing purchasing managers  index from the Institute for Supply Management coming in at 47 8   This is the lowest reading since June 2009  In addition  new orders for manufactured durable goods in September also declined 1 1  to  248 2 billion  according to the  Second  consumers are also growing less confident about the economy  This was reflected in the Conference Board s Consumer Confidence   which declined in September  125 1  after suffering a slight contraction in August  134 2   U S  retail sales  also dropped for the first time in seven months  shedding 0 3  in September as households cut back their spending on building materials  motor vehicles  hobbies and online shopping September s drop in retail sales compelled economists to lower their third quarter consumer spending growth estimates to an about 2 5  annualized rate from 3   Finally   of new single   family houses also declined 0 7  in September from the revised August rate to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 701 000   of existing single family homes also declined 2 2  last month All these factors make the case stronger for a third rate cut by the central bank in 2019 Possibility of a Rate Cut in OctoberIn fact  the CME s tool  which indicates the probability of FOMC rate moves in the upcoming meetings  recently showed that about 93 5  of investors are now expecting another rate cut at the FOMC s meeting scheduled next week  This

Analyst Blog  4 Stocks to Buy on Possible Fed Rate Cut in OctoberMarket pundits mostly expect the Fed to trim rates yet again by a quarter point during its Oct 29 30 meeting  Slowdown in global economic growth  trade related concerns and a string of disappointing economic data are cited as the reasons for the Fed s expected dovish stance In such a scenario  utility  real estate  telecommunications and gold mining companies are poised to gain the most Dismal Global Growth OutlookThe IMF lowered its projections for 2019 GDP growth to 3  in October from 3 2  in July  according to the latest  published earlier this month  Global trade uncertainty was cited as the chief obstacle to global economic growth In fact  the report also points toward the fact that the ongoing U S  China trade war has led to direct costs  market turbulence  and decline in investment and reduced productivity because of disruptions in supply chain In addition  geopolitical tensions related to Brexit could possibly reduce economic activity and hinder a likely moderate recovery in emerging markets and the eurozone Disappointing Economic DataApart from the pessimistic view of IMF toward global growth  certain domestic economic data have also been anything but encouraging First  the U S  manufacturing sector  in September  with the U S  manufacturing purchasing managers  index from the Institute for Supply Management coming in at 47 8   This is the lowest reading since June 2009  In addition  new orders for manufactured durable goods in September also declined 1 1  to  248 2 billion  according to the  Second  consumers are also growing less confident about the economy  This was reflected in the Conference Board s Consumer Confidence   which declined in September  125 1  after suffering a slight contraction in August  134 2   U S  retail sales  also dropped for the first time in seven months  shedding 0 3  in September as households cut back their spending on building materials  motor vehicles  hobbies and online shopping September s drop in retail sales compelled economists to lower their third quarter consumer spending growth estimates to an about 2 5  annualized rate from 3   Finally   of new single family houses also declined 0 7  in September from the revised August rate to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 701 000   of existing single family homes also declined 2 2  last month All these factors make the case stronger for a third rate cut by the central bank in 2019 Possibility of a Rate Cut in OctoberIn fact  the CME s  tool  which indicates the probability of FOMC rate moves in the upcoming meetings  recently showed that about 93 5  of investors are now expecting another rate cut at the FOMC s meeting scheduled next week  This could put the Fed rate in the range of 1 50  to 1 75  Finally  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  also sees a 95  possibility of a quarter point reduction in Fed rates at the upcoming FOMC meeting  The bank largely cited

for firms raising  500 million or more   according to Dealogic  SDC is down another 27 7  since its closing price on day one of trading  September 12th   I believe that this substantial drop in value may have created a buying opportunity SmileDirectClub is the leading direct to consumer teeth aligner  95  market share   which allows users to treat mild to moderate crowded or crooked teeth without ever seeing an orthodontist  The process takes less than half of the time a traditional orthodontist would and only costs  1 895  a fraction of what the conventional orthodontic model charges  typically between  5 000 and  8 000  With only 40  of counties having access to orthodontists  this model is attractive because of its convenience  ease  price point  and proven results  So far  SDC has helped over 700 000 people across the Americas as well as Australia and the UK  This year analysts are projecting that the firm will acquire around 450 000 new customers The total addressable market  TAM  for SmileDirectClub is astronomical  with 85  of the world having malocclusion  misalignment of teeth  and less than 1  of them are being treated  The convenience and affordability of SDC s product offering positions the firm to penetrate the untapped market potential Smile Direct has seen an unprecedented amount of growth in the past two and a half years  The company demonstrated almost 200  year over year revenue growth in 2018  and the first 6 months of 2019 illustrated 113  year over year topline appreciation SDC has been experiencing expanding gross margins proving economies of scale  which is an excellent sign for a growing business  Marketing and sales are making up a majority of the company s costs  but that s par for the course of a fast growing company Right now  SDC is only trading at a forward P S of around 6x  which is quite reasonable due to its exceptional growth outlook  The analyst coverage of this stock is still quite light  and I believe the recent selloff is due to this product s controversial product offering Investors are concerned about potential legal action associated with an orthodontic product being dispensed without the individual actually seeing an orthodontist  This type of practice is becoming increasingly common  with virtual online doctors  appointments becoming a norm for convenience chasing Millennials   SDC s lock up period comes to an end on 3 10 2020  meaning that pre IPO shareholders will be able to sell out of their positions at this point  This could cause a short term price slide in March of next year SDC is trending down as we speak with a 15  price drop just today  Short sellers are going to get whiplash when the reversal begins  With this compelling business and analysts  buy rating  I expect to see a SDC rally very soon  Top banks are rating this stock as a buy with price targets representing more than double its current price This stock is a highly risky investment and wouldn t give it a significant allocation in your portfolio  SDC appears to be oversold  and I see a short and long term upside Other Recent IPOs to Watch CrowdStrike is an exceptionally promising security cloud stock  It s a proliferating company with a ton of growth priced in  but still some excellent opportunity for stockholder returns if you are willing to bear the risks involved  Its reoccurring revenue streams make it an attractive investment even at excessively high multiples  Analysts are rating this as a buy  and its recent dip could have created a good buying opportunity  The lock up period expiration is 12 09 2019 Online pet retailer Chewy has sold off over 25  since its first day of trading  though the stock is still up about 20  over its IPO price  The pet industry has been expanding as millennials need for a best friend deepens  Chewy s online presence and positioning caters exceptionally well to millennials who seem to order everything online  CHWY is trading at 1 9x  which is unusually low for a firm that is expecting north of 20  topline growth moving forward  The lock up period expiration is 12 11 2019 Take AwayThe IPO frenzy hasn t yielded investors the strongest returns this year  but that doesn t mean that these stocks  potential went down the drain  For some of these stocks  it means that valuations have ripened  and so has the upside potential

Despite the new flexibility from the home builders  the National Association of Realtors has not embraced a shift away from the mortgage interest deduction and could prove to be a powerful force if the group feels the tax proposals would eliminate home ownership incentives  A spokesman from the group did not return a request for comment ",2017-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/key-lobby-drops-demand-for-us-mortgage-interest-tax-deduction-536382,536382

129676,351191,KBH,Lennar  LEN  Set To Report Q3 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,"Lennar   NYSE LEN   is set to report third quarter earnings on Wednesday before the opening bell  The homebuilder giant s shares have gained 41 8  year to date  outpacing the broader construction service market s 35 7  rise  The company is coming off a second quarter where they reported better than expected financials with solid Y Y gains 
The manufacturing sector has contracted for the past two months in a row  and investors are looking to see how this might have affected the homebuilding industry  Let s take a closer look at Lennar and how they might come out of the gates in their third quarter report 
Overview and Q2 Recap 
Based in Miami  Florida and founded in 1954  Lennar is engaged in homebuilding and financial services  In February 2018  Lennar completed its merger with CalAtlantic and created the nation s largest homebuilder based on revenues  The merger made CalAtlantic a wholly owned subsidiary of Lennar  The company s reportable segments include  Homebuilding  Financial Services  Multifamily  and Other 
In Q2  Lennar reported a sales spike of 1 9  to  5 56 billion  and earnings jumped 38 3  to  1 30 per share  Both earnings and revenue surpassed our estimates by 15 04  and 8 76   respectively  The homebuilder sector brought in  5 2 billion while the multifamily segment reeled in  147 4 million for gains of 2 6  and 25 3   respectively  The financial services division fell 18 2  to  204 2 million 
Deliveries of homes rose 5  to 12 729 and new orders were up 1  to 14 518 homes  Lennar said more moderate price increases and lower interest rates were leading buyers back into the market after a pause in the second half of 2018 
Q3 Outlook 
Despite Lennar s strong top and bottom line reports  shares fell over 6  after the conference call the company held with investors  Company officials said that labor and land shortages are adding to costs and that tariffs are adding  500 to the cost of a new home  Macroeconomic headwinds have had investors jittery about the homebuilding sector  but the US housing market may be stronger than people think 
In August  sales of new U S  single family homes leapt 7 1   which was well above economists  estimates for growth of only 3 5   That placed the closely followed metric at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713 000 houses  New home sales in July were also revised to 666 000 units  up from a prior figure of 635 000 
It seems that the Fed s rate cuts in July and September have had a positive impact on the housing market  as the low interest rate field has made it easier to finance a home  The increase in single family homes can benefit not just Lennar but other industry peers as well like Toll Brothers   NYSE TOL   and KB Home   NYSE KBH   
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast Lennar s bottom line to slip 5 71  to  1 32 per share and for net sales to tumble 2 64  to  5 52 billion  The homebuilding division is projected to generate  5 16 billion and financial services is expected to come in at  212 million for respective declines of 2 3  and 10 3   The multifamily segment is anticipated to contribute  113 1 million for a 11 9  climb

129715,351230,KBH,KB Home To Post  KBH  Q3 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,KB Home   NYSE KBH   is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2019 results on Sep 25  after market close  In the last reported quarter  its earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30 8  and 9 3   respectively  Notably  the company topped earnings expectations in each of the trailing 14 quarters Although the bottom line witnessed a positive surprise trend over the last several quarters  the metric declined 22 5  and 10 5  year over year in the fiscal first and second quarters  respectively  Its top line also decreased 6 9  and 7 2  year over year in the fiscal first and second quarters  respectively  The company has been experiencing lower average selling price   ASP   of homes delivered  declining housing revenues and higher marketing expenses to support new community openings Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has declined 1 5  over the past 60 days to 65 cents  This indicates a decrease of 25 3  from the year ago earnings of 87 cents per share  Revenues are also expected to decline 4 5  from the prior year quarter to  1 17 billion KB Home Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayRevenues  Although the U S  market is gradually improving  ongoing housing market headwinds  especially affordability concerns  are still putting up hurdles for KB Home and other homebuilders  Owing to these uncertainties  declining orders and backlog trend  KB Home expects fiscal third quarter housing revenues to decline in the range of   1 1  1 18 billion from  1 22 billion reported in the year ago period  ASP is anticipated within  395 000  400 000  indicating a decrease from the prior year figure of  408 200 Nonetheless  KB Home expects to boost average community count over the next two quarters  Favorable market dynamics   comprising declining mortgage rates  steady economic growth  high consumer confidence and favorable demographics   will help it grow further The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s homebuilding revenues  representing 99 7  of total revenues    including housing and land   is pegged at  1 167 million  suggesting a decline from  1 222 million reported in the year ago period Margins  Rising labor costs and land prices are likely to threaten KB Home s margins in the to be reported quarter  The company expects fiscal third quarter housing gross margin in the range of 17 9 18 5   assuming no inventory related charges   Considering the mid point of the guided range  the estimated figure indicates a decrease from the year ago figure of 23 1   However  the same suggests an increase of 100 basis points from fiscal second quarter gross margin of 17 2  SG A expenses  as a percentage of housing revenues  are expected in the range of 11 3 11 9  compared with 9 4  reported a year ago  This is indicative of the impact of lower revenues  additional marketing expenses and the ASC 606 reclassification Although KB Home s Built to Order approach and Returns Focused Growth Plan will provide considerable support to the bottom line  lower revenues and margins  along with higher SG A expenses will have a negative impact on the to be reported quarter Homebuilding operating margin  excluding the impact of any inventory related charges  in the to be reported quarter is expected between 6 4  and 7   implying a significant fall from 9 3  registered in the prior year period What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that KB Home is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for KB Home is  0 38   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  It currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s  0 38  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies in the Zacks  sector  which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarters to be reported M D C  Holdings  Inc    NYSE MDC   has an Earnings ESP of  8 95  and a Zacks Rank  1 PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM   has an Earnings ESP of  6 96  and holds a Zacks Rank  3 Masco Corporation   NYSE MAS   has an Earnings ESP of  0 35  and a

million in revenues  up from  2 3 million a year ago   housing revenues totaled  1 152 6 million  declining from  1 219 6 million   The decrease in housing revenues mainly stemmed from a decline in

129727,351242,KBH,U S  existing home sales at one year high  prices up,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  home resales raced to a one year high in September  the latest indication the housing market recovery is gradually getting back on track 
A separate report on Tuesday showed service sector activity in the nation s mid Atlantic region picked up speed this month  another signal suggesting underlying strength in the economy 
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 2 4 percent to an annual rate of 5 17 million units  the strongest reading since September of last year 
That was above economists  expectations for a rise to a 5 10 million unit pace and more than reversed August s decline  which had pushed down sales to a 5 05 million unit pace  Still  sales were 1 7 percent below those for September of last year 
 The housing recovery continues to move along sluggishly  as consumers are stuck between tight credit standards and limited wage growth   said Sophia Kearney Lederman  an economist at FTN Financial in New York 
Housing is slowly regaining its footing after activity stalled in the second half of 2013 following a run up in mortgage rates  While it continues to be hobbled by sluggish wage growth  a recent decline in mortgage rates should help support sales 
The 30 year mortgage rate fell to an average of 3 97 percent last week from 4 12 percent in the week ended Oct  9  according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac  The decline reflected a sharp drop in U S  Treasury debt yields as traders pushed back expectations for the first interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve against a backdrop of troubling economic news from overseas and a big sell off in global stock markets 
FIRST TIME BUYERS SIDELINED
The housing data helped U S  stocks to extend gains  The housing sector index  HGX  rose 1 3 percent  with shares of homebuilder Pulte Group  N PHM  gaining 2 18 percent and those of KB Home  N KBH  increasing 2 45 percent 
Prices for U S  Treasury debt fell  while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies 
In a separate report  the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its gauge of non manufacturing activity in the mid Atlantic region rose to 44 1 in October from 35 7 in September 
Measures of new orders and sales both increased  but a reading on service sector jobs slipped  suggesting a slower pace of improvement in the labor market 
While home sales picked up last month  first time buyers  a critical component for a sustainable recovery  remained on the sidelines  They accounted for 29 percent of sales for a third straight month  below the 40 percent to 45 percent that is considered ideal by economists and real estate agents 
 We need to see more first time buyers both willing and able to buy  without the support of excessively easy credit  if we really want to see a healthier and more sustained recovery in housing   said Diane Swonk  chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago 
Investors  who had supported the market  have been withdrawing  They accounted for only 14 percent of transactions last month  down from 19 percent in September of last year 
The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 6 percent from a year ago to 2 30 million  At September s sales pace  it would take 5 3 months to clear houses from the market  down from 5 5  months in August  A six months  supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand 

With supply improving  house price gains continue to moderate  The median home price rose 5 6 percent in September from a year ago  but that was down from the double digit growth seen for much of 2013

129773,351288,KBH,What s Driving Housing ETFs Despite Subdued Sales ,opinion,"Sales of new single family houses in the United States grew 7  from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 646 thousand in June 2019  after two successive months of a decline compared to market expectations of a 6  rise  But sales for the prior three months were   While overall sales saw a spurt in June  almost  from the West  where sales skyrocketed 50 4   Lower mortgage rates contributed to the housing sector 
However  this upbeat data point is of little respite as existing home sales make up the major chunk  about 90   of the U S  housing market  U S  existing home sales declined more than expected in June as a supply crunch pushed prices to a record high 
Sales of previously owned houses in the United States fell 1 7  from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 27 million in June 2019  compared to May s 2 9  increase and market expectations of a 0 2  decline  The median house price shot up to an all time high of  285 700 in June from  278 200 in May and  277 700 a year earlier  read    
Despite a sluggish sales scenario  housing ETFs like iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   WA ITB   and SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  have been rising of late  Both funds have added about 28  this year  better than the S P 500 s 20 5  advancement  In the past three months  XHB s  3 5   return topped that of the S P 500  3 2   
Let s take a look what is driving housing ETFs in recent trading 
Upbeat Earnings 
PulteGroup Inc    NYSE PHM    in itssecond quarter 2019 earnings release this week  reported a top and bottom line beat  The company is confident about upbeat housing demand for the remainder of 2019  given the recent declines in mortgage rates  and improving economic  employment and demographic trends 
Earnings per share came in at 86 cents  beating the consensus mark of 82 cents by 4 9   The bottom line  however  declined 3 4  from the year ago level  Total revenues of  2 49 billion outpaced the consensus mark of  2 48 billion by 0 5  but dropped 3 4  from the year ago figure of  2 57 billion 
NVR Inc    NYSE NVR   reported second quarter 2019 results  wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues from the homebuilding segment were almost flat year over year at  1 76 billion  New orders also increased 6  from the prior year quarter to 5 239 units 
In late June  KB Home   NYSE KBH   reported quarterly earnings of 51 cents per share  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents by 30 8  but down 10 5  from 57 cents a year ago  Total revenues of  1 021 8 million surpassed the consensus mark of  935 million by 9 3  
Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   also reported second quarter results in late June  The company reported quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share  surpassing the consensus mark of  1 13 by 15   Also  the reported figure jumped an impressive 38 3  from 94 cents reported a year ago  Revenues of  5 56 billion topped the consensus estimate of  5 12 billion by 8 8   The reported figure also increased 1 9  year over year 
Bets on Fed Rate Cut 
The Fed will in all probability cut rates by about 25 bps in its July meeting  The U S  central bank hasn t enacted any rate hikes this year so far  unlike 2018  This has resulted in lower mortgage rates  which in turn is benefiting housing ETFs 
Investors should also note that homebuilding stocks come from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 23   and a top ranked Zacks sector  top 25    It means that though there is substantial sales pressure  homebuilding companies are managing to stay afloat

129774,351289,KBH,5 Stocks That Boast Of Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment

That Boast Impressive Interest Coverage RatiosWe often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research

129776,351291,KBH, Housing ETFs To Buy On D R  Horton Beat   Likely Fed Rate Cut,opinion,"D R  Horton  DHI   one of the biggest and well known homebuilders in the nation  came up with upbeat third quarter fiscal 2019 results  Earnings came in at  1 26 per share in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 by 18 9   The reported figure also increased 7  from the year ago profit level of  1 18  Total revenues  Homebuilding  Forestar and Financial Services  came in at  4 91 billion  up 10 6  year over year  The reported figure also topped the consensus mark of  4 51 billion 
The stock gained 5 7  in the key trading session on Jul 30  reflecting the earnings results   However  net sales orders rose 6  to 15 588 homes   of 15 724  while the value of orders grew 8  to  4 7 billion to meet expectations  as quoted on MarketWatch  Shares of DHI fell 1 9  after hours 
Weak sales scenario is not new for homebuilding industry  U S  existing home sales  which make up the major chunk  about 90   of the U S  housing market  declined more than expected in June as a supply crunch pushed prices to a record high  However  subdued sales data did not stop housing stocks and ETFs from soaring this year  SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  is up 29  this year 
What s Making This Rally Possible  
The Fed will in all probability cut rates by about 25 bps in its July meeting  The U S  central bank hasn t enacted any rate hike so far this year  unlike in 2018  This has resulted in lower mortgage rates  which in turn is benefiting housing ETFs  read    
Earnings have been pretty good in the sector  Apart from D R  Horton  PulteGroup Inc    NYSE PHM    NVR Inc    NYSE NVR    KB Home   NYSE KBH    Meritage Homes   NYSE MTH   and Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   have also reported better than expected results in recent times In the past month  as of Jul 30  2019   KBH  LEN  PHM and MTH added 5 9   0 1   1 5  and 23 3   Also  DHI stock returned about 7 9  
Investors should also note that homebuilding stocks come from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 12    It means that though there is substantial sales pressure  homebuilding companies are managing to stay afloat  read    
Market   ETF Impact
The subtle bullishness over such an important homebuilding stock  D R  Horton  caused an uptick in housing ETFs on Jul 30  The ongoing Fed meeting and heightened speculation of a rate cut this month also added to the optimism   The fund XHB added 0 4  after hours on Jul 30  iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   WA ITB   gained about 2 2  on Jul 30 
DHI and LEN stocks take about 12 8  and 11 8  of the fund ITB  respectively  XHB follows a more spread out approach with no stock accounting for more than 4 95  of the portfolio  DHI takes 4 3  of the fund and gets a position in the top holdings 
In a nutshell  investors who want to bet on the Fed s dovishness and upbeat earnings  may easily take the ETF route for investing in the housing market  This is because a basket approach always safeguards investors from stock specific volatility

129780,351295,KBH,US STOCKS Wall St gains as M A offsets China s rate hike,news,"  Texas Instruments offers to buy National Semiconductor
   China hikes interest rates but impact may be muted
   Nasdaq OMX rebalances Nasdaq 100  Microsoft rallies
   Dow up 0 2 pct  S P up 0 3 pct  Nasdaq up 0 5 pct
  Updates to midday  changes byline 
 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  April 5  Reuters    U S  stocks advanced on
Tuesday as a large acquisition helped lift positive sentiment
and offset another rate hike in China 
 Texas Instruments late Monday offered to buy National
Semiconductor in a deal worth  6 5 billion  a premium of 78
percent  National Semi shares jumped 71 4 percent to  24 11 
Texas Instruments added 1 9 percent to  34 74 
 The deal is the latest in a string of multibillion dollar
deals that have helped pushed stocks higher in recent weeks 
The Dow closed at a new 2011 high on Monday  its highest level
since June 2008  though volume was the lowest of the year 
  These kinds of deals show that even with the rate hike
and the ISM number  prices are still extremely attractive  
said Tim Courtney  chief investment officer at Burns Advisory
Group in Oklahoma City   That s why the market is holding
steady despite some bad news  
 China s central bank increased interest rates on Tuesday
for the fourth time since October  raising suspicions that
data next week may show inflation rose more than expected in
March 
 In the latest snapshot of the U S  economy  the Institute
for Supply Management showed the vast U S  services sector
grew more slowly in March than it did in February  The pace of
March growth was slower than what economists had expected 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 25 96 points  or
0 21 percent  at 12 425 99  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
was up 4 24 points  or 0 32 percent  at 1 337 11  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was up 13 84 points  or 0 50 percent  at
2 803 01 
 Earlier  the Dow touched a fresh intraday high at
12 430 76 
 The S P 500 rose above 1 333  a closely watched level that
is double the low it reached in the financial crisis  It
hasn t ended above that level since mid February  and the
recent light volume has prompted questions over how much
enthusiasm there is to continue the rally 
 Apple Inc slid 0 4 percent to  339 90  off its session low
after the stock had its weighting cut in a rebalancing of
shares in the Nasdaq 100  The rebalancing  which takes effect
May 2  forced some to sell the iPhone maker s stock 
 Some companies had their weightings increased  including
Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  Microsoft s stock gained
1 7 percent to  25 99 and topped the Nasdaq s most active
list  Cisco s shares rose 1 1 percent to  17 25 
 Investors will scour the minutes from the latest meeting
of the Fed s policy setting committee  expected at 1800 GMT 
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said a recent rise in U S  inflation
was driven primarily by global commodity prices and was
unlikely to persist 
 KB Home shares dropped 2 7 percent to  11 87 after it
reported a first quarter loss that widened from the previous
year  hurt by a fall in net orders

though figures for the two preceding months were revised upward  These dismal readings for key housing indicators were largely attributed to trade related worries and rising costs of construction However  conditions are ripe for a rebound in the American housing market  For one  strict regulation has caused mortgage delinquencies to plunge to a 20 year low in April  Mortgage rates themselves have held onto record lowers  boosting the spirits of prospective homeowners On the flip side  tighter supplies are still working against buyers  But this is good news for sellers since a robust economy is likely to trigger bidding wars and price appreciation  tilting the market in their favor  This is why it is a great time to invest in stocks which stand to benefit from a rebound in housing Housing Market Distress Falls to 20 Year LowAccording to fresh data from real estate service provider CoreLogic  the so called foreclosure inventory rate slipped to a 20 year low of 3 6 in April  Considering that CoreLogic s data series starts from 1999  it could be the lowest for an even longer time span The reading clearly illustrates how strong regulatory control after the last housing crisis has created a lending environment which is nearly pristine  Some experts think that this is the precursor for another debacle  since things can only get worse from here  But there is a solid basis for these numbers According to CoreLogic   a 50 year low in unemployment  rising home prices and responsible underwriting  are the primary reasons for the plunge in mortgage delinquencies  The new mortgage environment is significantly better than the pre crisis era  where looser controls built a bubble of terrifying proportions Mortgage Rates Sticky at Long Term LowsAccording to Freddie Mac  the 30 year fixed rate mortgage clocked in at an average of 3 75  for the July 11 week  flat with a week ago  As we enter the second half of the year  this key housing metric has witnessed only eight weekly increases  The fact that rates remain at their lowest in nearly two years is likely to boost the spirits of prospective homebuyers Mortgage rates have remained nearly flat in recent weeks due to multiple factors  According to Freddie Mac s chief economist Sam Khater   modestly improving U S  economic data and a more accommodative tone from the Federal Reserve  are responsible for the stickiness in rates  With a rate cut later this month looking nearly certain  prospective homeowners will receive another shot in the arm Our ChoicesLast month s dismal readings for key indicators fail to predict the coming rebound in the housing market  Record low delinquencies and sticky mortgage rates indicate that the current situation is safe and favorable for prospect homeowners

129800,351315,KBH,US STOCKS Wall St advances on data  Bernanke news,news,"  Home prices  consumer data bolster recovery hopes
   Reappointment of Bernanke at Fed reassures investors
   Stocks up  Dow 0 56 pct  S P 0 4 pct  Nasdaq 0 4 pct
  Updates to late afternoon  changes byline 
 By Angela Moon
 NEW YORK  Aug 25  Reuters    U S  stocks advanced on
Tuesday as economic data and the reappointment of Federal
Reserve chief Ben Bernanke strengthened expectations for a
recovery and offset forecasts of federal budget red ink 
 Major indexes briefly hit 2009 highs after
stronger than expected readings on consumers and housing  two
crucial components for an economic rebound 
 But a drop in oil prices weighed on energy shares  and
Exxon Mobil helped limit gains on the Dow industrials 
 The Conference Board s index of consumer confidence in
August topped economists  forecast  while the S P Case Shiller
home price index rose for a second consecutive month in June 
 Home builders  shares rose  with Lennar Corp up 4 6 percent
at  15 24 and KB Home  also up 4 6 percent at  18 30 
  It suggests that there are  still more consumers and
investors yet to turn  or who are maybe increasingly turning 
positive  and that is helping to boost the markets   said Jeff

aggressive pricing 
 Procter   Gamble s shares rose 3 2 percent to  57 32  The
S P consumer staples index  up 1 1 percent  was among the S P
500 s best performing sectors

fairly consistently   said Fred Dickson  market strategist at
D A  Davidson   Co  in Lake Oswego  Oregon 
 The S P 500 is up 58 percent since hitting a 12 year

  Quadruple witching   the expiration and settlement of four
different types of September equity futures and options

event sometimes leads to increased volatility

 NEW YORK  Aug 25  Reuters    U S  stocks climbed  on
Tuesday  briefly hitting 2009 highs after strong housing and
consumer confidence data  while Ben Bernanke s renomination as
Fed chairman ended uncertainty about the central bank s
leadership as the economy recovers 
 Consumer confidence increased more than expected in
August  the Conference Board said  while the S P Case Shiller
home price index rose in June for a second straight month 
 A rebound in home prices and increased consumer spending
are considered crucial in order for the U S  economy to bounce
back from its worst recession in decades 
 Home builders  shares ranked among the top performers 
with Lennar Corp up 5 4 percent at  15 36 and KB Home up 5 2
percent at  18 41  The Dow Jones U S  Home Construction index
rose 4 5 percent 
  It suggests that there  are  still more consumers and
investors yet to turn or who are maybe increasingly turning
positive and that is helping to boost the markets   said Jeff
Kleintop  chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston 
 The consumer confidence data helped drive retail stocks
higher  Solid earnings from women s clothing retailer Chico s
FAS Inc  up 7 8 percent at  12 82  and close out retailer
Big Lots Inc  up 7 8 percent at  25 91  also bolstered that

 U S  President Barack Obama s renomination of Ben Bernanke
to a second term as Federal Reserve chairman reassured
investors  providing continuity when the economy is showing
signs of recovering from the recession 
  The alternatives were not good and the choice of Bernanke
is very deserved   said Hugh Johnson  chief investment officer
of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany  New York 
  To some  it was expected  But there is still a sense of
relief that it actually happened  
 In other economic news  official forecasts said the U S 
national debt will nearly double over the next 10 years  The
market s reaction was muted 
 The broad S P 500 index briefly hit a 10 month intraday
high  and remains on track for its sixth straight monthly
gain

crucial components for an economic rebound

  Bernanke has put his policies in place and now  with the
reappointment   the market is reassured that he will unwind the
policies in a timely manner  It s good to know that someone
else won t come in and change everything   said Kim Caughey 
senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in

 The positive news overshadowed government forecasts that

129849,351364,KBH,Chilly Winter Could Saw Into Home Builders  Q1 Results,opinion,"By most accounts  homebuilders didn t exactly get much hammer time in Q1 
The weather always a dubious affair for outside framing and brick laying at any time wasn t just unseasonably chilly this winter  it was downright nasty  The polar vortex hit and then created a ripple effect with extreme climate blasts throughout much of the country 
As some homebuilders and home improvement retailers start to roll out their Q1 earnings results  we might see the soft numbers in housing starts and residential building permits over the first months of the year coming home to roost as weak housing market trends persist 
Remember that housing starts tumbled 8 7  in February  and building permits were down 1 6  as well  according to the Commerce Department  On the positive side  new home sales did rise 4 5  in March  but that was with a 9 7  drop in the median price 
Unfortunately  we re not sure yet how accurate those February housing starts and building permit numbers were  The Commerce Department warned last month that the 35 day government shutdown beginning Dec  22 could have been a culprit behind soft numbers 
 Delays in data collection for December and January could make it more difficult to determine the exact start and completion dates   the Commerce Department said  That could lead to significant revisions that are yet to be seen  so hold tight 
Warmer weather appears to be just around the corner and many investors could be looking ahead at the start of the busiest time of the homebuilding  home improvement and home buying year  Warm weather  for example  tends to prompt homeowners to start thinking about repairing that fence that the snowplows knocked over or repainting the house  The question is what home building and supply industry executives might say about their perspectives on this activity 
The Mortgage Rate Catalyst
If mortgage rates are any indication  looking ahead might be a rosier picture than looking behind  judging from some analysts  housing market predictions  Mortgage rates bounced up a bit recently after four straight weeks of falling  but 30 year fixed rate mortgage rates are still a good 25 basis points below where they were a year ago  Lower rates often give potential home buyers a push to step up to the plate 
It might help  too  that it appears the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to get back to the business of upping rates any time soon  according to the minutes from its March meeting  Those minutes appeared to be helping mortgage rates stabilize a bit  Even with concerns surfacing about consumer spending and housing activity slowing  most Fed officials said during the meeting they didn t see it trickling into Q2 
 A majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year   according to the minutes 
Add then there s the Mortgage Bankers Association s outlook for spring that was recently released  The MBA reported that building applications rose 7  on a year over year basis in March  which marked a 19  gain over February 
 With a strong job market  rising wages and lower mortgage rates  housing demand remains strong  as shown by the solid 7  growth in new home purchase applications in March   Mike Fratantoni  MBA s Chief Economist  said in a statement 
 The confluence of declining mortgage rates with the spring buying season is supporting stronger housing demand and activity   he added   Additionally  the drop in average loan size suggests that builders are tilting production to lower priced homes  which continues to see the tightest inventories and strongest home price growth  
We need to consider taking a wait and see approach on the housing market forecast and let s never forget that borrowers and buyers are a rate sensitive bunch 
 Figure 1  BUILDERS  MARKET  After slumping in March as economic concerns grew and word came in of a chilly start to the year  homebuilder stocks  candlestick  got a wind at their back in April and are now keeping close pace with the S P 500 Index  purple line   Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Optimism Grows  But Not For Q1
Still  it might be worth noting that analysts like those at CFRA are sounding a little more positive about homebuilders  Rates could be a catalyst for higher demand with improved prospective homebuyer affordability  CFRA recently said in a research note 
That doesn t help the quarter that was  Revenues for Q1 are expected to show single digit declines compared with a year ago  CFRA said  And higher land prices  coupled with rising costs of labor and materials are expected to saw right into gross margins by a range of 50 100 basis points  the research firm predicted 
Some of the biggest home building companies saw strength in their stocks so far this year  through the end of last week   and that might partly reflect falling rates and the dovish Fed  KB Homes  KBH  has advanced nearly 36   Lennar  NYSE LEN  is up 35   Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  by 19  and DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI  almost 34   On the home improvement side of the equation  Home Depot  NYSE HD  has gained 19  and Lowe s  NYSE LOW  is tracking higher by 23  
KB Home  NYSE KBH  and  Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN  may have already set the tone  reporting their latest quarterly earnings late last month  Overall  they were better than the year ago period but mostly short of analyst expectations 
 We continued to see choppiness in the marketplace during our first quarter   Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said in a statement   However  during the quarter  mortgage interest rates subsided and ultimately pulled back and home prices moderated providing a catalyst for the new home market to correct itself

129851,351366,KBH,Home Depot  Lowes  And Housing Development  What To Expect,opinion,"Home Depot   NYSE HD    the world s largest home improvement retailer  released an earnings beat this morning with EPS outperforming estimates by 4 6  and illustrating year over year growth surpassing 9   Revenues marginally beat estimates and showed 5 7  growth from the same quarter last year 
HD has displayed consistently strong top and bottom line growth since the recession  showing 63 5  sales growth and tripling its income in 9 years  The stock has boomed in the last decade  exhibiting 966  returns for investors The Home Depot  Inc  Price and Consensus    
Home Depot and its biggest competitor Lowes   NYSE LOW   are both considered building production   home improvement retailers  This allows one to conclude that these two firms have a correlation with the housing market and new house developments  Below is a chart illustrating the number of new privately owned housing units since the 2008 recession  As you can see the increasing amount of housing units has the same strong positive growth that you see in HD above 
 
The weather has been an issue in housing and renovation projects over the past few months as conditions around the US have been wetter than usual  This April ranked in the top 10  wettest Aprils in the US taken from 125 years of data collected by the NOAA  This apparently didn t have a substantially adverse effect on Home Depot s earns  and we will see  when Lowes reports earnings tomorrow  if it had a material effect on its performance 
Housing Outlook 
Unemployment rates 50 year low  land shortages and bad weather have all inhibited construction this past quarter  Lumber futures have fallen 26  since their high in early February because of this surplus in lumber due to the limited construction 
Housing and construction are very cyclical and sensitive to economic activity  Homebuilders as a whole have been performing quite well in 2019 thus far though  With the Federal Reserve s dovish verbiage  interest rates have trailed down quite a bit in the past 6 months  This has led to an uptick in the housing market as potential homeowners want to ensure they lock in a low interest rate 
DR Horton   NYSE DHI   is one of America s large home developers  DHI is up 27 3  for 2019  more than doubling the S P 500s return YTD 
KB Home   NYSE KBH   was the first publicly traded home builder on the NYSE  It has seen even higher returns for investors  driving gains north of 41  YTD 
Home Depot Outlook 
The company is doubling down on its investment in tool rentals   We know that 90  of pros rent tools  but several years ago  only about one out of 10 pros rented from us   said Home Depot s CEO Craig Minear during today s earnings call  This investment is expected to continue to show substantial returns  The logic behind this is that the more professionals that rent tools from Home Depot the more they will purchase other needs their because why not  they are already there 
Professionals would make great reoccurring customers because they always need new construction supplies and building a more consistent customer base is going to drive profits much quicker  than relying on one time purchases from Dads attempting to fix the hinges on their cabinets or grabbing light bulbs 
Home Depot warned investors of a new impending lumber tariff on Chinese imports that could have up to a  1 billion effect 
Lowes Earnings Preview for Tomorrow  
Lowes is expected to report a Q1 EPS of 1 33  representing 11 7  year over year growth  It is expected to have sales growth of 1 5  from the same quarter last year  Bear in mind  all of the uphill battles that Home Depot faced this past quarter  such as limited construction and a 26  drop in lumber prices since February  could hit LOW much harder than it hit HD 
Take Away
Be cautious when investing in any of the firms I have mentioned above because of the sensitive and cyclical nature of them  The housing market is correlated with interest rates and economic conditions  With less land and labor available for housing development  stocks like DHI and KBH may take a hit if they don t efficiently use their resources 
Home Depot and Lowes have a bit more of a hedge than the housing development companies when it comes to interest rate changes and adverse economic conditions because people still need to fix broken sinks  change light bulbs  repaint chipped walls  etc  no matter how the economy is doing  They will still feel the economic pressures none the less though

129882,351397,KBH,Technically Speaking  Markets Remain Modestly Bearish,opinion,"Technically Speaking For March 27
Summary
The San Francisco Federal Reserve is predicting modest growth in the medium term due to slowing population growth 
The housing market is rebounding modestly 
The overall tone of the markets remains modestly bearish 
The San Francisco Federal Reserve is projecting a somewhat slower pace of growth in 2019  Most importantly  due to slower working age population growth  they are also predicting a slower pace of growth for the medium term  emphasis added  

Demographics are the most important reason to expect slow future growth relative to its historical pace  By the middle of the next decade  the working age population  16 to 64 year olds  will be growing at a historically low pace  reflecting the aging of the baby boom generation  Of course  the working age population does not translate one for one into employment  for example  many people over 64 do work  and participation trends are changing for other groups  Going forward  the Congressional Budget Office projects that the potential U S  labor force will grow at about a 0 5  pace  This is almost a percentage point below its average pace over the past half century 

Population and productivity growth form potential GDP  Both are growing slowly 
Homebuilding stocks are rebounding  On the latest earnings call  KB Home  NYSE KBH  said it is seeing a pick up in activity  other builders are seeing the same thing  There are strong fundamentals supporting this development  the unemployment rate is low  interest rates are coming down  despite some recent softness consumer sentiment is still at high levels  and home prices are starting to come down a bit  As a result  the homebuilding sector is rallying  which is clearly shown in the point and figure chart 

Theresa May has offered to step down as prime minister if Parliament passes the Brexit plan 


Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain told Conservative lawmakers on Wednesday that she would step down if Parliament approved her plan for withdrawal from the European Union 
 I have heard very clearly the mood of the parliamentary party   Mrs  May told the lawmakers   I know there is a desire for a new approach  and new leadership  in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations  and I won t stand in the way of that  

I have to wonder if anyone would be able to corral Parliament on this issue  It seems as though no one wants to make the hard decisions related to this separation of the countries  Still  the longer this is delayed the probability of a very messy no deal Brexit increases  which will send shock waves through the UK and EU economies 
Let s turn to today s performance table 

Even though the transports led the markets higher  this was really a Treasury market day  with the long end of the market providing the bulk of the moves higher  Meanwhile  equity indexes were off modestly 
Overall  I remain modestly bearish on the markets  As I noted yesterday  the riskier averages are moving modestly lower while the Treasury market is rallying  The bigger cap indexes are trading sideways  For this to change  we  at a minimum  need to see a stronger move from the IWM and IJH  While I d also like to see a Treasury market selloff to accompany an equity move higher  that s probably not going to happen 
None of that is happening right now  Let s start with charts from the two week time frame 

The IWM is trading in the lower half of its two week chart  Prices are below the 200 day EMA  as are the shorter EMAs 

The SPY is also in the lower half of its chart with prices below the 200 day EMA 

Meanwhile  the IEF is rallying  It consolidated between March 14 and March 20  It then started to move higher and has been in an uptrend for the last three and a half days 
We see the same situation in the 30 minute time frame 

The IWM is in the lower half of its 30 day chart  Prices are below the 200 day EMA 

The SPY is in a somewhat better position  Prices arced higher from March 11 19  But they ve been trending modestly lower since  Right now  prices are consolidated right around the 200 minute EMA 
Meanwhile  the IEF is in the middle of a rally 
Right now  my basic call is modestly bearish  The Treasury market rally and underperformance of the IWMs and IJHs indicate traders are modestly concerned about future growth  But the underlying fundamentals are still good  which should continue to support the markets

129887,351402,KBH,Should Value Investors Choose KB Home  KBH  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put KB Home   NYSE KBH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  KB Home has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 3  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 06  If we focus on the long term PE trend  KB Home  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 94 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Construction Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 16  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that KB Home has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 39  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  KB Home has a P S ratio of 0 54  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  KB Home currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes KB Home a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though KB Home might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of C  This gives KBH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one upward revision compared to five downward revisions in the past sixty days  whereas the full year estimate has seen three upward and fours downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 30 36  in the past two months  while the full year estimatedeclined by 1 50   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below KB Home Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performancefrom the company in the near term Bottom LineKB Home is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 13  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall Moreover  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
5 Homebuilder Stocks Likely to Gain in 2019
Housing stocks were dealt a blow by the release of dismal sectoral data on Feb 26  Home Depot s dismal fourth quarter numbers worsened matters  Consequently  the iShares Home Construction ETF and the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF each declined at least 0 6  
Incidentally  2018 was the most disastrous year in a decade for housing stocks  But homebuilders have executed a spectacular recovery this year with the ITB and the XHB rallying 17 7  and 19 4  year to date 
The primary catalyst for these gains is the Fed s new found dovishness  The steady pace of the housing recovery since 2008 and demographic factors are other positives working in favor  This means that homebuilders are likely to snap up substantial gains this year 
Dismal Data But With a Silver Lining
According to a Commerce Department report released on Tuesday  housing starts declined 11 2  last December  This marks the slowest rate of construction since September 2016  The metric has declined 10 2  in the last 10 months primarily due to prohibitively high home prices 
Meanwhile  the Case Shiller 20 city home price index increased 4 2  on a yearly basis in the same month  This again marks the slowest growth rate seen since November 2014 
But the drop in prices could end up addressing the current demand supply mismatch  Also  sector specialists think last year s pace of increases was unsustainable  At a time when economic data was dismal  prices increased at twice the pace of inflation  Such a situation is unlikely to persist 
Dovish Fed  Steady Recovery to Fuel Gains
Both the ITB and the XHB had their most dismal year since 2008 last year  A large part of these declines can be attributed to the four rate hikes undertaken by the Fed  This significantly tightened monetary conditions and momentarily thwarted a long running market rally 
However  in January  the Fed hinted that it was putting the process of rate hikes on hold  This bodes well for homebuyers since a rate hike significantly increases the cost of home mortgages  Also  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note has tracked lower this year  thanks to trade tensions and global slowdown concerns  This has also helped to step up applications for mortgages 
It comes as no surprise that several major homebuilder stocks have garnered significant gains year to date  Shares of D R  Horton  Inc   KB Home  Lennar Corp   PulteGroup  Inc  and Toll Brothers  Inc  have scooped up 17 1   21 5   26 3   5 6  and 13 2   respectively 
Demand Among Millennials to Enhance Long Term Prospects
Industry watchers think the long term prospects of housing remain bright because millennials are rapidly entering prime household formation age  Initially  reluctant to purchase homes  this class of buyers has rapidly changed their buying behavior 
This could result in a significant spurt in demand over the next five to 15 years  With a number of factors likely to power homebuilding stocks this year  it would prove profitable to watch this space closely at this time

129912,351427,KBH,KB Home  KBH  Gears Up For Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,KB Home   NYSE KBH   is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2019 results on Mar 26  after market close  In the last reported quarter  earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 2  but revenues lagged the same by 0 02   In fact  the company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing 12 quarters  with the average positive surprise being 13 8  In fiscal fourth quarter 2018  earnings increased 14  year over year on 4  lower revenues  primarily attributable to lower average selling price   ASP   of homes delivered How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised downward over the past 60 days to 26 cents per share  This reflects a decrease of 35  from the year ago earnings of 40 cents per share  Revenues are also expected to decline 4 8  from the prior year quarter to  829 9 million KB Home Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayRevenues  The company had a slower start to fiscal 2019  as net orders in the month of December were down 15  year over year  Notably  December is typically KB Home s slowest selling month  Meanwhile  ongoing housing market headwinds are expected to impact the company in the to be reported quarter  It generated unseasonably strong net order activity in the year ago quarter In the fiscal third quarter  the company s net order value of  738 million was down more than 21   impacted by a mix shift away from the West Coast and a geographic shift to the lower priced inland markets within this region  As a result  in the fiscal fourth quarter  KB Home s backlog was down 7  in units and backlog value of  1 4 billion decreased 14  year over year For the fiscal first quarter  the company expects housing revenues between  800 million and  860 million  down from  867 million reported in the year ago period   ASP in the to be reported quarter is anticipated within  375 000  385 000  below the prior year figure of  389 800  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s homebuilding revenues  comprising 99 7  of the total revenues   including housing and land  is pegged at  831 million compared with  1 344 million reported in the fiscal fourth quarter and  869 million in the year ago period Margins  KB Home expects housing gross margin for the fiscal first quarter in the range of 16 6 17 2   assuming no inventory related charges   compared with 16 7  a year ago  The company highlighted that the guidance reflects typical seasonal first quarter decrease in operating leverage owing to lower revenues  partially offset by reduced amortization of capitalized interest  This guidance also reflects the expected impact from the implementation of ASC 606  which will result in the reclassification of certain expenses previously included in construction and land cost to selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses SG A expenses  as a percentage of housing revenues  are expected in the range of 12 7 13 5  compared with 11  reported a year ago  This reflects the impact of lower revenues  additional marketing expenses and the ASC 606 reclassification mentioned earlier Although KB Home s Built to Order approach and Returns Focused Growth Plan will provide considerable support to the bottom line  lower revenues and margins  and higher SG A expenses will have a negative impact on the to be reported quarter What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not suggest that KB Home is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for KB Home is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 93 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  KB Home currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5 going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing

129929,351444,KBH,Strong Sales For LGI Homes Set Up Earnings Reports For Lennar And KB Home,opinion,"LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  released a strong sales report that granted investors in home builders a much needed sigh of relief  On January 7  2019  mislabeled as the 4th in the press release   LGIH announced 

 an all time record for home closings during a single month with 884 homes closed in December 2018  representing year over year growth of 14 8   In addition  the Company announced record breaking quarterly home closings of 1 852 during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 1 844 home closings in the fourth quarter of 2017  The Company had 6 512 home closings in 2018 surpassing its previous annual record of 5 845 home closings in 2017 by 11 4  

While the year over year fourth quarter gain in home closings was just 8 homes  it WAS a gain  Clearly there was a big rush to close home sales in December  These results were quite an accomplishment given the declining housing market data  and the records were impressive for the month of December  The market responded by sending LGIH higher by 14 4   The buying was strong enough to send the stock to a 4 month high and a bullish breakout above resistance at the 200 day moving average  DMA   Buyers tried to extended the momentum today but failed to prevent a fade to a flat close 

LGI Homes  LGIH  broke out above its 200DMA resistance and closed at a 4 month high 
In early December  I added shares in LGIH to my seasonal trade in home builders based on what I described as an apparent stabilization in several housing related stocks  LGIH was testing 50DMA support at the time  and my observations turned into a timely trade  In late December  I pointed out the resiliency in LGIH during a time when the rest of the stock market was suffering from the pressures of record December selling 
While I will continue to hold all my positions  I am warily watching for signs of renewed selling pressure in the sector  who knows what kind of housing data will be available this month given the grinding government shutdown   For example  according to CNBC s Fast Money  options players apparently rushed to bet against the upcoming earnings for home builders Lennar  NYSE LEN  and KB Home  NYSE KBH   LEN experienced 4x its average put volume and KBH experienced double  KBH was outright put buying whereas LEN was more of a hedged bet  perhaps a trader who has been following the recurring advice on this show to bottom fish in LEN since last Spring   

LEN reports earnings the morning of January 9th and is the first big earnings test for home builders in 2019  KBH follows LEN into the breach with an after hours earnings report  If the news is positive for LEN and or the reaction to LEN s report is positive  I will likely speculate on a positive post earnings response for KBH  KBH has bullish technicals with the recent 50DMA breakout and a quick test of the 50DMa as support  This action makes for the explosive post earnings potential of a breakout above resistance from recent highs 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  managed to close above its upper Bollinger  Band  BB  for the second straight day as it faces a critical test of resistance from previous highs 

Lennar  LEN  started the week with a 50DMA breakout that helped confirm the 2016 low as approximate support  
KB Home  KBH  broke out above 50DMA resistance last Friday and neatly tested the 50DMA as support at its intraday low  The stock is primed for a big burst higher if earnings cooperate

129940,351455,KBH,Tandem  MGM  Meritage  KB Home And Lennar Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 21  2019    Tandem Diabetes Care   NASDAQ TNDM   as the Bull of the Day  MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Meritage Homes Corp    NYSE MTH    KB Home   NYSE KBH   and Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Tandem Diabetes Careis a  2 7 billion medical device company that designs  develops  and commercializes products for people with insulin dependent diabetes  The San Diego based company is expected to have grown 2018 sales by over 60  to  164 million  while this year s forecast is for 37  growth to  225 million Tandem products include the t slim Insulin Delivery System  which just got a big technology upgrade and an FDA approval last week  On Valentines Day  Tandem announced that the FDA classified the t slim X2 insulin pump as the first in a new device category called Alternate Controller Enabled Infusion Pumps  or ACE pumps The approved indication for the t slim X2 pump states that the pump is able to reliably and securely communicate with compatible  digitally connected devices  including automated insulin dosing software  to receive  execute  and confirm commands from these devices This new type of insulin pump is described as having  interoperable  technology for delivering insulin under the skin for children and adults with diabetes  meaning it can be used with different components that make up diabetes therapy systems  allowing patients to tailor their diabetes management to their individual device preferences Profits on the Horizon  After Shares Fall from  300 to  3TNDM shares were already in the upper realms of the Zacks Rank before the expected announcement because the current sales ramp had analysts raising their earnings estimates with the 2019 consensus rising over 75  to a loss of just 77 cents This follows full year 2018 EPS expected to come in near a loss of  3 22  Tandem reports for Q4 on 2 26   which would also be 75  growth from 2017 s loss of  12 87 This acceleration in net income is a welcome event for TNDM investors  many of whom may have endured an uncomfortable ride in the past few years Five years ago  TNDM shares were trading over  300 after their November 2013 IPO  The company was also getting ready to post 3 consecutive years between 2015 and 2017 of average EPS losses near  25  In that time  shares fell steadily all the way to under  3 in late 2017  You can imagine the pain for investors who were buying  and holding  all the way down based on analyst projections about future sales for the company s new insulin pumps But patient investors finally found some relief when the Zacks Rank spotted TNDM shares as having the potential of reversing the cash hemorrhaging As analysts re worked their models  their estimates started rising in 2017 and forecasting a trough of losses  So TNDM became a Zacks  2 Rank Buy several times in the period from Q4 2017 through Q3 2018  And the stock rose from  2 to  52 by September Another weight on TNDM shares during the recovery was its battle against a Goliath of med tech competition in diabetes  Medtronic  NYSE MDT   At one point  an equally giant insurer s updated insulin pump policy  which expanded Medtronic s preferential agreement to patients age 7 and older  was seen as an enormous obstacle for our little David But some analysts believed the impact on Tandem s growing revenues would be temporary  as the prevailing cry from patients and physicians for more options  not less  would win the day  Those views are being validated now Investor and Analyst Reaction Since the FDA ApprovalSo far  the price action in the stock since February 14 has been solid  with strong buying volume pushing shares to within 50 cents of last September s 52 week high at  52 55  But actually  shares rallied all last week as some players obviously knew what was coming  with Feb 12 seeing 3 5 million shares trade on the move from  44 to  49 Meanwhile  the analyst reaction has been light too  We should look forward to more investment banks starting coverage of TNDM this year  Here s what we ve heard thus far  courtesy of TheFly com   Piper Jaffray analyst JP McKim kept his Overweight rating and  60 price target on Tandem Diabetes  calling the FDA announcement authorizing the first t slim X2 interoperable insulin pump is a  nice win  for the company  The analyst says the decision allows the company to  go market as the world s first interoperable pump   adding that the feedback on Tandem also continues to be  very strong  Robert Baird analyst Jeff Johnson raised his price target on Tandem Diabetes to  55 from  46 after the company received FDA approval of its t slim X2 pump as an  alternate controller enabled   or ACE  infusion pump  Although the analyst did not raise his estimates  he believes the designation should further differentiate Tandem and de risk the 2020 development timeline for t sport  which he believes can help sustain the company s recent momentum  There has always been the risk that the insulin pump makers are made obsolete by a new oral diabetes medicine  Until those clinical trials are underway  we ll stick with good old fashioned medical technology    and its latest innovations    to provide precision care and flexibility for diabetes patients Disclosure  I own TNDM shares for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio  MGM Resorts International MGM   formerly known as MGM MIRAGE  is a  15 billion global hospitality company  operating a portfolio of destination resort brands  including Bellagio  MGM Grand  Mandalay Bay and The Mirage The resorts offer gaming  hotel  dining  entertainment  retail  and other resort amenities including golf courses  The company operates through two segments  Domestic Resorts and MGM China  with 14 resorts in the United States and multiple Macau properties  Last week  MGM delivered a solid earnings report for Q4 but the outlook for this year saw analysts take down estimates sharply  Full year 2019 EPS projections dropped over 10  from  1 31 to  1 17 and the 2020 profit outlook fell 11  as well The  1 17 for this year still represents 18  growth over last year  but that s over a disappointing and flat 2018 which saw profit estimates crater throughout the year from projections over  1 50 to just  0 99 at the final tally   As we learned from the Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   report in late January  the economic slowdown and equity bear market in China is having a big impact on gaming in Macau  Many industry analysts expect the southern Chinese territory  which is currently the world s largest gambling region  to see revenues fall slightly in 2019 after two years of double digit growth My colleague Ben Rains recently wrote of the LVS outlook and noted  Even the smallest downturn in Macau could hurt casino operators since the region pulled in  37 billion in 2018 against  6 6 billion in Las Vegas  In particular  the region s high rollers  which account for nearly half of global gambling revenues  might decrease their spending   Three highlights from the MGM report   1  Total revenues of  3 05 billion outpaced the consensus mark of  2 95 billion and increased 17 5  year over year  The improvement was backed by higher revenues at both gaming and non gaming facilities 2  MGM China s net revenues increased 33  year over year to  687 million  courtesy of net revenue contribution of  287 million from MGM Cotai 3  The company also increased its dividend yield  by 8   on in line China revenues and its Las Vegas segment which beat relatively easy year over year comps Zacks Rank Warned Even After Favorable Supreme Court Ruling on Sports BettingLast May  my colleague Dave Bartosiak wrote about MGM as the Bear of the Day when shares were trading near  32   If you re looking for a big winner on the gaming news yesterday  you re going to have to look at stocks like Penn National   NASDAQ PENN   and Boyd Gaming   NYSE BYD    These regional players most certainly will benefit from the Supreme Court opening the door for states to legalize sports gambling  Today s Bear of the Day will also benefit from the ruling  but I want you to know what the earnings picture was like ahead of the recent event  It s not as rosy as you d like to believe I certainly agree that gaming across the country could help MGM  But until analysts start changing their EPS estimates based on the ruling  MGM is likely to remain a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Over the last thirty days  four analysts have dropped their earning estimates for the current quarter while six have dropped their numbers for the current year  The bearish sentiment has dropped the Zacks Consensus Estimate from 38 cents to 27 cents for the current quarter while current year numbers have gone from  1 45 to  1 34  end of Bartosiak notes from May 15  2018 As described earlier  those falling 2018 EPS estimates imploded further throughout the remainder of the year  And investors who heeded Dave s warning avoided a 30  drop in shares into the Q4 stock market rout  with the October lows near  24 finally getting taken out in December with a  22 print While shares have recovered during the recent big rally  the earnings outlook has only gotten worse  For investors willing to gamble here  the risk reward doesn t look promising  The best bet is to wait until the EPS estimates stop going down and stabilize  The Zacks Rank will let you know Builders  Sentiment Rises in February as Rates DeclineA high confidence level was seen among the nation s homebuilders in the month of February for newly built  single family homes  Per the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI   builder sentiment increased to a four month high in February  given the ongoing reduction in mortgage rates over the past few weeks along with continued strength in the job market Moreover  homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming spring season as the housing market slowdown of 2018 is taking a pause or rather expected to rebound  Consequently  shares of notable homebuilding companies like Meritage Homes Corp   KB Home and Lennar Corp  grew 1 9   1 2  and 1   respectively  on Tuesday Key TakeawaysNotably  NAHB s monthly builders  sentiment index increased four points to 62 and all three indices  namely present sales  future sales and buyer traffic  registered growth from January  The index measuring current single family home sales increased three points to 67  Home sales prospects for the next six months grew five points to 68 and buyer traffic surged four points to 48 In the words of NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz   Builder confidence levels moved up in tandem with growing consumer confidence and falling interest rates  The regional HMI reading was bright for Midwest and South  increasing six and five points to 55 and 66  respectively  However  Northeast and West ended on a negative note  declining two and three points to 45 and 67  respectively Builders  Confidence High on Declining Mortgage RatesMortgage rates have been declining since November 2018  Per the Freddie Mac s Primary Mortgage Market Survey  in the week ending Jan 14  2019  the 30 year  fixed rate mortgage average declined to 4 37  from the previous week s 4 41   Notably  the said rate was the lowest in the past 12 months Also  mortgage purchase applications for the month of January remained flat on a year over year basis  while gained 43  from the prior month in response to the 30  increase in the new home sales figure for the month  as per the Mortgage Bankers Association  MBA  Builder Application Survey  Market pundits are of the opinion that a healthy job market  faster wage growth  moderating price gains and lower mortgage rates are helping to generate more sales This positive momentum that the housing industry is currently experiencing can be substantiated by its share price performance  The Zacks  industry has outperformed the broader S P 500 in the past three months gaining 10 7  compared with the S P 500 index s rally of 5  Meanwhile  per the Associated Builders and Contractors analysis of U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics data on Feb 14  construction material prices fell 0 7  in January from the prior month  yet remains 1 6  higher on a year over year basis  Steel  aluminum and softwood lumber tariffs remain a headwind for homebuilders  making it difficult for them to offer affordable homes Robust Job Market Raises HopeThe buoyant employment report from the Labor Department on Feb 12  has also lifted builders  sentiment  Per the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  the number of job openings reached a record high of 7 3 million at the end of December 2018  This lifted the job openings rate to 4 7  in December from 4 6  in November  underscoring robust demand for labor  The upside stemmed mainly from strengthening payrolls and wage gains Zacks  Top 10 Stocks

129955,351470,KBH,Housing Moves  Zillow  KB Home  And LGI Homes Put On A Show,opinion,"Housing related stocks continue to show signs of a return of buying interest  I keep tabs on these  housing moves  as checks on the health of the sector  These moves are of particular interest now that investors are actively worrying about a housing slowdown just as the stocks of home builders launch into their seasonally strong period of performance 
Zillow Group Inc  NASDAQ ZG  The week started with the startling news that Zillow Group Director J  Hoag spent a whopping  24 8M to buy 850 000 shares of Zillow stock  Executive Chairman and co founder Richard N  Barton spent  19 4M on 703 497 shares  The stock responded with an 11 9  gain that has all the looks of a bottom for Zillow  Given that Hoag bought shares on November 21st and 23rd  Zillow should hold this bottom between  28 and  30 for the thesis to hold  I am a buyer on dips from here   Note well that as of the time of typing  the company has not filed any related disclosures with the SEC on these purchases  
Zillow Group  Z  is starting to push into its post earnings gap down following an 11 9  surge on news that a director loaded up on 850K shares 
KB Home  NYSE KBH  The rebound in KBH shares is one of the most encouraging signs of the current cycle for the stocks of home builders  KBH never closed lower after the day it delivered an awful earnings warning and has now completely reversed its post warning loss  The next and immediate hurdle is downtrending resistance from its 50 day moving average  DMA  and the prior peak this month  I am a buyer above those levels 
KB Home  KBH  this week finished filling the gap down from its earnings warning 
LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  On no new news that I could find  LGIH popped  out of nowhere  for a 7 8  gain  This move pushes LGIH close to a complete reversal of its post earnings loss  The stock is also now making a strong push above its downtrending 50DMA resistance  I will get bullish on LGIH after it closes above the intraday high from the first day of the post earnings reaction   47 44   It is VERY possible that bears are finally taking profits here  shorts are a substantial 23 6  of LGIH s float 
LGI Homes  LGIH  jumped 7 8  in a move that almost completed a reversal of post earnings losses 
Gafisa SA ADR  NYSE GFA  GFA is a home builder in Brazil  I include it in my chart reviews mainly out of curiosity  The technical breakout shown below has edged me closer to finally buying some shares  My main hesitation is that the bearish weight in the market makes breakout moves on speculative and expensive stocks more risky than ever 
Gafisa  GFA  broke out on the heels of a 7 6  gain 
Sherwin Williams  NYSE WMB  SHW was building itself into an encouraging recovery story after testing its May and 2018 low after a poor response to earnings  Overhead resistance from the 50DMA proved to be too much  The stock transitioned from pivoting around its 200DMA to making a fresh breakdown  I do not think SHW is a leading indicator  indeed  it was able to soar to a new all time high from the low in May while home builders continued to languish  Still  I like to keep tabs on SHW given its amazing long term performance  even at these levels SHW is a double over the last 4 years 
After almost 3 weeks of struggle  Sherwin Williams  SHW  broke down from an area of consolidation around its 200DMA and below 50DMA resistance

129964,351479,KBH,Tale Of The S P 500 Tailwind  Will The  Powell Pop  Continue ,opinion,"On the morning of Wednesday December 26  the first trading day after the Christmas Day holiday  the ES  e mini March S P 500  plunged to a new three month corrective low at 2316 75  a full 21 4  beneath its September 21 high  In the hours thereafter  ES reversed strongly to the upside  from an acute oversold condition  and with a bit of prompting from the POTUS 
In my closing commentary in our member room at  MPTrader com  I wrote 

 Today  the besieged bulls finally got some payback after weeks of downside  and days of relentless late session selling pressure  After an  iffy  start to the session  today turned out to be just the opposite of the prior 4 days  exhibiting a bullish intraday profile and strength during the last 20 minutes of trading  Indeed  the last few minutes of trading morphed from prior day s long liquidation events into FOMO    Fear of Missing Out    on a powerful upside reversal day that should have momentum tailwinds to the upside    
 Technically  there should be enormous near term tailwinds generated by today s key upside reversal that point to a challenge of the upper channel boundary at 2540  into the 2560 70 overshoot target zone before this rally is exhausted  

In the aftermath of the Christmas Upside Reversal  last week ES  e Mini March S P  traversed a range from 2438 50 to 2539 25  or 100 75 S P points  4 1    and ALL OF IT occurred on Friday after Jay Powell acquiesced to the wounded easy money masses  appearing to become a kinder  gentler  and more investor sensitive Fed chairman 
The  Powell Thrust  propelled ES up through the aforementioned  upper channel boundary at 2540   confirming my expectations for momentum tailwinds in the aftermath of the powerful December 26th Bullish Engulfing Candle  aka Key Upside Reversal Day  
Did the Powell Pop expend the remaining upside momentum from December 26  And if not  where might ES go from here  In that Friday s 100 S P point up day also represented a Bullish Engulfing Candle  aka Key Upside Reversal Day     the second in the past 7 sessions    I am expecting follow through strength that has as its next target zone 2580 2600  as noted on our latest chart 


Let s notice that each of the major upside reversals  12 26 and 1 04  coincided with a very supportive statement from a heavyweight political figure or Federal Reserve official  On the first occasion  paraphrasing   President Trump told the press that he thought the  20   stock market sell off was a great buying opportunity  On the second occasion  Fed Chair Powell told investors what they wanted to hear that the Fed would become much more sensitive to and dependent on  data  from both the real economy and the stock market  At this time  real economic data and stock prices are telling the Fed to exert more patience before continuing to raise rates again in 2019 
Whether President Trump is proven to be a lucky market timer like President Obama was in March 2009 remains to be seen  What is proven  however  is that without an accompanying very accommodative Federal Reserve policy to support and motivate investors  presidential prognostications about a bullish turn in the equity markets are destined for the trash heap 
Since late in the Fall  a tightening Fed presided over a 20  market correction amounting to 630 25 ES  S P futures  points  while the combination of a POTUS  buy recommendation  and Fed Chair Jay Powell s communications designed to ease frazzled nerves  without easing rates  has scored a recovery of 222 50 points  or just 35  of the entire Sep  Dec  decline 
Meanwhile  Quantitative Tightening  Fed reducing its   trillion balance sheet by  50 billion per month  expiring Mortgage Backed Securities and Treasury Bonds  remains on  auto pilot  until Jay Powell and Company decide it should be modified or curtailed  The Fed reduced its balance sheet by  420 billion during 2018  and is expecting to reduce it by another  600 billion during 2019  The Fed remains in tightening posture  regardless of Powell s pronouncements this past Friday 
With the next FOMC policy meeting  statement  and press conference scheduled for January 29th and 30th  we are unlikely to hear from Fed Chair Jay Powell again for at least three weeks  but we will definitely hear from President Trump  probably more frequently this coming year than in the past  if that is possible   owning to the proximity of the 2020 election 
If bullish equity index price action continues to coincide with or depend on extraneous positive POTUS and or Fed headlines  then for this week  potentially positive  or negative  market catalysts will have to emanate from progress in the US China trade talks  or not   and resolution of the Government Shutdown  or not   Although a new earnings season begins this week  possible directional catalysts will have to wait until Wednesday for results from Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   KB Home  NYSE KBH  and Lennar  NYSE LEN  
Right now  my technical set up and momentum work on ES point still higher  into the 2580 2600 target zone where I will be expecting the recovery rally off of the Dec  25th low at 2316 75 to exhibit both pattern completion and upside momentum exhaustion  In the absence of some sort of bullish catalyst that triggers additional nearer term upside progress that propels ES towards 2650 60  my work continues to warn me to treat strength as a fleeting  though powerful  counter trend rally within the dominant downtrend established after the September high 
For the start of the new week  only a decline in ES that breaks below 2490 95 support will be a significant warning signal that the recovery rally is over prior to reaching my optimal next upside target of 2580 2600  and that the dominant bear trend already is reasserting itself  ES closed at 2529 50 ",2019-01-07,Mike Paulenoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tale-of-the-sp-500-tailwind-200373155,200373155
129966,351481,KBH,KB Home  KBH  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,KB Home   NYSE KBH   is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 9  after market close  The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11 5  in the last reported quarter Moreover  the company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing six quarters  with average positive surprise of 17 6   Additionally  both its top and bottom lines increased 7 1  and 71   respectively  on a year over year basis Let s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementKB Home  one of the top home builders in the United States  has been consistently reporting solid top line numbers across its product categories  The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well  owing to its Built to Order approach and Returns Focused Growth Plan In the first nine months of fiscal 2018  total revenues increased 8  year over year  owing to 4 7  growth in home deliveries and 3  improvement in average selling price  Particularly in the Homebuilding segment  operating income increased 38  to  105 6 million in the said period Moreover  for the fiscal fourth quarter  the company expects housing revenues between  1 39 billion and  1 45 billion  versus  1 4 billion reported in the year ago quarter   This is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog  However  average selling price in the to be reported quarter is anticipated to be around  400 000  405 000  below the prior year figure of  416 500  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth quarter total revenues is pegged at  1 35 billion  implying a 3 9  decrease from a year ago KB Home Price and EPS Surprise   KB Home s gross margin has notably improved over the past three quarters  The improvement was supported by improved leverage on fixed costs owing to higher quarterly housing revenues  deliveries from higher margin communities  community specific gross margin improvement action plan  along with targeted balancing of absorption pace and pricing in communities  However  increase in land  trade labor and material costs continue to partly offset these positives Moreover  for the to be reported quarter  the company projects housing gross margin within 18 3 18 7   assuming no inventory related charges to be incurred in the future  While  gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 18 6  Also  Homebuilding operating margin  excluding the impact of any inventory related charges  is expected within 9 3 9 7  for the said quarter KB Home invested  1 4 billion in land acquisition and development in the first nine months of 2018  29  higher than the year ago level  It remains optimistic that this blend of rising active inventory  while reducing its annual interest incurred  is expected to boost the gross margin and earnings in the quarter to be reported  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth quarter earnings is pegged at 93 cents  This reflects a 10 7  year over year increase  owing to the above mentioned factors However  material cost inflations are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Also  the recently imposed tariff on imported steel and aluminum raises concern  Meanwhile  KB Home s shares have declined 24 8   underperforming its industry s decline of 19  over the past six months What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not suggest that KB Home is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for KB Home is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 93 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  KB Home currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Zacks  sector  which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarters to be reported D R  Horton   NYSE DHI   has an Earnings ESP of  3 61  and a Zacks

129998,351513,KBH,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Allstate  Edison  KB  Pulte And Lennar,opinion,For Immediate Release Chicago  IL   November 14  2018   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Allstate   NYSE ALL    Edison International   NYSE EIX    KB Homes   NYSE KBH    Pulte Group   NYSE PHM   and Lennar   NYSE LEN   A Look at the Economic Impact of the California WildfiresCalifornia is currently experiencing devastating wildfires in both the Northern and Southern  NYSE SO  regions of the state that have collectively been called the worst fire season ever  As of this writing  the death toll stands at 42   with hundreds more people still unaccounted for At least 7 000 homes have been completely lost and over 300 000 people have been evacuated   and many of them fully expect to return to homes that have been damaged or destroyed An unfortunate combination of weather conditions including low humidity and high winds has moved the fires far and fast and there s no end in sight with the two biggest fires both less than 25  contained In addition to the horrifying human toll extracted by these fires  once they are over  there will be a significant economic impact on the state of California and elsewhere Insurance CompaniesThe insurance industry might seem to be the most obviously affected group of businesses after a natural disaster  In normal times  insurers use actuarial data to predict the likelihood of any given loss and then charge appropriate premiums to be able to withstand those losses after investment gains on the premiums they ve held and the administrative costs of their operation Natural disaster events complicate that process because they are more difficult to predict than  for instance  the number of homes that will be damaged by fires caused by faulty wiring or unattended stoves  but also because disasters cause a large number of insured losses to occur simultaneously  rather than being spread out over many months or years during which insurers collected premiums and invested the proceeds Although they are more difficult to predict  insurers are certainly aware of the inevitability of occasional large losses from natural events and they do their best to manage reserves accordingly and also make use of the reinsurance markets to diversify their risks as much as possible According to BusinessInsurance com  the insurance companies with the most exposure to the current situation in California   based on net written premium in the affected areas   are State Farm with 11 7   Farmers with 11 5  and Liberty Mutual with 6 2  State Farm and Liberty Mutual are both mutual organizations  owned by the policyholders who pay premiums rather than traditional shareholders in public markets  Farmers is a subsidiary of the Zurich Insurance Group  an enormous Swiss firm that trades publicly on the SIX Swiss exchange US based insurance companies like Allstate are expected to have considerably less exposure to the California fires  as well as extensive reinsurance in place that will help mitigate losses Based on share price performance since the fires started a week ago  it appears that investors are not significantly concerned about outsized losses at these publicly traded firms UtilitiesUtility companies operating in California now appear to be about to bear the brunt of the most significant losses  Shares of Edison International   parent company of So Cal Edison   have tumbled over the past few days  falling more than 25  at their lows  Though EIX has rebounded somewhat  PCG shares continue to fall In addition to the anticipated costs of replacing vast amounts of utility infrastructure to restore service to the affected areas  California law allows utilities to be held liable for damages if their equipment is deemed responsible for starting fires  even if they were operating within the appropriate regulatory guidelines PG E in particular has already been facing liability issues associated with the wildfires in wine country in October of 2017 that caused in excess of  16B in damage  The company recorded a charge of  2 5B in the final quarter of 2017   in connection with the Northern California wildfires  Prior to the most recent fires  PG E had already suffered credit downgrades from Fitch and Moody s because of their liability for the 2017 fires and had retained the services of a debt restructuring consulting firm  While regulators usually seek to avoid the bankruptcy of public utilities and often allow rate increases as an alternative  PG E could hardly afford another potentially huge liability event The final tally on the utility companies exposure to wildfire damage will likely not be known for months or longer  but it seems unlikely that they will emerge unscathed ConstructionOnce the fires have been extinguished  a massive rebuilding effort will get underway to replace the lost homes  businesses and other structures Most of the rebuilding will be performed by privately held specialty firms rather than large homebuilders in California like KB Homes  Pulte Group and Lennar   who concentrate on big development projects on land they already control   but all of that construction will likely have effects on the entire industry Increased demand for labor and materials like lumber and copper is expected to send prices higher  The homebuilders have already had an extremely tough year in 2018  partly due to the costs associated with historically tight labor markets in skilled construction trades and the situation in California can only make that worse Obviously  it s important not to underestimate or ignore the enormous suffering these events have caused thousands of California families  but as investors  it s important to also understand the potential economic effects on businesses Right now it looks as though the aftermath of the fires will reverberate through the California economy   and beyond   for the foreseeable future The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban

130000,351515,KBH,KB Home Confirmed Longstanding Market Fears Over Home Builders,opinion,"In most of my Housing Market Reviews this year  I chronicled the growing warning signs in the housing market and the on going technical damage in the stocks of home builders  Until the last few months  I remained hopeful that a turn around waited around the corner  I kept looking for the reassurances of the home builders to translate into renewed buying interest  I took advantage of the October sell off to launch the seasonal trade right into the teeth of the worsening technicals and fundamentals  Last week s earnings warning from KB Home  NYSE KBH  may have prematurely ended the prospects of a good seasonal run  If so  this letdown would be yet one more in a long line of disappointments 
Market skepticism has been high for the most of the year  One big warning sign came when KBH raised guidance in April and investors still faded the stock  In January  2016 and before that in January  2015  disappointing results from KBH took down the stock and the sector  In the midst of the January  2016 selling I recommended buying KBH  and other home builders  as contrary bets against the recession the market seemed eager to front run  That call worked out extremely well  This time around  I am not recommending a contrarian bet  without technical confirmation  because KBH s earnings warning gave me serious concerns 
Basically  KBH acknowledged a slowdown in the housing market  The warning brought an immediate flashback to August s warning from Redfin  NASDAQ RDFN  of a market slowdown  The warning took a day to register losses in home builder stocks  but they rebounded  A true breakdown took another month to happen 
Management used the term  slowdown  and allowed analysts on the conference call to freely throw that term around  The final warning that forced the company to reduce guidance was a quarter to date  the first 10 weeks of Q4  14  year over year drop in net orders  KBH explained that this drop came from a reduced community count  deferred orders  and a longer decision making process for consumers as they  absorb  and  digest  higher prices and higher mortgage rates  KBH is also facing competitive pressures as other builders increase incentives  KBH is mainly responding to this slowdown by focusing on selling lower cost homes as it pushes an increase in community count  KBH expects this change in focus to increase its pool of buyers without inviting an expanded pool of competition  quite a balancing act    The company even reduced square footage plans in existing communities 
Interestingly  this  rotation  began earlier in the year  Here is how management explained things in the Q3 earnings conference call in late September  emphasis mine  

And while the national numbers are four months  of new home inventory   many of the markets we re in today it s still two months  a month and a half  and then when you get into the price points we play at  it s even less  So there s not a lot of inventory out there at the affordable price bands  and much of the headlines  I think  are tied to higher price points that are seeing some slowdown  And we re trying to stay ahead of that at the price points that are slower  are well above us today and where we re operating  But if it comes down  we have to be prepared for that  and it s in part why we re rotating to lower priced communities  positioning smaller models in higher priced areas even to keep affordable and keep some insulation there 

That last line was one of those telling moments and was likely part of the reason why investors continued selling KBH after the Q3 earnings report  The announcement confirmed Redfin s earlier warning 
With the rotation in full swing  KBH thinks it can maintain targets for margin percentages from its  Returns Focused Growth Plan  but not absolute revenue numbers  Revenue guidance for 2019 dropped from a range of  5 0 5 3B to  4 7B to  5 2B  This guidance of course holds out the hope that KBH can still figure out how to stay within the original range  At the low range  KBH may only generate 4 4  year over year revenue growth  just under 2018 s expected year over year growth of 4 7  and significantly below the 2017 year over year growth of 19 4  
KBH guided 2019 gross margin to the range of 17 7 18 7   During the Q3 earnings call  KBH projected 18  gross margin for 2018 and that remains the same  The company emphasized that its 2018 expectation for operating income margin of 8 1  means the company hit its 8 9  2019 target a year early  Similarly  2018 s expected 10 4  return on invested capital  ROIC  hurdles the 2019 10  target threshold  Unfortunately  2019 guidance allows for operating income margin allows for a possible miss of the 2019 target  the new guidance is for a range of 7 7    8 7  
The market s reaction to the warning was harsh and swift  The stock gapped down and lost 15 3  to close around a 20 month low  Friday s 7 8  rebound recovered the previous low set in the October sell off 
KB Home  KBH  rebounded sharply from Thursday s price collapse  Could this surge of buying interest finally deliver a sustainable bottom for KBH 
Sympathy selling was widespread across home builders  It was enough to send the iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  back to its October low  However  Friday s rebound was enough to close that gap right away   a potentially bullish sign  especially with Thursday s trading action forming a  hammer  bottoming pattern 
The iShares US Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  jumped 2 0  to recover its post KB Home  KBH  loss 
Over the last two trading days  the stocks of three other home builders stuck out the most to me  DR Horton  NYSE DHI   PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  and Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL   The charts below speak volumes 
D R  Horton  DHI  lost 9 0  after reporting earnings  While the KBH sympathy selling took DHI down to a new a 16 month low  Friday s 3 6  rally reversed the previous day s loss and then some 

Pulte Home  PHM  managed to surge in response to its earnings report in October  The KBH sympathy selling barely dented the stock so Friday s 3 6  rally not only reversed the previous day s loss but also created a fresh 50DMA breakout  
Toll Brothers  TOL  suffered a particularly harsh blow from KBH sympathy selling with a 5 9  loss  While the stock did not quite retest October s low  the Friday rally hardly put a dent in Thursday s loss 
Based on the above reactions  DHI looks like it remains in trouble  PHM is still a strong stock and buyable here as a part of the seasonal trade on home builders  TOL is troubling because it sold off like the company reported bad earnings news alongside KBH  I assume that investors were alarmed by KBH s assessment of a demand slowdown in higher price points  This commentary strikes right at the heart of TOL s high end market  TOL reports earnings in two weeks on December 4th after market  TOL earnings are always heavily watched and covered  but this next one will take on extra prominence and importance given the bearish context 
In the meantime  the fresh selling in KBH pushed the stock deeper into recessionary valuations  Price book is 0 8  Price sales is a meager 0 4  Trailing P E sits at 12 0 while forward P E is a meager 6 4  These metrics make KBH look like a screaming buy if not for the deteriorating fundamentals  Still  KBH is worth speculating for a short term bounce with a stop under the post warning intraday low   16 82   Beyond that  I see no reason to rush in for a longer range play until unless KBH can close Thursday s gap and  preferably  break through 50DMA resistance 
Be careful out there

130002,351517,KBH,Can Builder Confidence Recover From November s Sharp Plunge ,opinion,The confidence level among the nation s homebuilders plunged eight points in November  the sharpest one month drop since 2014  The November reading is also the lowest since mid 2016 as rising prices and borrowing costs are coming in the way of buyers  affordability  according to the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Wells Fargo Housing Market Index Following the latest reading  the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  dropped 0 4   while Invesco Dynamic Building   Construction ETF  fell 0 9   Meanwhile  homebuilding stocks have already been thrashed this year in anticipation of slower growth in housing and higher costs for construction companies  The Zacks  industry has lost 34 7  this year  whereas the broader S P 500 Composite market has gained 2 2   Major homebuilders such as D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI    KB Home   NYSE KBH    PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM    NVR Inc    NYSE NVR   and Lennar   NYSE LEN   have lost 31 9   40 6   24 9   31 6  and 35 1   respectively  this year  Key TakeawaysHomebuilder sentiment fell eight points in November to 60 from October and all three indices   present sales  future sales and buyer traffic   registered a fall  In the words of NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz   While home price growth accommodated increasing construction costs during this period  rising mortgage interest rates in recent months coupled with the cumulative run up in pricing has caused housing demand to stall  Current sales conditions fell seven points to 67  Buyer traffic plunged eight points to 45  the lowest since August 2016  and sales prediction over the next six months dropped 10 points to 65  Regionally  the HMI reading was dismal for South and West  declining 2 points and 3 points to 68 and 71  respectively  However  Northeast and Midwest ended on a positive note  increasing two points and one point  respectively Affordability Taking a Toll on HousingChallenges like inventory shortage are prevailing in the U S  real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country  thereby affecting affordability  In addition to this  rising mortgage rates in recent months has been making the operating backdrop tough for homebuilders According to Freddie Mac s latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey  the 30 year rate remained unchanged from last week  averaging 4 94  for the week ending Nov 15  2018  Notably  this is still an increase from last year s rate of 3 95  and the highest since February 2011 Meanwhile  higher home borrowing rates have kept many potential buyers on the sidelines  Mortgage applications in the United States dropped 3 2  in the week ended Nov 9  after a 4  drop in the previous week  per the report from the Mortgage Bankers Association  Moreover  refinance applications decreased 4 3  and applications to purchase a home fell 2 3  Apart from rising mortgage rates that are expected to pose serious threats to the construction market  higher input costs are also compressing homebuilders  margins at a time when political pundits are seriously considering a national infrastructure revamp Construction material prices increased 7 9  year over year and 0 5  month over month in October  according to an Associated Builders and Contractors   ABC   analysis of information provided by the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  Prices for nonresidential construction inputs also increased 0 5  month over month and more than 8  year over year Is Recovery Due in the Near Term Despite the sharp fall in builders  sentiment  an important economic indicator  the reading remains in the positive territory as any reading above 50 signals improving conditions  Homebuilders indicated continued consumer demand for new homes  That said  the recent market data related to sales  permits  starts and existing home sales revealed a decelerating growth rate  which raised apprehensions about housing recovery  Moreover  labor shortage  trade driven material price increases  limited land availability along with increases in new and existing home sale prices have been making things worse Notably  the Federal Reserve hiked the funds rate for the third time this year in September to 2 2 25  in response to a strong U S  economy and signaled a gradual pace of rate hikes  going forward  It was the eighth hike since late 2015  The central bank maintained its forecast of the fourth rate increase before the year end and three more in 2019 The Fed is expected to raise interest rates in December  However  the recent housing slowdown may influence the extent to which the central bank will actually extend its interest rate hikes since late 2015 Economist Dietz also stated   Recent policy statements on economic conditions have lacked commentary on housing  even as housing affordability has hit a 10 year low   said Dietz Homebuilding biggies  like Lennar and KB Home  have also trimmed their expectations recently  KB Home slashed its guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2018 revenues and average selling prices  Lennar has also adjusted both deliveries and new order guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  to reflect the impact of Hurricane Florence and the sluggishness that it has been currently experiencing The only thing that is positive for the homebuilding industry is robust economic growth and a solid job market that provide the basis for demand Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider

Consumer Price Index  CPI  was up 2 8   its biggest year on year rise since early 2012  The core CPI measure  which excludes volatile food and fuel costs  rose 2 2  from May 2017  Fed expects inflation to rise 2 1  for this year through 2020 Therefore  to put a check on inflation  an interest hike was quite imperative  Though an increase in interest rates increases the cost of borrowing

mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders Will This Lower Affordability The rise in interest rates comes at a time when home prices are increasing owing to supply constraints and increased raw materials costs  Builders are spooked by higher aluminum and steel costs  thanks to the newly imposed tariffs  This coupled with increased lumber prices owing to an import tariff is denting builders  margins  prompting them to bump up prices  Further  troubles like labor shortage and limited land availability continue to make things difficult Additionally  the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market  Higher interest rates will only flare up such issues but will also delay home purchases by millennials Total mortgage applications fell 1 5  in the week ending Jun 8 as is evident from the latest Mortgage Bankers Association

130037,351552,KBH,A Struggling Flicker As New And Existing Home Markets Diverge ,opinion,"I saw a flicker of hope for home builders in the last Housing Market Review  Traders decided to snuff that flicker out very quickly afterward  Breakouts transformed into new tops and now the struggling flicker comes from home builder stocks holding support  The short term path ahead looks like chop at best  especially with the latest round of earnings bounces receiving quick fades  Investors are essentially following a playbook that runs independent of almost anything the home builders say 
Lennar  NYSE LEN  broke down to a 16 month low ahead of its last earnings report as investors rushed to get out the way  LEN s report was as strong as usual  and the stock gapped up yet again  And again  sellers rushed in to fade the post earnings pop  THIS time  sellers failed to follow through  the stock closed the last week at a post earnings high on top of a fresh breakout above resistance at its 50 day moving average  DMA   If LEN can actually surpass the May high  the stock will finally position itself for the small run to or past 200DMA resistance that some speculators  like on CNBC s Fast Money  keep anticipating 
 
Lennar  LEN  looks like it is finally bottoming but can it make the long anticipated run to or past 200DMA resistance 

KB Home  NYSE KBH  was trading just above its 9 month low ahead of its latest earnings report  The post earnings move was a bullish gap up that easily cleared 50DMA resistance  Sellers went right back to work the following day and almost filled the gap  KBH crawled back above its 50DMA  but buyers still have a lot to prove  they need to push KBH to a new post earnings high 
 
KB Home  KBH  is clinging to a post earnings gain as its 50DMA continues to serve as a pivot line 

Net net  home builders are going absolutely nowhere  The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  is trading right in the middle of the trading range that has dominated trading since the February sell off 
 
The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  is churning in a trading range full of false hopes and close calls 
 Source for charts  FreeStockCharts com
ITB is stuck despite a near uniform voice from home builders about the strength of the market  Did the run up to the January highs anticipate all the good news left for the time being in this cycle or do the current troubles telegraph worse conditions ahead  The housing data are mixed with growing weakness in existing home sales while new homes are looking strong again in starts and sales  Home builder sentiment sits in the middle with an apparent peak already in place for now 
New Residential Construction  Single Family Housing Starts    May  2018 Housing starts surged and left no doubt that home builders remain steadfastly confident as ever in the market even if investors and traders are not 
Single family housing starts for May were revised significantly upward from 894 000 to 901 000  a second straight month of significant upward revisions  May starts increased month over month by 3 9  to 936 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts SURGED 18 3   This sudden spike higher has put a definitive end to the deceleration trend from previous months  Recall that February s 2 6  year over year increase was the smallest annual gain since October  2017 at 1 8  
 
Housing starts picked up the pace  The uptrend looks very secure again as well 
Over the previous 8 months  regional year over year changes in starts exhibited wide dispersion  For May  housing starts were very strong across the board  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each gained 18 2   12 2   22 6   and 13 7  year over year respectively in May 
Existing Home Sales   May  2018 Slowing sales for existing homes are likely helping to dampen the mood for the stocks of home builders even though limited inventories continue to be the dominant story constraining existing home sales 
The February existing sales numbers ended a 2 month sales decline and softened a bit my alarm bells  In March  monthly sales continued to increase  but the year over year change was a decrease  For April  both monthly and year over year changes were declines  May recorded similar declines and put existing home sales right back in  yellow  cautionary territory 
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  While the National Association of Realtors  NAR  pulled the inventory card yet again  it also made a point to combine that lament with warnings about affordability   Closings were down in a majority of the country last month and declined on an annual basis in each major region Incredibly low supply continues to be the primary impediment to more sales  but there s no question the combination of higher prices and mortgage rates are pinching the budgets of prospective buyers  and ultimately keeping some from reaching the market  
The NAR attributed February s sales gains to a  seasonal  jump in inventory  In the April press conference the NAR noted that new listings were up year over year and optimistically projected that inventory could actually increase year over year in late summer or fall  The NAR strained to get encouragement from May s slight increase in inventory by noting that May  2017 saw a decline in inventory  In other words  there is some reason to think the tide is ever so slightly starting to turn  This optimism is definitely a stretch when a decline in sales pace is likely responsible for a good amount of the inventory increase 
In the press conference  the NAR offered some ideas for increasing inventory  consider repurposing buildings like newly vacant shopping malls  streamlining local government permitting and environmental reviews  The NAR is now pleading with the market to correct itself  The frustration is understandable since transactions are the lifeblood of realtors 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales in May of 5 43M was down 0 4  month over month from 5 45M in sales for April  downwardly revised from 5 46M   Year over year sales decreased 3 0  and once again stayed consistent with the current trend of decelerating existing home sales 
 
The on going decline in existing home sales makes 2018 s Spring selling season a bust 
  As of the March  2018 data  the NAR further reduced historical data to just 13 months  For historical data from 1999 to 2014  click here  For historical data from 2014 to 2018  click here  Source for chart  National Association of Realtors  Existing Home Sales   EXHOSLUSM495S   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  July 4  2018 
The share of sales going to first time buyers decreased to 31   This share was 33  in April  30  in March  29  in February and November was 33   So while the NAR raised another alarm about first time buyers    The abrupt hike in mortgage rates this spring  along with price appreciation and competition being the strongest in the entry level part of the market  is why first time buyers are not as active as they should be and their participation remains below its historical average    I think there is a lot more noise than signal in these data  The share is just bouncing around  Recall that September was the first time in two years where the share dropped below 30  
The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35   The NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 15  of homes in May  the same as February through April and down from 16  a year ago  Investor sales averaged a share of 15  in 2017 and 14  in 2016 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 36th straight month  By contrast  inventory increased from April to May by 2 8   a FIFTH straight monthly increase  The NAR noted in its February press conference that inventory  always  increases after the Christmas holiday  However  I think I was correct in suspecting that this increasing trend looks like more than post holiday effects  The trend is also consistent with the NAR s expectation of a potential inventory inflection point later this year  For contrast  recall that during its June  2017 press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  For now the supply crisis continues to run deep at 4 1 months of supply at the current sales rate  down from 4 2 a year ago  The 1 85M homes for sale represents a 6 1  decrease from the previous April 
Existing home sales failed to increase across all regions with three declining outright  Northeast  11 7   Midwest  2 3   South 0 0   West  4 1  year over year  As usual  regional sale fluctuations had no relationship to the on going price run ups  The Northeast provided a surprising exception to the typical story of substantial jumps in median prices  I cannot even remember when a region recorded a decline   Northeast  1 8   Midwest 4 2   South 4 5   West 4 1  
May s 4 9  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home delivered the 75th consecutive month with a year over year increase  The median price of  264 800 is significantly higher than April s  257 900 and is a second straight new all time high  Unlike the previous month  the NAR acknowledged this record 
Single family sales declined 0 6  on a monthly basis and decreased on a yearly basis by 3 0   The median price of  267 500 was up 5 2  year over year 
During the April press conference  the NAR provided an update on the impact of tax reform on existing home sales  The NAR observed that fewer and fewer people are expressing concern about the limits on the mortgage tax deduction  However  they ARE starting to worry about increasing interest rates  In May s conference call  the NAR pointed out that higher rates do have a real cost impact on top of price increases  the average homeowner s mortgage has gone from  1072 to  1190 per month  an 11  increase  The NAR pointed out that wages have certainly not gone up this much 
June s press conference piled on to the ominous notes  In addition to the fresh warnings on affordability  the NAR referenced the 2018 report of Harvard s Joint Center for Housing Studies to lament that the housing market is becoming one of haves and have nots  Of course  this dichotomy has long been an issue  I used the same report from four years ago to point out impacts of affordability problems  The NAR even surfaced the unique issues minorities are facing affording a home  The NAR warned that housing affordability is almost becoming a crisis 
The NAR s tone continues to deteriorate ever so subtly with each passing month even as it stretches to look for the positives 

In February  new home sales barely eked forward  New home sales were resurgent in March  April sales did not keep pace on a monthly basis but delivered a strong year over year performance  In a stark contrast to existing home sales  new home sales in May surged on a monthly and year over year basis 
The Census Bureau revised April sales of new single family homes downward from 662 000 to 646 000  a second straight month with a sizable downward revision  New home sales for May increased 6 7  month over month and increased 14 1  year over year to 689 000  Year over year gains have regularly hit double digits since 2012  November s 26 6  jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  May breaks a string of four months of single digit gains which represented a concerning deceleration in new home sales 
 
New home sales are streaking higher again as a new post recession high comes into sight

In December  the inventory of new homes dropped to 5 2 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  February s inventory stood at 5 9 months  March s inventory dropped back to 5 2 months  April s inventory sat at 5 4 months worth of sales  and May dropped back to 5 2  Note well how declining inventory does not coincide with tightly constrained sales as what happens with existing home sales 
March s revised median price of  335 400 was a 4 3  year over year gain  The revised average sales price of  366 000 was a 4 8  year over year decline so lower priced new homes well outpaced the sales of high priced new homes  For April  higher priced homes surged back  April s median price of  312 400 was a mere 0 4  gain  but the average price soared 11 3   May s median price of  313 000 was an actual year over year decline  The average price also declined 2 6  year over year 
On a regional basis  new home sales exhibited divergence with just two regions carrying the load for May  After a string of very strong gains since August  the Northeast finally ran out of gas in January with a 44 2  year over year plunge  For February the Northeast returned to gains with an 8 8  jump only to plunge again 52 5  in March  For April  the Northeast scraped out a 5 3  gain  For May  the Northeast fell again this time by 16 3   The Midwest soared in April by 26 4  and soared again in May by 40 3   The South gained 19 2  year over year  The West cooled off from January s blistering 33 2  year over year gain to gain 3 1  year over year for February  The West heated up again in March with a 24 7  jump  The West stayed hot in April with an 18 9  gain in sales  For May  the West cooled off again by eking out a 0 6  gain

In the April housing market review  I explained why I would not have thought much of March s slight decline in the Housing Market Index  HMI   At 70  the HMI was still higher than it was for most of 2017  For April  the HMI declined yet again  that time by two points to 68  revised downward by a point   The HMI popped back up to 70 in May only to fall back to 68 for June  Each of the components of the HMI dropped by a point  Together  these components show a pattern of languishing in 2018 although they are all still at relatively high levels 
The statement from the NAHB in May was very positive with a big caveat for rising prices  For June  NAHB made an even bigger issue of lumber prices by shining a spotlight on trade actions that have driven those prices higher 

 Builders are optimistic about housing market conditions as consumer demand continues to grow  However  builders are increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are hurting housing affordability  Record high lumber prices have added nearly  9 000 to the price of a new single family home since January 2017  

 
The components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  continue to languish in 2018 and suggest that the HMI has topped out for the time being 
Even more telling is an NAHB May article titled  Number of Builders Reporting a Shortage of Framing Lumber Surges   The 31  of builders reporting shortages in framing lumber is the highest since the NAHB started asking the question in 1994  This percentage is the highest of any material since 2006 when the housing boom was at a peak and stretching availability of several building materials  The NAHB pointed out the harmful impact of President Trump s trading policies 

 It is probably not a coincidence that the top five items on the 2018 shortage list are made of softwood lumber or steel  both of which have been targeted by the Administration with new import tariffs over the past year  

While the overall HMI decreased  the Northeast and West HMIs increased by 5 and 1 point respectively  The Midwest declined by 3 points  The South declined by 2 points 
Parting thoughts A lot of stories about housing crises  affordability issues  and gentrification caught my attention over the past month  For example  the Atlanta Journal Constitution  AJC  posted an opinion piece about the increasing expense of living in Atlanta   Torpy at Large   Homes from the  500s   So  where do regular folks go   The author wondered like many Atlantans who are these people who can afford such relatively expensive homes  I read a foreboding sense of displacement 
As another example  The Economist posted a very interesting  alternative view of gentrification in a piece titled  In praise of gentrification   The author demonstrated that concept of static neighborhoods runs counter to principles of inclusion and diversity  The piece even showed data on certain situations where poor homeowners have benefited from the increased value of their neighborhoods  Gentrification is a very contentious topic that deserves even more attention  There are a lot of extreme voices in the debate and not enough in the middle where I think workable compromises exist 
On the positive side  Marketplace produced a story describing how younger home buyers are figuring out how to land their first homes 


Finally  I have not paid enough attention to the real estate companies that make money on facilitating market transactions  I finally bought some Redfin  RFIN   and I am constantly looking for an  re entry on Zillow Group  ZG   Marketplace interviewed the CEO who introduced the concept of the company as a  real estate media company   This is basically a way of dressing up the ad based revenue model of the company 

  we have all this incredible information  it empowers consumers  and then we make money by selling ads  So we ll do about a billion and a half of revenue this year and it s advertising driven  So when you re looking at a home for sale  you ll see a couple buyers  agents next to that listing  and those are agents that are paying us to show up there and try to help you buy that house

130040,351555,KBH,The U S  Housing Market And Home Builders Are In Trouble,opinion,"Many of you know that I haven t been exactly bullish on the U S  housing market   especially the construction stocks  That s why in early March I wrote about and recommended betting against the home builders  you can read that here  
I specifically made bets against KB Homes  NYSE KBH  because they target first time home buyers  And I believed the lofty expectations from out of touch economists would fall flat  which they have  
Since then  news after news has come out showing that the housing market is faltering  For instance   August was the fifth straight month that annual price gains in the 20 City Index  top 20 cities in the U S   decelerated 
This alone isn t worth getting anxious over   but all the other housing data is coming in ugly as well     Estimates show that for the first time in nearly 10 years  residential investment is set to subtract from annual U S  GDP growth  And that the August  sales of existing homes  missed analyst projections  as well as  new home sales  fell three months straight   the weakest pace in nine months 
But the real crisis here is that the housing markets stalling out from buyers shying away from the higher prices and higher mortgage rates  the 30 year fixed mortgage is the highest it s been since 2011  
This is the real demand side problem     
Many economists and mainstream pundits are baffled by this  The Trump tax cuts  a multi decade low in unemployment  and an 18 year high in consumer confidence should have home prices and sales surging   right  Yet they aren t   so what gives 
Many who ve studied the texts of the late Austrian economist   F A  Hayek   knew that this weaker housing market was inevitable after the high growth years  browse through our Palisade Recommended Reading List to see his best work  
Because of the housing bust and financial meltdown of 2008  the Federal Reserve engaged in ZIRP  zero interest rate policy  and money printing via QE to subsidize mortgage lenders  housing construction  and home prices  The low rates allowed many deep in debt  including corporations  to refinance  and it also kept home prices from declining 
Not too mention the increase in rent prices over the last decade  as hedge funds gobbled up homes to rent out  spurred a boom in apartment construction  I live in Scottsdale and I see it every day   endless rows of freshly built and over priced apartments that are pretty much empty 
This  boom  though caused supply to soar  But demand hasn t matched it 
Everyone that needed to refinance their mortgage already has   and won t again at these higher rates  And incoming new home buyers are being priced out 
Remember investing 101 tells us that high prices demand higher prices  But eventually  prices get too high that no new money comes in 
And that s what we re starting to see  The upward trend in housing over the last few years is now stalling out   hitting a peak   and soon will reverse downwards as prices drop 
Just look at U S  Housing Macro Surprise Index and U S  Homebuilder Stocks Index   it s declined tremendously this year  The S P Supercomposite Homebuilding Index is down 21  year to date and on pace to be the largest annual drop since 2008 

Some loony economists claim that rising home prices are from a lack of new homes built  Meaning many aren t selling even though many want to buy  But if that were the case  then home builders would be doing very well 
Yet they re not  So   like I wrote above   it comes down to demand side problems 
I expect the housing sector to continue weakening  Especially as the Fed continues their tightening and balance sheet unwinding 
Home prices have outpaced  real   after inflation  wages by many fold for years  This means debt s needed to keep things going  And don t expect people to easily afford the higher borrowing costs from the Fed s rate hikes 
The last time rates got up too high  debtors couldn t manage their interest payments and home prices fell  Taking down the entire global economy with it 
So as long as the Fed keeps hiking rates   expect the housing market to become increasingly fragile ",2018-09-26,Adem Tumerkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-us-housing-market-and-home-builders-are-in-trouble-200345597,200345597
130043,351558,KBH,KB Home  Yet Another Post Earnings Fade For A Home Builder ,opinion," KB Home shares jump on third quarter earnings    such is the kind of quick trigger post earnings headline that consistently fails for home builders  KB Home  KBH  opened higher by 5 7  but was all downhill from there  At the close  KBH lost 3 1  on the day in a major reversal  This close was a vast improvement on a loss which reached 6 4  at the intraday low  Bottom fishers were not able to push the stock back over its declining 50 day moving average  DMA  

KB Home  KBH  faded hard post earnings on extremely high trading volume to close below its 50DMA 
In her reporting  Diana Olick  CNBC s housing market reporter  pointed to a red flag in a 26  cancellation rare  most home builders are  in the teens   KBH did not address this high cancellation rate and analysts did not ask about it either  Seeking Alpha Transcript   However  this rate was only up by one percentage point year over year  KBH simply tends to have a high cancellation rate 
As usual  KBH reported generally strong results  From the earnings slide presentation and the earnings release  percentage changes on a year over year basis  
Housing Revenues   7 
Net income   74 
Earnings per diluted share   71 
Operating income   38 
Adjusted housing gross profit margin   140 basis points
Deliveries   8 
Average Selling Price   1 
Net Order Value   5 
Net Orders   3 
Backlog Value   4 
Ending Community Count   3 
Average Community Count   7 
Absorption  net orders per community  per month   11 
During the conference call  KBH summarized its guidance in strong terms 

  a solid outlook for the fourth quarter  we expect a meaningful improvement in our book value by the end of this year  We are poised to finish 2018 with growth in revenues and a significantly higher year over year operating margin fueled primarily by the expansion of our gross margin  a key goal for us  As we look ahead to 2019  the combination of community count growth beginning in the fourth quarter of this year  a substantial increase in communities slated to open in 2019  and maintaining our solid absorption pace gives us confidence in achieving our targets next year  

Still  investors likely found reasons to nitpick and sell in the details  KBH lowered metrics on average selling price and revenue  emphasis mine  

 Our  2 billion backlog provides visibility on deliveries for the remainder of this year  supporting our 2018 expectations including housing revenues that are at the low end of our previous guidance range  Although we are pleased with our year over year absorption pace increase in the third quarter  we now recognize in retrospect that our full year revenue guidance from last quarter was too aggressive based on the timing of getting our communities open and establishing our targeted pace to support projected fourth quarter deliveries 
In addition  with our backlog currently weighted outside of California  we re lowering our ASP expectations from our previous guidance  reflecting our third quarter backlog ASP that is down 4  year over year  which will also impact our revenues  Managing the business for the balance of 2018  we made the decision to maintain our pace price discipline and achieve a higher gross margin for this year as opposed to running our communities at a faster pace to preserve delivery volumes 
As a result  we re now expecting a gross margin of approximately 18  for this year at the high end of our previous guidance range  

Net net  it was yet another fade for post earnings action for a major home builder  The impact rippled throughout the sector  Toll Brothers  TOL  finished reversing all its post earnings gains with a 2 5  loss on the day  Lennar  NYSE LEN  lost 2 0  with a 19 month closing low  The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  lost 1 4  to close exactly at a 52 week low 

The price action in iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  accelerated to the downside partly thanks to the poor response to KBH earnings  ITB closed at a new 52 week low 
This month s round of housing data have not improved the outlook for the housing market  I will cover this and more in my next Housing Market Review  It looks like time is running out on a good start for the seasonally strong period for home builders

130067,351582,KBH,Lennar  LEN  To Gain From Acquisitions  Weak Margins Hurt,opinion,Lennar Corporation s   NYSE LEN   diversified line of home offerings for first time  move up and active adult homebuyers  and positive housing market fundamentals are the driving factors for this leading homebuilder in the United States  Additionally  synergies from its recent acquisitions are also encouraging Recently  this leading homebuilder reported stellar first quarter of fiscal 2018 results wherein earnings as well as revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 7  and 3 3   respectively The company reported adjusted earnings of  1 11 per share that exclude integration costs related to the acquisition of CalAtlantic Group  Inc  and one time non cash write down of deferred tax assets due to reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate  Including these items  the reported figure came in at 53 cents per share in the quarter  increasing considerably from the year ago profit level of 16 cents per share  The improvement was primarily attributable to greater demand for homes accompanied with higher prices Total revenues of  2 98 billion increased 28  year over year as the Homebuilding  Financial Services and Multifamily segments performed significantly well Meanwhile  Lennar s shares have outperformed its  year to date  Earnings estimate revisions have been mixed in the past seven days  Earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 have moved down 2 3  but rose 2 5  for 2019  in the said period  Let s Take a Look at Lennar s Key Growth DriversPrudent Strategic Investments  Lennar is one of the well positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery driven by diverse revenue mix  steady top line performance  above average order growth and improving SG A leverage The company offers a diversified line of homes for first time  move up and active adult homebuyers  Additionally  it regularly upgrades homes to cater to the changing consumer requirements  For example  it introduced NextGen homes  or a home within a home  to allow homebuyers   who need to accommodate children and parents   to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG A line from operating leverage and investments in technology  The company was successful in meeting its target of achieving the lowest SG A percentage in its history in 2016 and continuing in fiscal 2017 as well  As a percentage of revenues from home sales  SG A expenses contracted to 9 2  in the fiscal 2017  from 9 4  in the year ago period   In the fiscal first quarter  as a percentage of home sales  SG A expenses declined 60 basis points  bps   Lennar has plans to reduce SG A expenses to 8 8 9  in fiscal 2018 Importantly  acquisitions form an integral part of Lennar s growth strategy  These buyouts have enhanced the company s product portfolio  and expanded its geographic footprint and market share In February 2017  Lennar acquired WCI  With a portfolio of high quality  low cost land and 51 communities  the integration is expected to produce strong gross margin going forward  Again  in February 2018  Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc  in a  9 3 billion deal  including debt   which will create one of the country s top homebuilders  Since the closing of the transaction  Lennar remains confident that the company will exceed its prior  100 million synergy savings expectations for fiscal 2018 and is on track to meet  365 million synergies for fiscal 2019 as well Positive Housing Market  Overall fundamentals of the housing market remained positive through 2016 and 2017  and are expected to improve further in 2018  Steady job and wage growth  a recovering economy  historically low mortgage rates  rising rentals  rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point toward a strong demand in 2018 ConcernsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  The company s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 bps year over year in fiscal 2017  primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home  Although the company s gross margin expanded 50 bps year over year  it expects gross margins to have a significantly adverse impact from the CalAtlantic acquisition date through the early part of the fiscal third quarter  as a result of the backlog writeup  Over a five month period after the closing date of the CalAtlantic transaction  Lennar will only recognize a percentage of the gross margin on the homes it delivered during that time Nonetheless  we expect this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to benefit in the near term owing to the synergies arising out of the CalAtlantic

130068,351583,KBH,4 Impressive Earnings Yield Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,If you are uncertain whether to invest your money in stocks or bonds  one key financial metric that can show you the right way is earnings yield  It is the inverse of the price to earnings  P E  ratio and can be used for detecting undervalued stocks  Moreover  the ratio can be effectively used for comparing stocks with the market or fixed income securities Earnings Yield can be defined as  Annual Earnings per Share Market Price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one which gives high earnings yield should fetch higher returns This ratio can also come in handy for comparing the performance of the market with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index exceeds the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be viewed as undervalued in comparison to bonds  This means that investing in the stock market is a better choice for a value investor However  while T bills are devoid of risks  investing in stocks always involves some risks  Hence  it would be prudent to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market The Winning StrategyWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10  as our primary screening criterion  but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns  So  we have added the following parameters to the screen Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S P 500  This metric compares the 12 month forward EPS estimate with the 12 month actual EPS Average Daily Volume  20 Day  greater than or equal to 100 000  High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity Current Price greater than or equal to  5 Buy Rated Stocks  Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment You can see  Here are four of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen Wilmington  DE based The Chemours Company   NYSE CC   is engaged in the chemical business  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and an expected EPS growth rate of 15 5  for the next 3 5 years Los Angeles  CA based KB Home   NYSE KBH   constructs and sells a variety of new homes  It has a Zacks Rank  1 and an expected EPS growth rate of 16  for the next 3 5 years Pittsburgh  PA based United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   is a leading steel manufacturer in the United States  It has a Zacks Rank  1 and an expected EPS growth rate of 8  for the next 3 5 years Dallas  TX based Kronos Worldwide Inc   NYSE KRO   is a global producer and marketer of value added titanium dioxide pigments  It has a Zacks Rank  1 and an expected EPS growth rate of 5  for the next 3 5 years You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for a 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software  You can also create your own strategies and test them first before making investments The Research Wizard is a great place to begin  It s easy to use  Everything is in plain language  And it s very intuitive  Start your Research Wizard trial today  And the next time you read an economic report  open up the Research Wizard  plug your finds in  and see what gems come out  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material Disclosure  Performance information for Zacks  portfolios and strategies are available at   Zacks Restaurant Recommendations  In addition to dining at these special places  you can feast on their stock shares  A Zacks Special Report spotlights 5 recent IPOs to watch plus 2 stocks that offer immediate promise in a booming sector ,2018-04-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-impressive-earnings-yield-stocks-to-boost-your-portfolio-200307322,200307322
130069,351584,KBH,KB Home  A Bearish Breakdown Rewards Managing Guidance Higher,opinion,"For the second time in a row  KB Home  NYSE KBH  is struggling to benefit from a strong earnings report  In January  investors rushed into the stock post earnings only to create a massive blow off top  In March  sellers started fading the stock on the same day of the initial post earnings pop  Last week  KBH broke down below its 200 day moving average  DMA  and confirmed the bearish move on the following day  KBH last traded below this critical trend line almost two years ago in May  2016 

KB Home  KBH  once again confirmed resistance at its 50DMA and confirmed its bearish posture with a subsequent 200DMA breakdown 
Investors are ignoring the strong results  They are ignoring management s insistence that the company has a handle on soaring lumber and labor costs  They do not care that management thinks the economy has sufficient strength to accommodate slowly rising rates   from the conference call   we have yet to see a change in home buying behavior we re not seeing any impact yet to the customer   Investors are suspicious that home buyers will continue scrambling to buy homes in a supply constrained market   from KBH   we were able in the quarter to successfully push price and hold up a solid sales pace through the quarter  
These are the only conclusions I can make when contrasting the strong earnings results with the poor stock performance  If management understands better what is going on than investors  then there is huge upside opportunity in KBH here  However  I have looked at KBH as a fresh opportunity almost since it filled the January post earnings gap up  I now have to respect the bearish trading action with the 200DMA breakdown 
Here are some of the best highlights from  with comparisons to the first quarter 2017 results 
Total revenues  6  to  871 6 million 
Homebuilding operating income  74  to  44 0M 
Homebuilding operating income margin  200 basis points to 5 1  
Total pretax income  115  to  46 0M 
Excluding a one time charge  adjusted net income was  39 9M    40 per diluted share   compared to net income of  14 3 million    15 per diluted share  
Ending backlog value grew 10  to  1 97 billion  with all regions posting year over year increases   KBH s highest backlog value in over 10 years 
One of the more notable caveats was flat deliveries at 2 223 homes  On a regional basis  net orders in the West declined 2   a year ago they soared 49    and Texas saw a slowdown at higher price points  an on going theme across home builders  
KBH offered the following guidance during the conference call  from   
2Q housing revenues ranging from  990M to  1 05B
Narrowed full year revenue guidance to  4 55B to  4 85B
2Q operating margin  excluding the impact of any inventory related charges  from 5 9  to 6 4   Full year from 7 4  to 8 0   an increase from January s guidance 
Assuming no inventory related charges  2Q housing gross profit margin increase to 16 8  to 17 2   Full year gross margin  also excluding inventory related charges  increased to the range of 17 4  to 17 9   50 to 100 basis points above 2017  
The confidence in this guidance partially comes from the tremendous backlog on the company s books  A lot of the company s costs are also locked in due to that backlog 
There were some other key highlights from the conference call 
First timers
Buyers aged 25 to 34 were about one third of deliveries in each of the last two years and in the first quarter of 2018  Yes  millennials are buying homes 
Fifty percent of total deliveries went to first time buyers in Q1 which is consistent with the 5 year average for KBH 
Spring selling season   The spring selling season is off to a strong start  Net order value increased 8  to  1 2 billion on an 8  increase in net orders  
Balance Sheet   We have much more flexibility than we ve had at any point in probably the last eight or 10 years as a company and liquidity and positive cash flow coming out of the operations  
On top of KBH s strong earnings results comes now an ever cheaper valuation  KBH now sports a very attractive forward P E of 8 4  trailing P E of 26 3   price sales at 0 5  and price book at 1 2  I will say it again  a price book ratio of 1 0 is typically considered the bargain basement valuation of builders in the middle of an economic slowdown  In other words  the current trading action and valuation suggests that investors are bracing for a significant slowdown in the housing market  The longer the economy goes without experiencing such a slowdown  the more of a bargain home builders like KBH become 
While I am respecting the bearish trading action here  if KBH dives so deeply as to start reversing the October  2017 post earnings move  a 50DMA breakout that took KBH from  22 22 share to  24 12 share   I will go back in to buy with both hands

continuing operations came in at a record 94 cents per share  The figure trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents by 10 6  The earnings figure improved 6 8  year over year  driven by higher productivity and improved margins  Solid non residential construction demand and strong project execution boosted profits Inside the HeadlinesThe company generated a record  1 9 billion in revenues  which edged up 0 5  year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 816 million Revenues in the quarter were primarily fueled by sound performance from the combined U S  Construction and U S  Building segments  along with solid contribution from recent acquisitions Coming back to the quarter under review  the U S  Construction segment  up 3 5  year over year  sustained its robust momentum and delivered strong revenues as well as operating income growth  The segment was driven by the U S  Mechanical Construction business  up 2 6    The U S  Electrical Construction business rose 4 1  year over year The company s U S  Building Services segment revenues inched up 3 3  year over year driven by strong execution in commercial site based and energy services businesses The U S  Industrial Services revenues  affected by the lingering impact of Hurricane Harvey  continued to exhibit a lackluster performance and contracted 28 4  year over year  The hurricane led to a delay in the fall turnaround work and under absorption of overhead costs for projects which the company was unable to execute  which dented margins Revenues from total U S  operations fell 1 1  year over year to  1 793 5 million  Revenue growth from the U K  building services continued on growth trajectory and grew 35  year over year to  106 9 million  The upside was driven by profitable new contracts  solid execution in base business and increased project activity As of Mar 31  2018  EMCOR s backlog was  3 98 billion  down 0 5  year over year A rise in the backlog of the U S  Building Services  U S  Industrial Services  and U K  Building Services segments more than offset the dip in backlog for the U S  Mechanical Construction and U S  Electrical Construction From an end market perspective  the company witnessed growth in backlog for the commercial and water   wastewater markets  offset by declines in industrial  healthcare and transportation sectors EMCOR s operating income was  78 7

million  down from  269 8 million recorded on Dec 31  2017 For the quarter  cash flow used in operating activities totaled  143 4 million  significantly higher than  72 7 million recorded in the year

operations in the range of  4 10  4 70 In light of the current size and mix of its backlog and overall positive market conditions  EMCOR expects revenues in the range of  7 6  7 7 billion Our

the tone for robust future growth  reflected in the company s healthy backlog and 2018 guidance Also  a healthy balance sheet position and increasing market traction added to the company s strength  indicating bright prospects  Additionally  increasing strength in the non residential construction markets bodes well for the company  Building Services is expected to gain from sustained growth in

130071,351586,KBH,5 Top Ranked Value Stocks To Brave Decline In U S  GDP,opinion,On Apr 28  the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the first advanced estimate of the first quarter 2018 U S  GDP growth rate  While the U S  economy fared better than the first quarter consensus  the growth rate was significantly lower than the last nine months of 2017  Lackluster consumer spending  which constitutes nearly 70  of the U S  GDP  was the primary reason for slowdown in first quarter 2018 GDP Considering recent history  U S  GDP growth rate remains weakest in the first quarter of any year  Despite weak GDP growth  personal disposable income and private domestic investment have increased significantly in the first quarter  Moreover  full effect of massive reduction on both personal and corporate tax rate are yet to be derived as people received those benefits only in January The above mentioned positives are likely to push the U S  economy on a strong growth trajectory in the second quarter and there on  At this stage  investing in good value stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks is a lucrative option First Quarter GDP DeclinesPer the Bureau of Economic Analysis  the U S  GDP expanded at 2 3  in first quarter 2018  better than the consensus estimate of 2   However  this rate of growth is significantly lower than the average GDP growth rate of 2 9  in the last three quarters of 2017 and well below President Trump s targeted GDP growth rate of 3  Personal consumer spending grew at 1 1  in first quarter 2018  This was the slowest pace of growth experienced in nearly five years and significantly below the fourth quarter 2017 pace of 4  Moreover  business spending on equipment slowed to 4 7  following double digit growth in the second half of 2017  Further  investments in homebuilding have declined in the first quarter after rebounding in the fourth quarter of 2017  Government spending has also dipped after witnessing growth in the last two straight quarters Economy Likely to Bounce Back in Q2The first quarter GDP estimate generally remains weak due to seasonality  First quarter U S  GDP tends to be soft because of a seasonal quirk  Consequently  the BEA s tepid first quarter growth outlook may not be a true reflection of the U S  economy The full benefit of massive personal and corporate tax cut is yet to be realized  The  1 5 trillion tax cut measures is yet to be reflected as it has implemented only in January 2018 Moreover  U S  private sector workers experienced their highest increase in income in 11 years during the first three months of 2018  The latest Labor Department data revealed that employment cost index for wages and salaries in the private sector rose 1  in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter  Notably  this was the biggest gain since the first quarter of 2007 Meanwhile  disposable personal income has increased 6 2  in the first quarter compared with 3 8  in the previous quarter  More wealth  in the hands of consumers will likely bolster personal spending going forward Our Top Picks The fundamentals of the U S  economy remain strong despite a slowdown in the GDP growth rate  A healthy labor market  strong hike in wages and salaries  increase in personal disposable income and proposed fiscal stimulus by the government will bolster consumer s income and spending in the rest of the year At this juncture  it will be a prudent decision to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks  and a

130080,351595,KBH,Is The Slump In Starts   Permits A Real Threat To Housing ,opinion,New residential construction in the United States decreased more than expected in April 2018 as lesser starts of apartment buildings overshadowed a modest improvement in single family structures  Notably  this is the second time in the last four months that housing starts has toppled Per the latest jointly released report from the U S  Census Bureau and the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  construction of new homes fell 3 7  in April to 1 29 million units  seasonally adjusted annual rate  from the prior month  That was well below the expected 1 31 million units and followed an upward revision to the March figures The downside was mainly due to 12 6  drop in apartment starts  This was offset by a 0 1  gain in single family homes which followed a 0 8  decline in March  The report also showed sharp declines in the Midwest  Northeast  and West United States  while starts increased in the South Moreover  residential building permits  an indicator of construction activity  fell 1 8  in April to an annualized rate of 1 35 million units from March  below the expected 1 36 million units Does This Downfall Matter Although April starts and permits tumbled from the March figure  the larger picture is still overwhelming  Housing starts were up 10 5  from April 2017 buoyed by a 7 2  increase in single family homes  and a 19 1  surge in apartments  Again  permits were 7 7  above the April 2017 rate of 1 26 million units helped by a 7 9  surge in single family and 6 4  growth for buildings with five units or more The National Association of Home Builders released a separate report on Tuesday showing a surge in homebuilder confidence in the month of May  Builder confidence increased two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April  reinstating builders  confidence in the current housing market  Importantly  the reading was above the 50 mark  in the first five months of 2018  indicating a favorable outlook  Moreover  this is the fourth time in 2018 that the index has reached 70 Notably  current single family home sales increased two points in May but the indices measuring buyer traffic and sales expectations in the next six months were unchanged at 51 and 77  respectively Despite mounting confidence among homebuilders  higher lumber price is hurting homebuilders  margins  Tariffs on Canadian lumber by the Trump administration and other imported products have raised construction cost  Also  lack of supply and robust demand continue to push prices higher  thereby hurting affordability Then again  stable single family starts underscore the solid residential construction pace that will probably support economic growth given upbeat homebuilders  confidence in the market s progress  As the economy continues to improve and the millennial generation comes of age  pent up demand for homes will continue to be released Economists are of the opinion that second quarter will register higher growth as the industry starts to feel the impact of the Trump administration s  1 5 trillion income tax package on their paychecks Higher Rates Raise ConcernMortgage rates  which loosely follow the yield on the 10 year Treasury  started the year at around 4  but began rising thereafter  Higher inflationary expectations and upbeat economic growth have already driven the benchmark treasury yields to 3   The yields went on to score even higher on May 15 to touch the highest level in seven years at 3 08  Evidently  the industry is down 20  year to date  comparing unfavorably with 1 3  growth for the broader market  S P 500  as rising rates are bothering investors since the start of this year For the upcoming period  if we delve deeper  the  falls within the top 5  of the Zacks Industry Rank and a good industry rank supports growth  Again  the industry s three five year expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 17 7  is better than the broader market s 9 7  rate  raising optimism about the industry s earnings potential Currently  notable homebuilders like KB Home   NYSE KBH    Century Communities  Inc    NYSE CCS    Lyon William Homes   NYSE WLH   and M D C  Holdings  Inc    NYSE MDC   sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Toll Brothers  Inc    NYSE TOL    Beazer Homes USA  Inc    NYSE BZH   and Meritage

130099,351614,KBH,Housing Market Review  Breakdown Confirmed  Slivers Of Remaining Support  ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in February  2018 for January  2018  At the time  I connected the dots on the bearish implications of converging technicals and fundamentals  The iShares US Home Construction ETF ITB actually managed to hold onto support at its 200 day moving average until today 
So not only is the seasonal trade on home builders busted  but also the home builder index has unfortunately confirmed a bearish turn in this trading cycle 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF lost 3 4  and ended the day at a new 5 month low 
The broken 200DMA support  and declining 50DMA  means I will soon liquidate most of my remaining positions in home builders  I am not opening the escape hatch wide open because the housing data in February held steady  Moreover  I read through the latest earnings from KB Home  NYSE KBH  and found reasons for encouragement  Whenever my short term read on the market turns bullish  KBH will likely be the only  new  home builder I buy 
KBH reported strong earnings that the market quickly faded  The action has been quite a turn around from the near parabolic euphoria that coincided with KBH s January earnings report  KBH sold off so badly from a major gap that the stock erased the entire breakout from November  March earnings were initially greeted with a celebratory gap up  but sellers  perhaps learning lessons from January earnings  quickly scrambled for the exits  Today KBH lost 2 2  but managed to somehow hold its 200DMA support  I will cover KBH earnings in detail in another post 
KB Home is facing down a squeeze from a downtrending 50DMA and an uptrending 200DMA  March earnings failed to turn the tide 
One home builder is still trying to cling to bullish territory  LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH   Recall that LGIH increased guidance during its February earnings report and still sold off sharply  Until today s 5 6  whopping loss  LGIH looked like it had bullishly confirmed a 50DMA breakout  LGIH could become a major market tell 
LGI Homes lost its entire 50DMA breakout gains in one day s trading action  Can it hold onto a bullish positioning 
On the negative side  Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  flashed a warning sign last week when it closed below its 200DMA support  Today s 3 0  loss confirms the breakout AND confirms the major fade from February earnings 

Toll Brothers closed at a 6 month low as it confirmed a very bearish breakdown 
Going forward  I have greatly tempered my expectations for the next few months during which home builders will finish limping through a period that is supposed to deliver relative strength against the S P 500 SPY 
New Residential Construction  Housing Starts    February  2018
Single family  for January were not revised and stayed at 877 000  February starts increased month over month by 2 9  to 902 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts increased 2 9   representing the smallest annual gain since October  2017 at 1 8  
The uptrend for housing starts looks good to go again with February s small increase off the bottom of the uptrend channel 
Over the last six months  regional year over year changes in starts have exhibited wide dispersion  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each changed  4 5    36 8   8 7   and 24 6  year over year respectively in February  The West delivered very strong growth once again as builders are clearly in a rush to serve a thirsting market  January s 38 0  leap for the West was what I believe by far the largest year over year gain in housing starts for the region in a very long time 
Existing Home Sales   February  2018
The  numbers for February  2018 had a more favorable comparison than the previous month given a year ago sales took a steep dip off what was then a post recession high  The end of a 2 month sales decline softens a bit the alarm bells from my previous Housing Market Review 
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  Sure enough  for February  the National Association of Realtors  NAR  started its report by saying   Despite consistently low inventory levels and faster price growth  existing home sales bounced back in February after two straight months of declines   Still  the NAR attributed February s sales gains to a  seasonal  jump in inventory  Recall that the NAR closed out 2017 by observing that sales could have been better if prices were not so high and inventory more available  Compare February s statement to the frustrations expressed in January s report 

The utter lack of sufficient housing supply and its influence on higher home prices muted overall sales activity in much of the U S  last month The underproduction of single family homes over the last decade has played a predominant role in the current inventory crisis that is weighing on affordability  

The two month decline in sales made the spike in November almost look like an anomaly  February s rebound now makes November look more like the top of the next range in sales  The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 54M were up 3 0  month over month from 5 38M in sales for January  no revisions   Year over year sales increased 1 0  but did not break the current trend of decelerating existing home sales 

The decline in existing home sales is replaced with a hope that the pattern has at least stabilized 
The share of sales going to first time buyers stayed at 29   This share was also 29  in November and was 31  a year ago  Recall that September was the first time in two years where the share dropped below 30   The NAR warned that

Realtors  in several markets note that entry level homes for first timers are hard to come by  which is contributing to their underperforming share of overall sales to start the year 

The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35   The NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 15  of homes in February  down from 17  in January  Investor sales averaged a share of 15  in 2017 and 14  in 2016 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 33rd straight month  Inventory increased from January to February by 4 6   a second straight monthly increase  In the NAR s previous press conference it noted that inventory  always  increases after the holidays  Again  the NAR attributed the monthly inventory increase to seasonal factors  Recall that during its June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  The supply crisis continues to run deep at 3 4 months of supply at the current sales rate 
The 1 59M homes for sale represented a 8 1  decrease from the previous February  The string of year over year declines is remarkable  for example  starting from 2016 August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   May  8 4   June  7 1   July  9 0  August  6 5   September  6 4   October  10 2   November  9 7   December  10 3   January  9 5  
These are the declines of an increasingly dysfunctional market that  as the NAR continues to imply  is driving prices to levels that will be hard to sustain without a dramatic improvement in the financial standing of potential home buyers 
For February  unseasonably cold and snowy weather hindered sales in the Northeast and the Midwest  The West and South made up the difference and then some  Northeast  7 2   Midwest no change  South 3 4   West 2   As usual  regional sale fluctuations had no relationship to the on going price run ups  Indeed  inventory improvements did not prevent price hikes  All regions logged notable to substantial year over year jumps in their median price  Northeast 3 6   Midwest 4 5   South 5 4   West 9 6  
February s 5 9  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home delivered the 72nd consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  241 700 is slightly up from January s  240 500  The last record median price was set in August at  253 500 
Single family sales increased 4 2  on a monthly basis and increased on a yearly basis by 1 8   The median price of  243 400 was up 5 9  year over year 
The NAR did not provide an update on the  apparent  impact of tax reform on existing home sales 

New single family home sales in November essentially confirmed a tremendous resurgence in new home sales that was synchronized with a resurgence of existing home sales  Similar to existing home sales  new home sales dropped sharply from November s high level  For February  new home sales barely eked forward 
The Census Bureau revised January sales of new single family homes significantly upward from 593 000 to 622 000  This revision switches January s year over year decline of 1 0  to a GAIN of 3 8   New home sales for February decreased 0 6  month over month and increased 0 5  year over year to 618 000 
Year over year gains have regularly hit double digits since 2012  November s 26 6  jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  So the low single digit gains of the last two months are notably disappointing  Moreover  the uptrend from the trough no longer looks solid  In the coming months  I will continue looking for signs that new home sales have stalled out 
November s surge to a new post recession high in new home sales is increasingly looking like an anomaly given the Spring selling season is starting with no fresh momentum 
Source  US  Bureau of the Census  New One Family Houses Sold  United States  HSN1F   retrieved from FRED    April 1  2018 
In September  new home sales were strong enough to plunge inventory from 6 1 months of supply to 5 0 months  October s inventory slipped slightly to 4 9 months of supply  The exceptionally strong sales volume of November pushed inventory to 4 6 months of supply  December s pullback sent inventory jumping back to 5 7 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  so the market s recent unbalance came to an abrupt end in December  February s inventory stood at 5 9 months 
Because new home sales jumped in October  I was surprised that the median price of a new home actually fell 3 3  from September  For November  the median fell slightly from October to  318 700  a 1 2  year over year gain  In December  the median price jumped to  335 400  a 2 4  year over year gain  January s median price of  323 000 was a decline from December but still a 2 5  year over year gain  February s median price of  326 800 is a year over year surge of 9 7   The average price declined 1 6  so there was clearly a relative jump in lower priced homes 
On a regional basis  new home sales were divergent again  After a string of very strong gains since August  the Northeast finally ran out of gas in January with a 44 2  year over year plunge  For February the Northeast returned to gains with an 8 8  jump  The Midwest decreased 8 1   The South eked out a 0 6  year over year gain  The West cooled off from January s blistering 33 2  year over year gain to gain 3 1  year over year for February 
If not for the previous month s dour set of data  I would not have thought much of March s slight decline in the Housing Market Index  HMI   Even at 70  the HMI is still higher than it was for most of 2017  Still  I could not help notice that one of the components is diverging sharply from the others 
The Traffic of Prospective Buyers dropped from 54 to 51 and reversed all its gains since November  2017  The other two components have stalled a bit  but both are well above their low points in November  This could be an early sign of waning demand right in the middle of the important Spring selling season  This kind of dip last happened three years ago  but all three components moved together  I am on alert 
The NAHB was optimistic as usual  Leaning on the fundamentals of a strong economy  the NAHB caveated its concerns 

 builders are reporting challenges in finding buildable lots  which could limit their ability to meet this demand  Managing construction costs and future sales prices will be a key challenge in medium term as costs associated with both land development and home construction continue to increase 


While consumer sentiment jumped to a new 14 year high  the components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  stalled and declined 
The drop in the HMI is a little less ominous given the entirety of the loss came from the Midwest region  The other three regions each increased from February to March  The Northeast and the South each gained one point while the West gained two 
Parting thoughts
While I wring my hands about a worsening picture for the housing market and home builders  California still stands out as a bastion of strength  The NAR cited  at the top of its list for growth  Californian regions were four of these metropolitan areas  Housing starts are running at a blistering pace in California to keep up with the demand  Still  the construction activity remains insufficient  For example  State Senator Scott Wiener is pushing an aggressive  that would tightly constrain the ability of cities to reject housing developments 
Wiener s bill gives   the state more power over land use within a half mile of major transit stops or a quarter mile of bus lines to create a more developer friendly environment for new housing   It   would establish a uniform statewide standard for housing in transit rich zones and prevent cities from blocking construction of new multifamily apartment buildings based on height or density  
It is a bold plan that is meeting timid response from Californian Democratic candidates for governor and outright opposition from the Republican candidates  Not surprisingly  local communities are speaking up against the bill 
The bill is part of many efforts to solve a growing crisis of housing availability and affordability in the state  California suffers from a classic problem of communities shutting the door to new growth for the sake of insulating existing residents 
Meanwhile  a booming economy continues bringing new workers who put more and more strain on the tightly constrained housing supply  Something has to give  California could either be the gunk the slows down the growth of home builders OR it could be the floodgate that keeps business booming for years to come  This quote from KB Homes  conference call   from Seeking Alpha  says it all 

 we re less than half of what we once were  You ve seen a lot of the media coverage on the housing shortage in the state 
The governor and a lot of the mayors have put a stake in the ground that they re going to increase units built by 100 000 a year  I don t know how they d do it  but we d love to see it and help them get there  It s our backyard and it s where we have our most seasoned teams  So  we re nowhere near close to saturation in this state  I think we could double from where we are today  and we d still have upside

130104,351619,KBH,Riding Renewed Market Sentiment  LGIH Soars Into Strong Sales Report,opinion,"The ink just dried on my last Housing Market Review  In that piece I lamented the on going lagging performance of home builders and stagnating housing housing data  and thus concluded that it was time to call an end to the seasonal trade on home builders  Just two days later  home builders surged upward in sympathy with  from Lennar  NYSE LEN  which gained 10 0  on the day 


The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  closed below 200DMA support for just one day  Wednesday s 4 7  run up took ITB right to 50DMA resistance and another important test 
This surge of optimism provided a turbo boost to LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  which was up next to report results  Likely in anticipation of redeeming results  the market sent LGIH rocketing higher by 8 6   LGIH erased the losses of the past two days and likely confirmed support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  

LGI Homes  LGIH  rebounded smartly off 50DMA support and closed at a  marginally  new 2  month high 
In the after hours   that were as impressive as ever  The results were stellar 

  599 homes closed in March 2018  up from 365 home closings in March 2017  representing year over year growth of 64 1   The Company ended the first quarter of 2018 with 1 244 home closings  a 63 5  increase over 761 home closings during the first quarter of 2017  

Business is still booming for LGIH  These results set the stock up for a strong run into the next earnings report  LGIH is now again a  builder of interest  for buying on the dips  It already recaptured my eye as the  last builder standing  with its resilience and large out performance 
I earlier targeted KB Home  NYSE KBH  as my only new home builder to buy going forward based on its strong earnings report  I executed that plan today as soon as I recognized the robust reaction to LEN s earnings  KBH s prospects for holding 200DMA support dramatically improved with its 4 8  gain  Like ITB  it still faces an important test of resistance from its declining 50DMA 
I also put a hold on liquidating my other housing related holdings  The firming of 200DMA supports came just in time

130139,351654,KBH,Bull Run To Continue In Q2  5 Top Ranked Growth Picks,opinion,After witnessing exponential rise throughout 2017  U S  stock markets have entered into correction territory in the first quarter of 2018  Market volatility reared its ugly face in February due to high inflationary expectations that aggravated in March primarily due to President Trump s tariff policies and the tech stock plunge  which occurred due to certain company specific issues However  strong economic fundamentals of the United States suggest that the recent volatility may be transitory and that markets will continue their uptrend  Strong consumer and business sentiments together with business friendly policies and solid earnings should pave the way for a bull run in stock markets in the second quarter of 2018  Consequently  it makes sense to pick good growth stocks to enrich your portfolio Solid Earnings MomentumEarnings momentum is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018 buoyed by strong economic fundamentals  Total earnings of the S P 500 index is expected to be up 15 9  from the same period last year backed by 7 3  year over year growth in revenues Moreover  for the second quarter of 2018  total earnings for the S P 500 index are projected to be up 17 9  from the year earlier level driven by 7 2  higher revenues   Read More   Trade War Fears OverblownOn Mar 9  President Trump imposed tariffs of 25  on steel 10  on aluminum  This was shortly followed by another  60 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese imports   Investors feared that the planned U S  trade actions would likely trigger a trade war  hurting the domestic economy However  newly introduced tax reforms and deregulation policies are likely to more than offset the cost of tariffs  The corporate tax rate was lowered from 35  to 21   Moreover  repatriation of income will be taxed 8  to 15 5   instead of the current 35   And if this not encouraging enough for business  Trump has also promised removing 75  of the regulations during his tenure  His business friendly policies ought to help the economy grow over the long run Healthy Consumer   Business Confidence For March 2018  the Conference Board s

130168,351683,KBH,January s Housing Market Review  Breakdown,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in December  2017 for November  2017  At the time  the iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  was still recovering from a small dip caused by an earnings report from Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  that disappointed the market  Housing data were strong and pointed to on going bullishness  January launched with strength  and ITB out performed the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   until January 25th 
ITB fell from new 10 year highs while the S P 500 surged to a new all time high the next day  Everything fell apart from there  By the end of January  I was salivating over a dip that I previously assumed would not come anytime soon  In another few days  I was writing about the relative under performance of consumer plays including ITB  I became more wary as ITB confirmed a breakdown from its uptrending 50 day moving average  DMA   The breakdown is undeniable now as the entire stock market suffers a large upheaval 
Home builders weakened just ahead of the stock market s sell off  The breakdown iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  took prices right back to November s angst over tax reform 
I found a few bargains in the last Housing Market Review  Unrelenting strength in home builder stocks made me ratchet down my expectations for how much trading I would do for the current cycle 

  the relentless march higher in the price of homes looms as the biggest threat to the health and balance of the market  These out sized price gains are on a slow collision course with higher mortgage rates  Adjustments in the tax incentives for housing will not help and could further exacerbate the issue   of home buying   For these reasons  I will not be as aggressive as usual in buying the dips as I normally would during this season  I will likely stay content with the current small portfolio and trade call options in ITB as the primary way to buy into any dips  

Now the sector is littered with bargains  I am assuming of course the fundamental story for housing has not changed especially from the demand side  The data from January contain few signs of potential change  As long as rates stabilize soon  my buy the dip strategy should deliver a large payoff when the Spring selling season relieves investor angst  However  I think the technical damage in housing related stocks is severe enough to suggest that the recent multi year highs will hold as a top for perhaps the rest of the year 
With a deeper dip in home builder stocks  I got back to accumulating select stocks  I am prepared to do one more tranche of buying focused on shares if ITB retests its 200DMA  Since the last Housing Market Review I have initiated or accumulated larger positions in Meritage Homes  MTH  shares and calls  Lennar  NYSE LEN  calls  KB Homes  NYSE KBH  calls  ITB calls  and Five Point Holdings  NYSE FPH  shares 
Here are some key charts that are of greatest interest to me right now  the upside potential in most of these stocks is substantial given the extent of the current pullbacks and the reversals of breakouts and post earnings gains  

KB Home  KBH  continues to sell off nearly non stop from the second day of its post earnings response 


Lennar  LEN  bounced sharply off 200DMA support  It looks like another test is coming up 


Toll Brothers  TOL  recovered well from its post earnings gap down  Now it trades at post earnings lows and hovers just above its 200DMA support 


PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  sold off after its last earnings report and now faces a 200DMA test 


Regional builder Century Communities  CCS  finished reversing its post earnings gains with a bounce above 200DMA support 


So much for an imminent recovery for M D C  Holdings  NYSE MDC   The stock looks like its has topped out after a fresh 50 200DMA breakdown 


Meritage Homes  NYSE MTH  is struggling to hold onto 200DMA support 


Tri Pointe Group  TPH  bounced sharply off 200DMA support 

The media headlines on housing starts were all about the declines  However  starts for single family homes gained year over year  The Northeast was the only region which experienced a year over year decline  and the West clocked a double digit gain  So  I was not surprised that the stock of home builders barely moved on the data release that day 
Single family housing starts for November were revised upward from 930 000 to 948 000  December starts decreased month over month by 11 8  to 836 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts increased 3 5   representing a sharp slowdown from November s 13 5  blistering year over year gain 

Housing starts fell steeply from November to December  but the overall uptrend from the lows remained well intact

After three months of non dispersed regional changes  dispersion returned for the last four months  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each changed  19 0   1 6   2 2   and 13 7  year over year respectively in December  The West delivered very strong growth once again as builders are clearly in a rush to serve a thirsting market 
   December  2017
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  For November  the NAR delivered a twist by distinguishing between the upper end and the rest of the market to help explain how sales can surge despite the parallel relentless increase in prices  The NAR closed out the year observing that sales could have been better if prices were not so high and inventory more available 

 Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note  but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi year streak of exceptional job growth  which ignited buyer demand At the same time  market conditions were far from perfect  New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly  and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country  These two factors ultimately muted what should have been a stronger sales pace  

For January 2017  existing home sales rose to levels not seen since February  2007  In February 2017  existing home sales dropped sharply and then rebounded sharply in March to a new post recession high  Sales declined through the summer and convinced me that the top was in for the year  November proved me wrong with existing home sales climbing to a new 11 year high  For December  existing home sales declined off that high 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 57M were down 3 1  month over month from 5 78M in sales for November  revised down from 5 81M   Year over year sales increased 1 1  which put the growth pattern back on the edge of the deceleration that was in place from April through October  November 15 4   December 0 7   January 3 8   February 5 4   March 5 9   April 1 6   May 2 7   June 0 7   July 2 1   August 0 2   September  1 5   October  0 9   November 3 8   The prospects for the Spring selling season still look good  Note that the impact of tax reform remains a wildcard as the NAR remains concerned 

  improving the new tax law is a top priority for Realtors  in 2018  Especially in high cost  high taxed markets  there s still big concern that the overall structure of the final bill diminishes the tax benefits of homeownership in a way that would adversely affect home values and sales over time As the housing market adjusts to the new law  Realtors  will be listening to their clients and communicating to lawmakers ways to ensure owning a home is truly incentivized in the tax code  


Existing home sales came down sharply off a multi year high

The share of sales going to first time buyers jumped backed to 32  from 29  in November  This share was also 32  a year ago  Recall that September was the first time in two years where the share dropped below 30   This return of first time buyers throws doubt into the NAR s claim in the previous report that investors are crowding out first time homebuyers  The NAR left this factor out when describing the challenges faced by first time homebuyers 

 Rising wages and the expanding economy should lay the foundation for 2018 being the turning point towards an uptick in sales to first time buyers However  if inventory conditions fail to improve  higher mortgage rates and prices will further eat into affordability and prevent many renters from becoming homeowners  

The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35   The NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 16  of homes in December  Investor sales averaged a share of 15  in 2017 and 14  in 2016  Since these sales increased month over month alongside an increase in first time homebuyer share  it is even more difficult to argue that investors are crowding out first timers 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 31st straight month  During November s press conference  the NAR noted that October set a record low absolute and relative inventory level across all Octobers since data collection started in 1999  Recall that during the June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  The supply crisis just deepened as the 3 2 months of supply at the current sales rate represents the lowest level of inventory since the NAR started tracking the data in 1999 
The 1 48M homes for sale represented a 10 3  decrease from the previous December and an 11 4  decrease from November s 1 67M  The string of year over year declines is remarkable  for example  starting from 2016 August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   May  8 4   June  7 1   July  9 0  August  6 5   September  6 4   October  10 2   and November  9 7   These are the declines of an increasingly dysfunctional market that  as the NAR continues to imply  is driving prices to levels that will be hard to sustain without a dramatic improvement in the financial standing of potential home buyers 
For November  the regional areas experienced sales pivoting around flatline  Northeast  2 6   Midwest 1 5   South 3 1   West  0 8   As usual  regional sale fluctuations had no relationship to the on going price run ups  All regions logged substantial year over year jumps in their median price  Northeast 3 0   Midwest 7 8   South 5 8   West 7 3  
December s 5 8  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home delivered the 70th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  246 800 is slightly down from November s  248 000  The last record median price was set in August at  253 500 
Single family sales declined 2 6  on a monthly basis and increased on a yearly basis by 1 0   The median price of  248 100 was up 5 8  year over year 
New single family home sales in November essentially confirmed a tremendous resurgence in new home sales that was synchronized with a resurgence of existing home sales  Similar to existing home sales  new home sales dropped sharply from November s high level  Reassuringly  year over year performance  and thus the uptrend  remained strong 
The Census Bureau revised November sales of new single family homes downward from 733 000 to 689 000  a third consecutive month with a significant downward revision as I expected   New home sales for December decreased 9 3  month over month but still jumped 14 1  year over year to 625 000  Even if the Census Bureau issues yet another large downward revision  these numbers confirm the bull run in new home sales continues  Year over year gains have regularly hit double digits since 2012  November s 26 6  jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  For 2017  builders sold 608 000 new homes  an 8 3  year over year increase from 2016 

New home sales came off a tremendous November surge  The uptrend remains intact

In September  new home sales were strong enough to plunge inventory from 6 1 months of supply to 5 0 months  October s inventory slipped slightly to 4 9 months of supply  The exceptionally strong sales volume of November pushed inventory to 4 6 months of supply  December s pullback sent inventory jumping back to 5 7 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  so the market s recent unbalance came to an abrupt end in December 
Because new home sales jumped in October  I was surprised that the median price of a new home actually fell 3 3  from September  For November  the median fell slightly from October to November s  318 700  a 1 2  year over year gain  In December  the median price jumped to  335 400  a 2 4  year over year gain 
On a regional basis  new home sales were much less divergent than in November  The Northeast cooled off relatively with a 10 8  year over year gain  compare to 65 2  for August  54 8  for September  64 7  for October  and 53 3  for November   The Midwest was the outlier with a 3 1  drop  The South jumped 15 2  year over year  With a 18 8  year over year gain  the West was the one region to perform closely to November s performance  22 8   
Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index  January  2018
In March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high at 71  For the remainder of the year  the HMI hovered just under that 12 year high  December s reading of 74 blasted the ceiling to send HMI to a level not seen since July  1999  In January  the HMI dropped to 72  still higher than it was for most of 2017  The NAHB expressed that on going enthusiasm for the housing market 

 Builders are confident that changes to the tax code will promote the small business sector and boost broader economic growth Our members are excited about the year ahead  even as they continue to face building material price increases and shortages of labor and lots  

The drop in the HMI was mostly driven by a 4 point drop in the traffic of prospective buyers to 54  The NAHB described the drop as minor  but I disagree  Since this HMI component soared from 50 to 58 in December  the disagreement is not a big deal  Since 2004  the traffic of prospective buyers spent very little time above 50  So even with January s drop  home buyers are clearly very bullish 

The Housing Market Index  HMI  was mainly weighed down by a large drop in the traffic of prospective buyers  Still  sentiment remains very strong across the board 
In the last Housing Market Review  I concluded from the recent history of regional HMI that a large pullback in the West would drag down the overall HMI  The Midwest turned out to be the culprit as it plunged from 76 to 69  The West only dropped from 84 to 83  The South slid from 75 to 72  The Northeast soared from 53 to 62  but it was clearly not enough 
Parting thoughts The seasonally strong period for housing stocks is no longer on a strong footing thanks to the sell off in financial markets  Still  I am treating this pullback as the buying opportunity I thought I would not get this year 
California  particularly the San Francisco Bay Area  remains on my  close watch  list  As I noted in the last Housing Market Review  all the negatives of the housing recovery are converging there  A true housing crisis is in full swing with limited supply causing severe imbalances  For example  in Mountain View  CA  city officials rolled out a trial program to deliver sewage services to people parked on the streets in RVs  Recreational Vehicles   This move implies city officials have accepted a new reality in the growing housing crisis in the Bay Area  Whether it is limited supply and or lack of affordability  a growing number of workers are going to extreme lengths to make ends meet 
Some people are outright giving up on the Bay Area  Redfin s fourth quarter report on migration patterns  based on data from over a million users searching for housing on Redfin s platform  suggested that out migration from the Bay Area continues even as the region grows  Most interesting in this report is that Redfin claims that tax reform has surfaced as a driver for migration from expensive  high tax rate areas to more affordable locations  this observation runs counter to the reassurances from builders like Toll Brothers 

 The fourth quarter of 2017 saw people in expensive  high tax coastal markets like San Francisco  New York  Los Angeles  search for homes in metros like Sacramento  Phoenix  Las Vegas  and Nashville where taxes are lower and housing is more affordable  This is a continuation of a trend we saw throughout the past year  but what was new last quarter was that the topic of taxes and tax reform came in conversations Redfin agents had with people looking to move away from the aforementioned coastal markets and into fast growing mid tier metros  We expect that in 2018  this migration pattern will intensify as tax reform becomes a reality and more people choose to relocate in search of a lower cost of living 
 People leaving coastal hubs in search of affordability has been a consistent trend for the last five years Late last year there was a twist  Many of the popular migration paths that we saw Redfin com users exploring yielded tax benefits along with increased affordability  We expect these trends to continue and will be monitoring them closely in 2018   

Bay Area  escapees  are not abandoning the state  Their most popular destination  for searching  is Sacramento  the state capitol  For example  California cities were the top two destinations for people searching away from San Jose  20 5  to Sacramento and 11 7  to Los Angeles  San Diego was fifth at 4 3   The 10 1  of users who looked at Seattle will likely discover few savings housing costs  In other words  builders in California  and the West in general  are not likely to feel the effects of this net migration  Still  as Redfin notes  these patterns bear watching in 2018 and beyond 
Be careful out there

130170,351685,KBH,February s Housing Market Review  Stalled And Toppy ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in January  2018 for December  2017  At the time  I described the ominous breakdown of the iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB   but I was not yet ready to connect the dots on the bearish implications  I am now 
ITB has continued its breakdown by first severely underperforming the stock market s rally from oversold conditions and now closing at a fresh 4 month low 
The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  managed to bounce off support at its 200 day moving average  DMA  but how long can this support last 
While housing related stocks were able to power through higher rates and expectations of higher rates  investor sentiment has now turned sour  It seems investors are preparing for a much less favorable rate environment  Risk tolerances seem to be shrinking and turning against home builders  During February  several home builders reported earnings and almost none were received favorably 
The most telling churn came from Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  which rallied at first in response to its earnings report but then ended the day down 5 1   The pattern was a double whammy as it confirmed resistance at the 50 day moving average  DMA  and created a bearish engulfing pattern  Like ITB  TOL bounced off its 200DMA support  but I have little expectation that the selling ends here 

Toll Brothers  TOL  quickly lost over 10  from its post earnings intraday high  If support fails at the 200DMA  TOL has little support until last summer s consolidation between  37 and  41 
The housing data in February failed the cause as well  Home builder sentiment held its own  Housing starts gained but are at the bottom of the uptrend  More importantly  sales of existing and new homes faltered notably with existing home sales confirming a deceleration trend  With stocks and data waning  I am warily noting how the current heights of sentiment align with the peak of sentiment before the housing market topped during the last cycle 
This is the point where I should start planning my exit from profitable seasonal trades on home builders  Instead  most of the trades have effectively failed this time around  So I have gone from an excited expectation to a somber realization  I thought the sell off in home builders presented me with the buying opportunity I did not think would happen this year 
Now I am increasingly accepting the possibility that home builders have topped out for the year  Whether this top is THE top for the cycle depends greatly on the macro environment  If economic growth continues to print strong numbers  I think home builders will look a lot less risky  If economic growth falters  home builder stocks will surely be considered an immediate and on going source of funds 
Single family housing starts for December were revised upward from 836 000 to 846 000  January starts increased month over month by 3 7  to 877 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts increased a healthy 7 7   representing a marked improvement from December s 3 5  year over year gain 
 
January  2018 housing starts stayed close to the uptrend 
Over the last five months  regional year over year changes in starts have exhibited wide dispersion  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each changed 11 9    12 4   2 0   and 38 0  year over year respectively in January  The West delivered very strong growth yet again as builders are clearly in a rush to serve a thirsting market  I believe this is by far the largest year over year gain in housing starts for the West in a very long time 
The existing home sales numbers for January  2018 had a tough comparison given a year ago sales hit a post recession high  slightly surpassed in 2017 by March and December sales   Moreover  the month over month decline in December closed out the year on a downer and put pressure on the January number to nullify some of the negativity  January failed to deliver relief on the message 
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  For November  the NAR delivered a twist by distinguishing between the upper end and the rest of the market to help explain how sales can surge despite the parallel relentless increase in prices  The NAR closed out the year observing that sales could have been better if prices were not so high and inventory more available  To describe the dynamics behind January s sales decline  the NAR referenced both the lack of inventory and the affordability problem caused by the scarcity 

 The utter lack of sufficient housing supply and its influence on higher home prices muted overall sales activity in much of the U S  last month Another month of solid price gains underlines this ongoing trend of strong demand and weak supply  The underproduction of single family homes over the last decade has played a predominant role in the current inventory crisis that is weighing on affordability 
It s very clear that too many markets right now are becoming less affordable and desperately need more new listings to calm the speedy price growth  

During the press conference  the NAR further highlighted the point by contrasting over 5 years the 41  increase in the median price versus the 12  increase in wages 
Strangely enough  the NAR pointed to January s jump in new home construction and high confidence among home builders as potential positives on the horizon  As the data above show  the absolute value of starts is still at the bottom of the current range of the uptrend  If January s increase in starts shows promise  there were several months in 2017 that should have drawn outright excitement  Yet  this is the first time in at least recent reports where the NAR looked upon the activity in home construction with such optimism  Similarly  builder optimism was very high through most of 2017 and should have already provided hope for the NAR 

  there s hope that the tide is finally turning  There was a nice jump in new home construction in January and homebuilder confidence is high  These two factors will hopefully lay the foundation for the building industry to meaningfully ramp up production as this year progresses  

For January 2017  existing home sales rose to levels not seen since February  2007  In February 2017  existing home sales dropped sharply and then rebounded sharply in March to a new post recession high  Sales declined through the summer and convinced me that the top was in for the year  November proved me wrong with existing home sales climbing to a new 11 year high  For December  existing home sales declined off that high  The continued decline in December makes the spike in November almost look like an anomaly 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 38M were down 3 2  month over month from 5 56M in sales for December  revised marginally down from 5 57M   Year over year sales decreased 4 8  which plunged the existing home sales back into the deceleration that was in place from April through October  2017 and may have started from March  2015 with a trend of lower highs  
Sales growth for existing homes continued its choppy decline 

Existing home sales plunged toward 2017 s low 
The share of sales going to first time buyers dropped back to 29  from 32  in December  This share was also 29  in November and was 33  a year ago  Recall that September was the first time in two years where the share dropped below 30   So perhaps the NAR s claim two reports ago that investors are starting to crowd out first time homebuyers has some credence after all  Recall what the NAR said  about the prospects for first timers 

 Rising wages and the expanding economy should lay the foundation for 2018 being the turning point towards an uptick in sales to first time buyers However  if inventory conditions fail to improve  higher mortgage rates and prices will further eat into affordability and prevent many renters from becoming homeowners  

The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35   The NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 17  of homes in January  Investor sales averaged a share of 15  in 2017 and 14  in 2016 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 32nd straight month  Inventory increased from December to January by 4 1   but during its press conference the NAR noted inventory  always  increases after the holidays  Recall that during its June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  The supply crisis continues to run deep at 3 4 months of supply at the current sales rate 
The 1 52M homes for sale represented a 9 5  decrease from the previous December  The string of year over year declines is remarkable  for example  starting from 2016 August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   May  8 4   June  7 1   July  9 0  August  6 5   September  6 4   October  10 2   November  9 7   December  10 3   These are the declines of an increasingly dysfunctional market that  as the NAR continues to imply  is driving prices to levels that will be hard to sustain without a dramatic improvement in the financial standing of potential home buyers 

 The utter lack of sufficient housing supply and its influence on higher home prices muted overall sales activity in much of the U S  last month 
Another month of solid price gains underlines this ongoing trend of strong demand and weak supply  The underproduction of single family homes over the last decade has played a predominant role in the current inventory crisis that is weighing on affordability  

For January  all regions experienced year over year declines in existing home sales  Northeast  7 6   Midwest  3 8   South  1 7   West  9 5   As usual  regional sale fluctuations had no relationship to the on going price run ups  for example  the West has the largest sales decline along with the largest price hike  All regions logged substantial year over year jumps in their median price  Northeast 6 8   Midwest 8 7   South 4 3   West 8 8  
December s 5 8  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home delivered the 70th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  246 800 is slightly down from November s  248 000  The last record median price was set in August at  253 500 
Single family sales declined 3 8  on a monthly basis and decreased on a yearly basis by 4 8   The median price of  241 700 was up 5 7  year over year 
During its press conference  the NAR noted its pleasant surprise at the apparent lack of impact of tax reform on housing sales  Demand and foot traffic remains very high  and realtors even in the Bay Area are not hearing about tax reform as a factor in buying decisions  What COULD further impact inventory is the decision by some homeowners not to list their homes because they do not want to buy their next home at a higher interest rate 

New single family home sales in November essentially confirmed a tremendous resurgence in new home sales that was synchronized with a resurgence of existing home sales  Similar to existing home sales  new home sales dropped sharply from November s high level  While year over year performance  and thus the uptrend  remained strong in December  January s new home sales dropped on both a monthly and annual basis 
The Census Bureau revised December sales of new single family homes upward from 625 000 to 643 000  ending three consecutive months of downward revisions   New home sales for January decreased 7 8  month over month and declined 1 0  year over year to 599 000  Year over year gains have regularly hit double digits since 2012  November s 26 6  jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  So January s slight decline is notable  Moreover  the uptrend from the trough no longer looks solid  In the coming months  I will be looking for signs that new home sales have stalled out  
After two months of declines  new home sales are scraping the bottom of the current uptrend 
In September  new home sales were strong enough to plunge inventory from 6 1 months of supply to 5 0 months  October s inventory slipped slightly to 4 9 months of supply  The exceptionally strong sales volume of November pushed inventory to 4 6 months of supply  December s pullback sent inventory jumping back to 5 7 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  so the market s recent unbalance came to an abrupt end in December  January s inventory increased further to 6 1 months 
Because new home sales jumped in October  I was surprised that the median price of a new home actually fell 3 3  from September  For November  the median fell slightly from October to November s  318 700  a 1 2  year over year gain  In December  the median price jumped to  335 400  a 2 4  year over year gain  January s median price of  323 000 is a decline from December but still a 2 5  year over year gain 
On a regional basis  new home sales were extremely divergent again  After a string of very strong gains since August  the Northeast finally ran out of gas with a 44 2  year over year plunge  The Midwest gained 2 7   The South dropped 10 9  year over year  The West took over the lead spot with a very strong 33 2  year over year gain 
While housing data stalled across the board  home builders remained extremely confident  In January  the HMI dropped to 72 from 74  still higher than it was for most of 2017  The HMI remained steady at 72 in February  The NAHB expressed an enthusiasm that was very similar to January s 

 Builders are excited about the pro business political climate that will strengthen the housing market and support overall economic growth  

Although HMI stayed flat  the component for the Single Family  SF  Detached Next Six Months managed to increase 2 points  At 80  this component was last this high in June  2005  This was at the very peak of sentiment  The HMI was even 72 at this point  If the housing data fail to regain their previous momentum  I strongly suspect home builder sentiment will quickly peak around these levels again 
 
The components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  remain strong with the SF Detached Six Months breaking out to a near 13 year high  Consumer sentiment also staged a sharp rebound in February 
In the December Housing Market Review  I concluded from the recent history of regional HMI that a large pullback in the West would drag down the overall HMI  The West did not decline in January  but it did plunge in February from 83 to 77  Yet  the aggregate HMI stayed flat  The December January surge in sentiment now looks like an anomaly as the West returned to its average for 2017  The Northeast also declined  from 60 to 56   The Midwest gained from 69 to 70 while the South stayed flat at 73  It seems the South must have an outsized influence on the HMI 
Parting thoughts
I have not completely given up on making successful trades on home builders during the Spring selling season  The return of automatic skepticism has made investors turn blind to some truly good news that could lead to great trades and investments in a positive scenario 
For example  LGI Homes  Inc   NASDAQ LGIH  RAISED its guidance and the stock still sold off  LGIH is now down 27 6  from its all time high just two months ago  to start the year   LGIH was of course red hot last year with a 161 2  gain  so this bad start to the year is like an overdue cooling  Valuation is also not a friend to LGIH as it is very rich compared to its peers with a 2 8 price book ratio  Fortunately  its forward P E is only 7 9 and price sales is a very reasonable 1 1  I will be watching LGIH closely  I am willing to buy it on strength if it can survive the current test of its 200DMA support 
 
LGI Homes  Inc   LGIH  confirmed 50DMA resistance by making a lower low  Can the 200DMA hold as support and provide a base for the next breakout 
Century Communities  NYSE CCS  was one of the few home builders to get an initial positive response to earnings  Unfortunately  CCS could not generate enough momentum to avoid the recent 50DMA breakdown that managed to close the post earnings gap  In a  worst case  scenario I can see CCS going through months of consolidation between  27 and  32 

Century Communities  CCS  could not break through 50DMA resistance but at least it has not made a lower low 

Meritage Homes  NYSE MTH  is still of interest to me  I will write about its earnings report in a future post  MTH increased its focus on first time buyers with a late recognition of the buying potential of this segment  However  if economic growth begins to falter like the home builder stocks  MTH will find itself turning with the wind just as the wind shifts direction  Yet  I cannot resist as MTH s valuation is amazingly attractive for a company that just reported strong financial results  forward P E 7 6  price sales 0 5  and price book 1 1  The last two ratios resemble a stock mired in an economic slump 

Meritage Homes  MTH  is one of several home builder stocks making a bearish breakdown below 200DMA support  So while the stock looks incredibly cheap  I am not rushing to add to current positions 
KB Home  NYSE KBH  has completely broken down from the parabolic post earnings move in January  Sellers have barely relented along the way to a 27 8  pullback from its 10 year high  KBH confirmed 50DMA resistance with a lower low  The stock s breakout from the first announcement of tax reform is now history  Yet  KBH had a banner 2017 with a 102 1  gain  So  like LGIH  KBH s sharp sell off is not yet a big deal relative to recent gains  Still  it needs to survive a potential test of 200DMA support to avoid tumbling to the next range of likely support from  22 to  24 where KBH gapped after September earnings 

KB Home  KBH  has suddenly fallen from favor as a test of 200DMA support looms

130197,351712,KBH,KB Home Reverses Post Earnings Gain  Delivers Buying Opportunity,opinion,"KB Home  NYSE KBH  reported earnings last week on January 10  2018  The reaction the next day was outright startling  The stock gapped up and did not stop rallying until it finished with a 12 3  gain and a new 10 1 2 year high 
Post earnings  KB Home  KBH  gapped up to a 10 1 2 year high with a 12 3  gain  Sellers regained control after that and have almost closed the entire gap 
I was so taken aback that I checked on the historical data to get some context  It turns out KBH s post earnings gain was its fourth largest since at least 1997  Moreover  the 42 4  gain between earnings   since the close after September  2017 earnings to the close before January  2018 earnings   was the sixth largest since at least 1997  Combined  KBH s one quarter earnings performance was truly historic and one of the strongest in recent years 

The post earnings price action for KB Home  KBH  was historic 
Given this historic response  I thought KBH delivered historic and outstanding earnings performance  While indeed strong  KBH basically hit its guidance with a little room to spare  The market s reaction was like a late recognition that KBH would hit its goals  Management provided strong but reasonably incremental forward guidance for the coming year  In other words  KBH has returned to the good graces of investors as a consistent earnings performer  This time around  the trading action looks like a buyer s panic in the face of this acknowledged reality  Yet  the buying panic exhausted itself in the short term as sellers and profit takers were able to gain control and nearly reverse the entire post earnings gain 
I used this pullback as an opportunity to make a fresh trade on KBH  I assumed that the monster performance in the past quarter effectively soaked up much of the short term buying interest in KBH  So  I purchased a calendar spread going short February calls and long April calls  I expect the February calls to expire worthless and thus pay for a good portion of the longer term play that I want to make going into the Spring selling season and to make a play on  in general  If KBH sells off past the gap and retests the uptrending support at its 20 day moving average  DMA   I may start adding shares to the trade with an upside price target around the last high 
Despite the 10 1 2 year high and preceding run up  KBH is STILL relatively cheap  especially when compared to the S P 500 and even other home builders  Based on  
Trailing P E  18 91
Forward P E  11 40
Price Sales  0 69
Price Book  1 58
Other home builders have surpassed 2x book and are beyond 1x book  Home builders usually hit 1x book during downturns and troughs in the market cycle  Trading below 1x book is typically a sign of deep skepticism about the business  Indeed  KBH skeptics still abound with 21 8  of stock s float sold short 
Here is a summary of the results that most caught my attention for KBH taken from and the Q A session in  
Annual Revenues
Housing revenues gained 21  to  4 34B 
Home deliveries gained 11  to 10 909 
Annual profits  margins  and cash flow
Homebuilding operating income gained 86 0  to  283 4M
Homebuilding operating income margin  excluding inventory related charges  gained 140 basis points to 7 1  
Net income increased 71 0  to  180 6M  or  65 2  to  1 85 per diluted share
Net operating cash flow increased 172  to  513M  This metric was not explicitly reported   but it was likely negative given net cash and equivalents only increased from  559 0M in 2015 to  592 1M in 2016 
KBH described the drivers of the improvement in gross margins    deliveries from newer  higher margin communities  favorable regional mix and fixed cost leverage on a larger revenue base   In other words  great performance from California in particular 
Investments
 1 52 invested in land acquisition and development for the year ended November 30  2017 
Orders per community and order value KBH s orders per community increased slightly Q4 to 3 4 month 
Regionally  KBH had mixed order performance on an annual basis  The West made incremental gains  The Southwest soared  The Central and Southeast regions took steps back  The West was 46  of KBH s net order value in 2017  The Central region was 28   and the Southwest was 13  
West  28 8  gain in net order value on a 11 9  gain in net orders versus a 27 4  gain in net order value on a 24 8  gain in net orders in 2016 
Southwest  24 6  gain in net order value on a 20 6  gain in net orders versus a 11 4  gain in net order value on a 10 4  gain in net orders in 2016   Las Vegas was particularly strong  
Central  7 9  gain in net order value on a 1 5  gain in net orders versus a 14 0  gain in net order value on a 9 8  gain in net orders in 2016 
Southeast  11 2  drop in net order value on a 9 7  drop in net orders versus a 0 1  drop in net order value on a 4 5  drop in net orders in 2016 
For the Southeast  KBH pointed out that the small year over year gain in net orders in the fourth quarter was the first such gain in  many quarters   KBH reinvested more heavily in the Southeast in 2017 
Tax reform impact
KBH stuck to the updated narrative from home builders about tax reform  it will be a net positive for its business and customers  KBH concluded that a  majority  of individual taxpayers will see lower taxes  observe more jobs in the economy  experience higher confidence  and on balance express higher demand for homes  Management cited reports estimating 80  to 85  of taxpayers will get a lower tax rate  First time buyers in particular will have a little more money in their pockets 
For KBH   a lower tax rate should drive higher earnings  returns and cash flow over the longer term   Jeff Kaminski  KBH EVP and CFO  declared    I don t have any hesitation saying that whatsoever on the tax side  I think it s going to be  across the board  positive  but that s again  my opinion  
Guidance
Homebuilding operating income margin  excluding inventory related charges    Q1 2018  4 3  to 4 7   Full year 2018  7 2  to 7 7  which is above prior guidance 
Housing gross profit margin  excluding inventory related charges    Q1 2018  16 0  to 16 5   an increase of 90 to 140 basis points year over year  Full year 2018  17 2  to 17 7   an increase of 30 to 80 basis points year over year 
KBH explained its incrementally higher expectations given   some nice trends throughout the business  Some of the new communities that we ve opened recently  performing pretty well in accordance with our expectations  and we just gained a little bit more confidence on the back half of the year  
Overall  KBH expects to continue meeting  or exceeding  the targets it laid out in its  Returns Focused Growth Plan   The company has successfully completed year one of that plan

130199,351714,KBH,5 Housing Stocks To Soar  Braving Weak December Home Sales,opinion,Sales of previously owned homes decreased in December 2017  as low inventory is limiting the choice of prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated  Again  unseasonably cold weather also accounted for a bit of the downfall December Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors  NAR   existing home sales slipped 3 6  in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 57 million units from a downwardly revised 5 78 million in November after three straight months of strong increases  Nonetheless  existing home sales  which account for about 90  of U S  home sales  grew 1 1  on a year over year basis during the month Also  December s median sales price grew 5 8  from the comparable period a year ago to  246 800  marking the 70th straight month of year over year gains  For 2017  prices increased 5 8   rising for the sixth straight year Again  inventory continues to slip  leaving less homes for future sales  The supply of existing homes decreased 11 4  from November and 10 3  from the year ago period  It has fallen year over year for 31 consecutive months  As such  it will take only 3 2 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market  according to NAR  This is also the lowest reading since the group began tracking the data in 1999 An Impressive 2017 for HomebuildingAlthough the December housing data were not impressive  the larger picture is overwhelming for 2017  Existing home sales concluded the year with 1 1  gain to 5 51 million units  the highest since 2006  Building permits increased 4 7  and housing starts increased 2 4  in 2017 from the 2016 figure  The  advanced almost 69  in 2017  outperforming the broader market s  S P 500  growth of 19 7  Moreover  January 2018 builders  confidence reading remained in the 70s  signaling that housing demand should continue to grow this year U S  Housing Signaling a Positive 2018 Amid OddsAlthough inventory constraints have been consistently pulling the housing market down  robust demand is keeping the industry alive  This is primarily because of solid labor market that is near full employment Other hurdles such as rising prices owing to the limited land availability are keeping the affordability in check  Again  homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment Market pundits are a shade worried that rising mortgage rates and caps on the deduction for mortgage interest following a recent overhaul of the tax code is likely to slow demand this year  That said  the latest report from the   released on Jan 24  showed applications for loans to buy a home surging last week to their highest level since April 2010  Hence  despite concerns of chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  that are restricting homebuilders to respond to the growing demand to some extent  the overall demand picture remains quite strong  courtesy of strong economic growth and low level of unemployment Investing in the homebuilding industry might sound profitable right now  as it falls

130225,351740,KBH,Buy These 5 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are

shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks As the year winds down  it s clear that one area of winners in 2017 on Wall Street have been the growth stocks  That extends even to small cap growth which has dominated the small cap universe Value  while it is up on the year  hasn t performed as well as the other investing styles Heading into 2018  it s unclear whether value will see a rebound or if growth will take the crown again  Why not plan on both scenarios Finding Value Stocks Using a Basic ScreenOne way value investors can hedge their bets is by buying value stocks that also have growth  This is a very powerful combination  if you can find it Tracey decided to run a screen using just a few metrics to see out the growth component along with value She started with the Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold   By including the Holds that widened the screen as most stocks are found in that category Then she combined it with a PEG ratio under 1 0  A PEG under one usually indicates that a company is undervalued but that it also has growth  It s cheap growth And that s it  Just those two metrics Because she started with a wide screen  she got 148 stocks Here are some of the stocks that caught her eye in some of the industries everyone will be watching in 2018 5 Stocks with PEGs Under 1 01       Diamondback Energy   NASDAQ FANG   has a PEG of just 0 8  The energy sector was ignored by Wall Street in 2017 even though the earnings outlook is much improved over 2016  Will these stocks see big gains in 2018 2      KB Home   NYSE KBH   is still cheap even though shares have soared in 2017  It has a PEG of 0 7 and is expected to grow earnings another 23  in 2018 3      Pulte   NYSE PHM   is another large homebuilder that no one is talking about  Who cares about the homebuilders when you can buy Nvidia  right  But Pulte is also cheap  It has a PEG ratio of 0 9 and is expected to grow earnings by 37  in 2018  Is it too late to get in 4      Royal Caribbean   NYSE RCL   is still producing double digit earnings growth as consumers want  experiences  and travel fits right into that  This cruise company has a PEG of 0 8  Earnings are expected to jump another 15 4  next year 5      Macy s   NYSE M   is one of 9 retailers that came up in the screen  It has bounced off its recent lows  when it was trading with a P E of around 5 0  It now has a P E of 7 6 and a PEG of 0 9  But will earnings rebound next year as well Investors should also take a look at some of the smaller  specialty retailers like The Tile Shop  It has a PEG of 0 8 Remember  to always research the companies before you buy  This was a basic screen with few metrics  It doesn t tell you the whole picture Additionally  the semiconductors were well represented in the screen

One of the top builders in the United States  KB Home delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8 5  last quarter  Also  the company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive beat of 12 7  KB Home is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario  The momentum is expected to continue in 2018  courtesy of an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation However  fourth quarter results might be affected to some extent by the disruptions caused by Hurricane Irma  which had hit Florida in the first week of the company s fourth quarter  As a result  KB Home s divisions had to be kept closed for about a week  The company experienced a shortfall in net orders in September which is likely to result in a slightly negative net order comparables in the fourth quarter  Orders will likely be down mid single digits in the quarter  This shortfall equates to 75 and 125 net orders  However  KB Home still anticipates generating a positive net order in value Let us delve into other factors which are also expected to affect KB Home s performance in the soon to be reported quarter RevenuesKB Home s strategic initiatives  which include increasing community count  achieving higher revenue per community  increasing asset efficiency and return on capital invested  have been paying off since 2015  These initiatives along with overall positive housing momentum are likely to help KB Home post solid fourth quarter results as well KB Home expects homebuilding revenues between  1 3 billion and  1 4 billion in the to be reported quarter  against  1 2 billion in the year ago quarter   This is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog Average selling price is anticipated at around  425 000  430 000  reflecting a year over year increase of about 10   Average selling price is expected to increase as a result of the changing mix of communities  expected proportional mix shift toward the West Coast region and the successful implementation of targeted community and plan specific price increases The company ended the third quarter with a backlog value of  2 1 billion  up 14  from the year earlier period  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for backlog value is projected at  1 7 billion  compared with  1 5 billion in the year ago period  Based on the strong backlog value  KB Home is well positioned for continued top line growth in the fourth quarter as well as 2018 Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in fourth quarter is pegged at  1 4 million  implying a 13 9  increase MarginsKB Home has seen a sequential increase in gross margin so far this year  This has been supported by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher quarterly housing revenues  deliveries from higher margin communities  community specific gross margin improvement action plan and targeted balancing of absorption pace and pricing in its communities Due to these factors  the company is expected to generate a meaningful increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter  The company expects fourth quarter housing gross profit margin in the range of 18  to 18 3   up 115 basis points  bps  year over year SG A RatioSG A expense ratio is expected to improve 20 40 bps sequentially in the fourth quarter  The ratio improved 120 bps last quarter  This significant improvement reflects benefits from the ongoing cost control initiatives and the favorable leverage impact of higher housing revenues For the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 77 cents  This reflects an increase of 91 9  year over year  owing to higher revenues  increased margins and lower SG A expenses  KB Home Price and EPS Surprise     What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that KB Home is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  The

130294,351809,KBH,8 Month High Builders  Confidence In November  Key Picks,opinion,Confidence among homebuilders rose in November to its highest reading in eight months and the second highest since the recession  July 2005   according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  So are the builders shaking off worries associated with the Republican tax plan  At least the latest reading hints at renewed strength in the sector NAHB Chairman Granger MacDonald said   November s builder confidence reading is close to a post recession high   a strong indicator that the housing market continues to grow steadily  Pleasing ProspectsThe index of home builder sentiment rose two points in November to 70 from the previous month  This followed after a rise of four points in October  It is important to note that the index dipped three points in September from August  However  it still remained at a confident level of 64 points as any reading above 50 is considered positive This index primarily reflects builders  perceptions of current single family home sales and sales expectations for the next six months  Notably  two of the total three HMI components gained in November Of the index s three components  current sales conditions rose two points to 77  Buyer traffic increased two points to 50  This is the first time in six months that this component has been in the positive territory  However  sales prediction over the next six months dropped one point to 77 The U S  housing homebuilding outlook remains upbeat for the balance of 2017 and 2018 courtesy of solid economic growth and tight inventory  Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders  confidence is adding to the momentum Per the Commerce Department s first estimate  the U S  economy expanded at a pace of 3  in the third quarter  This represents a marginal decline from the annualized growth rate of 3 1  in the April to June period  the strongest performance since the first quarter of 2015  Moreover  the latest figure represents the best back to back quarters of at least 3  growth since 2014 Again  the U S  economy rebounded from the hurricanes and added 261 000 jobs  the best performance of the Trump administration  Unemployment fell to 4 1   the lowest since December 2000 Hence  with these economic fundamentals in place  the overall homebuilding picture is pretty compelling as we close out 2017 Proposed Republican Tax Bill Pose a RiskApart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  homebuilders continue to struggle with a growing labor shortage  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment  These are restricting homebuilders to respond to growing demand However  they were optimistic post the 2016 presidential election with expectations of easier regulations  which have been adding to builder costs  The recent House Republican tax bill came as a major blow as it will eliminate one of the benefits of ownership for many would be homebuyers The measure would limit the mortgage interest deduction on newly purchased homes at  500 000  This is quite a dramatic shift from the current cap of  1 million  The proposed capping of the mortgage interest deduction could diminish the benefit of the deduction outside of the costly housing markets  The National Association of Realtors said the memo  appears to confirm many of our biggest concerns  Nonetheless  the latest spike in builders  confidence reassures the industry s strength defying the above mentioned woes  The  has outperformed the broader market  S P 500  so far this year despite dampeners  The industry has gained more than 56   compared with the S P 500 index s 15 8  increase  Notably  the homebuilding industry ranks among the top 28  of all the Zacks industries  Housing got off to a solid start this year and the trend is expected to continue

the South  reaching 621 000 units  Additionally  single family construction soared 16 6  last month  This marked its highest level since 2007  Further  Midwest and Northeast reported a surge in residential construction in October  Also  single family home building  which constitutes the largest portion of the housing market  increased 5 3  to reach 877 000 units last month  An increase in housing starts marks the end of a streak of decline for three straight months The biggest challenge for the housing market is low supply  Factors like rising lumber and land costs as well as tight labor supply and shortage of land have been hurting inventory build up  Limited listings and rising prices have also kept home buyers at bay with many postponing their search for the time being

its   Buy   stock recommendations   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Existing Home Sales Rise in October  Will the Rally Last Sales of previously owned homes increased in October for the second straight month  marking the best performance since June  However  low inventory is limiting the choice of prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D R  Horton Inc   Lennar Corporation  Toll Brothers Inc   KB Home  PulteGroup  Inc   escalated yesterday after the release October Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors  NAR   existing home sales increased 2  in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 48 million units from 5 37 million in September  However  sales declined 0 9  from the year ago level  marking the second consecutive year over year decline primarily due to shortage of supply  Moreover  the housing industry is yet to recover from the natural disaster that ravaged parts of Texas and Florida Meanwhile  October s median sales price grew 5 5  from the comparable period a year ago to  247 000  marking the 68th straight month of year over year gains Again  inventory continues to slip  leaving less homes for future sales  The supply of existing homes decreased 3 2  from September and 10 4  from the year ago period  It would take just 3 9 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market  according to NAR  This is also the lowest October reading since the group began tracking the data in 1999 Will the Momentum Continue The U S  housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes in the South  Again  limited land availability is driving prices higher  Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment  These are restricting homebuilders to respond to the growing demand Besides  economists are of the opinion that a tax overhaul could add to the volatility in the market in the coming months  The measure would limit the mortgage interest deduction on newly purchased homes at  500 000  This is quite a dramatic shift from the current cap of  1 million  The proposed capping of the mortgage interest deduction could be damaging to pricier coastal markets that have been showing some strength in sales activity in recent times Despite the above mentioned woes  new residential construction in the United States increased more than expected in October 2017  reinstating strength in the housing industry  Per the latest jointly released report by the U S  Census Bureau and the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  constructions for new homes increased 13 7  in October 2017 to 1 29 million units  seasonally adjusted annual rate  from the prior month  This also marks the biggest surge in 12 months as housing starts witnessed big gains in single family homes and apartments Again  confidence among homebuilders rose in November to its highest reading in eight months to 70 and second highest since the recession  July 2005   according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders   NAHB   and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  Bottom LineThe latest positive housing data undoubtedly reassures the industry s strength courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and the ongoing recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas  Consistent job growth along with seemingly high

130321,351836,KBH,KB Home Builds Rapid Repricing On Californian Foundations ,opinion,"I last wrote about earnings from KB Home  NYSE KBH    While I kept tabs on the stock through   I never set up specific decision points for getting back into the stock 
I finally created a decision point on October 12th when I made a hedged play of call and put options  Given my general bullishness on the housing market  I normally buy call options on home builders  However  the current run up in KBH is so persistent  so strong  and so steep that technical prudence dictated taking seriously the potential for a near term pullback 

KB Home  KBH  has rocketed upward through its upper Bollinger  Band channel 
As the chart above shows  the reaction to KBH s last earnings report on September 28  was swift and decisive  KBH gapped up and broke out above its 50 day moving average  DMA   The next day  KBH set a new 9 year high and a vigorous repricing began  The stock is now at a 9 1 2 year high  Two main themes came from KBH s earnings  1  the unfolding payoff from the company s on going efforts to improve operations and profitability  and 2  the overall impact from the hurricanes in Texas and Florida will be minimal 
My main caution on KBH is its increasing reliance on the strong results and pricing power in the West  especially the San Francisco Bay Area  For example  in Q3  the West Coast represented 32  of homes delivered but a very dominant 53  of homebuilding revenues 

The West Coast region dominates the monetary value of business for KB Home 
This quote from  demonstrates the heavier reliance on California 

 We grew housing revenues to over  1 1 billion as we continue to benefit from our growing scale in California and a larger percentage of our deliveries coming from our highest ASP region  While our overall average selling price in the quarter was up 12  to roughly  411 000  we continue to offer product in locations that appeal to first time buyers who accounted for 53  of our delivery 
Housing revenues were up in three of our four homebuilding regions with year over year increases ranging from 9  in the central region to 47  in the West Coast region  

 During the Q A  KBH further emphasized the strength of the first buyer segment  Management described it as the locus of growing demand that is  very broad  across its markets  
California s results were indeed very solid and KBH projects even stronger performance in the future 

 On a regional basis  our West Coast region produced a 26  increase in net order value on a 10  increase in net orders  an impressive result given how strong our net orders and net order value were in California in the third quarter last year  Market conditions remain favorable  both along the coast as well as the inland area  The Bay Area  in particular  continued to generate excellent results  With a growing community count and continued investment in the region  the West Coast is poised to become an even stronger growth vehicle for us going forward  

KBH further referenced the dominance of California during the question and answer  Q A  period 

  we had a mix shift to California  which is also where   within the quarter we saw the strongest pricing power  the combination of being able to take price  at the same time your mix rotates the higher ASP  If you look at our ASPs in the other regions  they really didn t moved up much more than an incremental increase  And I would say that we are successful in raising price above any direct cost increases that we had  and that s in part why our margins were able to pick up a little bit  

So largely thanks to California  KBH can tell a story of on going improvement over the past year and promise even more going forward 

 Over the last 12 months  we have increased our cash from operations  reduced our debt  and expanded our stockholders  equity by almost  160 million  And with our returns focused growth plan  we expect this trend to continue  We also believe given our backlog that we can sustain the year over year improvement in gross margin for the remainder of 2017 and going into 2018  

Guidance
KBH is building on California for its strong guidance as well 

 Reflecting the strength of our West Coast region s third quarter net order value and expected regional fourth quarter backlog conversion rate  we are projecting an average selling price for the 2017 fourth quarter in the range of  425 000 to  430 000  a year over year increase of about 10   This is the result of a changing mix of communities within our region  an expected proportional mix shift towards our West Coast region and the successful implementation of targeted community and plan specific price increases  

KBH s confidence showed in its  4 5B to  4 9B revenue guidance range for fiscal 2018 whose midpoint is a rounding error away from KBH s 3 year 2019 target of  5B  The projected 20  growth for 2017 adds credence to the confidence given this growth rate well exceeds last year s projection of 11   KBH also achieved its gross margin target one quarter early 
KBH will provide full 2018 guidance and update on its 3 year plan  to 2019  at an investor conference call on November 7  2017 
Impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma Overall  the two big hurricanes that slammed into the U S  through Texas and Florida will have minimal impact on KBH 
Home sales will be deferred and not lost  KBH homes in Texas did not flood given the newer areas have  more advanced drainage system requirements   KBH was back to delivering homes in Texas within a week of the disaster  KBH expects negative comparisons in September  but unaffected areas will likely see increases in demand  While KBH is concerned about potential material and labor shortages  the company has baked in the most likely scenario into its guidance  Where it can  KBH is locking down material and labor  The company claims it has control on the materials it knows will be in short supply as a result of post hurricane rebuilding  lumber  rock  and shingles  So there is potential upside if things turn out not to be as bad as feared 
The repricing KBH soared 8 6  post earnings  Since then  the stock has traded down just two days  This kind of repricing is very bullish and represents a sudden recognition that KBH is was  cheap   Perhaps shorts are also getting out of the way and creating yet more buying pressure  a whopping   Even after this run up   sits at 20 9 trailing P E  12 9 forward P E  0 6 price to sales  and 1 3 price to book  Builders are usually in distress when they trade anything near 1 0 price to book  As a point of comparison  Lennar  NYSE LEN  trades at 1 8 P B and D R  Horton  Inc   NYSE DHI  trades at 2 0 P B  KBH is a buy even up here 
Yet  as I noted at the beginning of this piece  I well recognize that these kinds of run ups are vulnerable to sharp pullbacks  So  I am not changing my strategy to chase KBH  previous buys were done in the middle of sell offs   Moreover  I am keeping the California concentration in mind as a potential risk factor given the growing issues of affordability in the state  At this point  a hedged approach seems best while I await future opportunities to buy the dips 
Next stop  the KBH investor s conference 
Be careful out there

130325,351840,KBH,Here s Why Louisiana Pacific  LPX  Stock Makes A Solid Pick,opinion,Shares of Louisiana Pacific Corporation   NYSE LPX   have lately been riding high  This year  the stock has climbed 50 4   comparing favorably with the 20 7  rally by the  it belongs to Earnings estimates for Louisiana Pacific have exhibited an uptrend  reflecting optimism in the stock s prospects  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s current quarter and current year earnings have moved north by 18 8  and 12 2   respectively  over the past 60 days  The positive earnings estimate revision testifies to the confidence that analysts have in the company and substantiates the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  for the stock  You can see  Let us delve deeper into the other factors which make this stock a lucrative pick Solid Growth ProspectsThe leading manufacturer of quality engineered wood building products has been expanding its product range to accommodate all consumer demand and thereby drive top line  In fact  in its last reported quarter  Louisiana Pacific s net sales increased 19  year over year  The solid top line performance led to a 107 1  increase in its bottom line The solid results were aided by higher demand for products and increased Oriented Strand Board or OSB pricing  Siding and Engineered Wood Product also generated higher revenues with improved pricing Further  the company expects to continue with sustainable improvement projects  including consistent siding growth and instigation of new specialty products in the second half of 2017  The year over year increase in single family starts raises hopes of a profitable second half for the company despite the constraints of labor shortage and lot availability Louisiana Pacific has solid growth prospects as evident from the expected 137 8  year over year earnings growth  significantly higher than the industry s average of 30 8   for the current year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 12 per share Meanwhile  the company s sales are expected to increase 21 3  in the current year compared with the industry s average growth of just 3   Hence  Louisiana Pacific makes for a great pick in terms of growth investment supported by a Growth Score of A Barrier Technology AcquisitionRecently  Louisiana Pacific acquired International Barrier Technology Inc   a company known for manufacturing fire retardant coating used in engineered wood products  The agreement finally closed at  22 million  making Barrier Technology a wholly own subsidiary of Louisiana Pacific In the view of increasing demand for fire resistance products in residential and commercial buildings  the Barrier Technology buyout is expected to prove beneficial for the company  To improve the quality of its engineered wood building products  Louisiana Pacific saw immense potential in Barrier Technology s branded product   LP FlameBlock Fire Rated OSB Sheathing and Blazeguard FR Deck Panel  This particular product is used to make engineered wood fire resistant As per the company  this acquisition will ensure long term support to Louisiana Pacific in terms of investments in FlameBlock market development and product sales Solid VGM ScoreThe company boasts an impressive VGM Score of A  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  In fact  our research

its forward P E ratio  compared with this year s earnings  is 13 5  compared with the industry s 26 1  This indicates a slightly more value oriented path ahead for Louisiana Pacific Other Stocks to

130327,351842,KBH,Is KB Home  KBH  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put KB Home   NYSE KBH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  KB Home has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  KB Home s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that KB Home has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for KB Home stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  KB Home has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  KB Home currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes KB Home a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for KB Home is just 0 8  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  KBH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though KB Home might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives KBH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone up by 3 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in

130356,351871,KBH,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  IShares U S  Home Construction ETF  KB Home  Lennar And PulteGroup,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 10  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Homebuilding  Part 1  including SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  NYSEARCA       iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  BATS   WA ITB        KB Home  NYSE   NYSE KBH        Lennar Corporation  NYSE   NYSE LEN       and PulteGroup  Inc   NYSE   NYSE PHM       Industry  Homebuilding  Part 1Link  For the rest of 2017 and 2018  the homebuilding outlook is quite compelling given historically low mortgage rates  solid economic growth and tight inventory  Consistent job growth as well as seemingly high homebuilders  confidence are adding to the momentum Yet a tight labor market  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are restricting the ability of homebuilders to respond to growing demand  Meanwhile  Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in late August  and Hurricane Irma lashed Florida in early September The two devastating storms have created uncertainty for builders  Despite hurricane related effects and concerns over the chance of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  optimism surrounding the housing market remains unruffled Delving DeeperExisting home sales declined to a one year low in August  per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB  Existing home sales slipped 1 7  last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 35 million  This marks the fourth decline in five months  bringing the annual rate to the lowest level in 12 months  Purchases in Houston dropped 25  year over year  and sales would have been flat excluding the Harvey impact Economists are of the opinion that diminishing data reflects inventory shortage prevailing in the U S  real estate market  This has pushed up average home prices nationwide  In fact  median sales price of existing homes rose 5 6  last month from a year earlier Moreover  total housing inventory declined 6 5  year over year to 1 88 million  marking the 27th consecutive year over year decline  That s only 4 5 month s supply  Investors should note that it is preferable to have about six months of supply for a healthy market August new home sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 560 000  per the latest report from the Commerce Department   the lowest annual rate since December 2016  This was 3 4  lower than a month ago and 1 2  lower than the August 2016 level  The median sales price of new homes sold in August was  300 200  0 4  higher than a year ago Adding to the woes  housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 18 million last month  This is 0 8  down from a revised July estimate of 1 19 million  Nevertheless  August construction starts were 1 4  higher year over year  Single family starts were even stronger  growing 17 1  from a year earlier Meanwhile  building permits  another economic indicator used to determine the health of the housing sector  increased sharply by 5 7  from the previous month with 1 3 million authorizations  Last month s permit total was also 8 3  above the August 2016 level of 1 2 million  According to the Census Bureau data  the areas in Texas and Florida that were devastated by the storms accounted for about 13  of permits issued in the country last year Investors should note that housing starts  permits and completions dropped 4 8   4 1  and 6 2   respectively  in July  New U S  single family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9 4  in July  the lowest level since December 2016 Reaffirming a Positive OutlookIt goes without saying that the latest July August housing data has been dismal  Also  the supply situation in the housing sector will remain an issue in the coming months especially in the hurricane affected areas where focus will be more on rebuilding rather than on constructing new homes Nonetheless  homebuilders remain optimistic given strong economic growth and labor market conditions  and expect post disaster rebuilding efforts to drive demand for new homes next year  Again  demand in the homebuilding industry has been strong and is expected to continue so in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018  Strong employment  income growth  growing interest from first time homebuyers  relatively low mortgage interest rates and low inventory of new and existing homes are some of the factors that have been supporting sustained growth in housing demand As the economy plays an important role in the industry it is important to note that the U S  economy grew faster than anticipated in the second quarter  fastest pace in more than two years  and shows a significant jump from the first quarter s lackluster 1 2  growth  The economy grew at an annual rate of 3 1  in the April June period  the Commerce Department said in its third estimate on Sep 28  Along with this  solid homebuilders  confidence  64 in September  raises optimism about the entire construction sector This is clearly evident from the Zacks Homebuilding Industry s year to date rally of 40 5  versus the 13 7  gain of the S P 500  SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  NYSEARCA      and iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  BATS       the two largest exchange traded funds focusing on homebuilders and related fare  have rallied 19 6  and 36 1   respectively  year to date Let s take a look at why it s worth paying more premium for the stocks in the industry Homebuilding Industry Offers More UpsideBecause of homebuilders  asset driven nature  it makes sense to value these based on price to book ratio  The valuation of the industry looks attractive at present  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P B ratio of 1 83  This is quite cheap when compared with the market at large  as the current P B for the S P 500 is 3 79  Its lower than market positioning calls for upside in the quarters ahead Zacks Industry Rank   PositiveWithin the Zacks Industry classification  homebuilding companies are broadly grouped in the Construction sector  one of 16 Zacks

Zacks Industry Rank page Sector Level Earnings TrendThe Q3 earnings season is gradually gaining steam and investors should be content with the expectation of the broader construction sector  Overall  earnings are on the growth track this quarter and construction seems to be one of the stand out sectors  Of the construction companies in the S P 500 cohort  15 4  have already reported their Q3 results The sector saw quarterly earnings growth of 7  on 12 2  revenue growth as of Oct 6  2017  According to the latest Earnings Preview  100  of the companies surpassed earnings estimates and 50  beat on revenues For 2017  total earnings for the sector are expected to increase 14 6  on the back of 8 8  revenue growth  which looks quite compelling Notable homebuilders reported stellar third

up 15 3   and backlog  up 14 5   bode well for KB Home in 2017  The company also expects the uptrend to continue to 2018 Again  Lennar Corporation  NYSE      surpassed expectations on both counts for

130371,351886,KBH,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Lennar  KB Home  D R  Horton  Toll Brothers And Century Communities,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 12  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Homebuilding  Part 3  including Lennar Corp   NYSE   NYSE LEN        KB Home  NYSE   NYSE KBH        D R  Horton  Inc   NYSE   NYSE DHI        Toll Brothers Inc   NYSE   NYSE TOL       and Century Communities  Inc   NYSE   NYSE CCS       Industry  Homebuilding  Part 3Link  Undoubtedly  the overall outlook for the U S  housing industry remains positive  with a healthy economy  strong job market and historically low mortgage rates  However  we cannot ignore that sales are decelerating in recent times  and U S  homebuilders are not feeling quite so optimistic about their sales prospects What is plaguing the industry of late is the inventory shortage that is prevailing in the U S  real estate market and the upward pressure it is creating on prices in several parts of the country  Meanwhile  Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in late August 2017  and Irma lashed Florida in early September 2017  The two devastating hurricanes have also created uncertainty for builders A healthy job market and an impressive supply demand balance will probably draw buyers  but there are other factors that can deal a fresh blow to the housing industry  Rising interest and mortgage rates  as well as land and labor shortages  raise concerns  as do tedious underwriting standards  Intensifying competition also poses a threat It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at these dampeners before investing in this space  Below we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years Labor Land ShortagePresently  the problem of skilled labor shortage is taking its worst shape in the homebuilding industry as demand continues to scale up  Meanwhile  rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins The impact of labor land shortage is twofold  On the one hand  residential construction is failing to meet demand in the absence of sufficient workers  On the other hand  to make up for rising labor costs  homebuilders are being compelled to raise home prices to maintain margins that would deter entry level home buyers Meanwhile  a recent report by the National Association of Realtors  NARs  showed that total housing inventory declined 6 5  year over year to 1 88 million  marking the 27th consecutive year over year decline  That s only 4 5 month supply  Investors should note that it is preferable to have about six months  supply for a healthy market  Land supply could remain a challenge for the housing industry in the coming quarters as well Rising land and labor costs have hurt gross margins for the likes of Lennar Corp   NYSE       KB Home  NYSE       D R  Horton  Inc   NYSE       Toll Brothers Inc   NYSE      and others  While Toll Brothers and KB Home hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   the others carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Impact of Hurricanes Harvey and IrmaAugust housing data has been weak due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma  and the sales pace is expected to remain subdued through 2017 both in Houston area and parts of Florida NAR has cut its 2017 forecast for sales in the wake of a tepid spring selling season and the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey  The group now expects 5 44 million homes to be sold in 2017  down 0 2  from 5 45 million in 2016 and well below 5 52 million expected earlier Further  economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays Volatile Mortgage RatesOn Sep 20  2017  the Federal Reserve  Fed  left interest rates unchanged  at 1 25  to 1 5   However  the Fed committee expects to raise borrowing costs once again this year  followed by three raises in 2018 Speculation of further rate hikes is niggling investors in this space  Although we see limited impact on housing demand from the upcoming rises in mortgage rates given the job market strength  its influence on the industry is undeniable and uncertain However  with the Fed announcing a hike in the benchmark Federal Funds  target rate  mortgage rates will probably rise in 2018 or thereafter  High mortgage rates dilute the demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders Additionally  the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market  Higher interest rates will only flare up the issues and further delay home purchases by millennials Rising Prices Hurting AffordabilityRising material prices  particularly lumber  along with shortages of buildable lots and skilled labor are creating upward pressure on home prices and hindering a stronger housing recovery Median sales price of existing homes rose 5 6  in August from a year earlier  The national median existing home price this year is expected to increase about 6  compared to a 5 1  increase in 2016  Additionally  the median sales price of new homes sold in August was  300 200  0 4  higher than a year ago Rising prices have kept home buyers at bay with many postponing their search for the time being  Housing affordability fell in the second quarter of 2017  according to a National Association of Home Builders or NAHB survey We would prefer to avoid Century Communities  Inc   NYSE      for the time being given its unfavorable Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Bottom LineIn    we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry going forward As you can see  there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery  But what about investing in the space right now  Will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure short term investors Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained

130395,351910,KBH,Growing Rift Between Data And Stocks  September  2017 ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in August  2017 for July  2017  At the time  I described a change in tone that made me wary and even got me anticipating a larger pullback  The iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  was struggling below its 50 day moving average  DMA  since a 2 month period starting in September  2016  Soon after that post  ITB began a rally that has now taken it to a fresh 10 year high 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  hit a fresh 10 year high partially propelled by strong earnings from KB Home KBH   The rally is starting to look stretched with three closes in a row above the upper Bollinger  Band  BB  
Source  StockCharts
So particularly thanks to strong earnings from KB Home the tone has changed 180 degrees  Yet  the housing data are not following the home builders to these lofty heights  In fact  new home sales look worse  builder sentiment and existing home sales have clearly topped out for the time being  and soaring home prices are seemingly raising more alarms  Housing starts are maintaining a robust uptrend but this trend could now portend a growing surplus of inventory  To be clear  I have not gone from bullish to bearish on the housing market  Instead  I have grown a lot more cautious on my bullishness 
Strong earnings helped to push KB Home to a new high for the year and a price unseen since KBH s post recession peak in May  2013

New Residential Construction  Housing Starts    August  2017 Single family housing starts for July were revised downward from 856 000 to 838 000  August starts increased month over month by 1 6  to 851 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts soared 17 1   well above last month s 10 9  year over year jump  The first eight months of 2017 have delivered close to and above double digit percentage gains meaning that the uptrend remains well intact 
The uptrend in housing starts keeps chugging along

After three months of wide deviations  the regional changes have been more uniform for the last three months  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each jumped 13 6   16 7   8 2   and 12 9  respectively in July  For August these percentages were  respectively  26 9    2 7   22 8   and 14 6  
Existing Home Sales   August  2017
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  For August  2017  Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana and also imposed its will on existing home sales  Sales declined on a monthly basis for the fourth month in five and marginally increased on an annual basis 
For January 2017  existing home sales hit levels not seen since February  2007  For February 2017  existing home sales dropped sharply and rebounded sharply in March to a new post recession high  Sales since have gone up and down like a yo yo  but the declines of the last two months have likely confirmed a top  The NAR took this opportunity to call out a familiar problem with existing home sales 

What s ailing the housing market and continues to weigh on overall sales is the inadequate levels of available inventory and the upward pressure it s putting on prices in several parts of the country  Sales have been unable to break out because there are simply not enough homes for sale 

Hurricane Harvey had a heavy impact on sales in the South  but the NAR expects these sales to return in 2018  During the press conference  the NAR indicated it expects 2017 annual sales to go lower than 2016 because of the hurricane  Surely September s hurricane that impacted Florida and Georgia will further dampen sales for the year 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 35M were down 1 7  month over month from 5 44M in sales for July  not revised   Sales have declined 4 of the last 5 months  Year over year sales barely increased 0 2   compare to the steady stream of year over year increases  November 15 4   December 0 7   January 3 8   February 5 4   March 5 9   April 1 6   May 2 7   June 0 7   July 2 1    Again  I think sales have topped for now especially since seasonal forces suggest that sales peak somewhere in the Spring or Summer 
Existing home sales continue to decline and are now at back to last August s level  August  2016 just barely missed being a low for 2016  February s drop was due to special circumstances  
 recall that the NAR no longer makes data available before 2013  For more historical data to 1999

First time buyers dropped to 31  from 33   This share has essentially been stuck in the low 30s all year  The average for 2016 was 35   The NAR lamented with a familiar tone 

Market conditions continue to be stressful and challenging for both prospective first time buyers and homeowners looking to trade up The ongoing rise in home prices is straining the budgets of some of these would be buyers  and what is available for sale is moving off the market quickly because supply remains minimal in the lower  and mid price ranges 

The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 27th straight month  Recall that during the June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  The 1 88M homes for sale represented a 6 5  decrease from the previous August  The string of year over year declines has been remarkable  starting from 2016 August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   May  8 4   June  7 1   and July  9 0 
In December  inventory hit 3 6 months of sales and a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  At 4 2 months of sales  relative inventory stayed even with July and was down from the 4 5 months a year ago 
Investors purchased 15  of existing homes in August  a jump from July s 13  and 12  a year ago  As I note every month  investor appetite is far from satiated 
For August  the regional performances distinctly show the impact of the hurricane as the South was the only region to fall year over year  Northeast  1 4   Midwest  0 8   South  0 9   West  0 8   All regions logged year over year price jumps  Northeast 5 6   Midwest 5 0   South 5 4   West 7 7   Note how the hurricane driven drop in sales in the South apparently did little to nothing to slow the pace of price increases there 
August s 5 6  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home incredibly represents the 66th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  253 500 fell from July s  258 800 but is still above May s previous record of  252 800  The NAR appeared startled by May s price surge and issued an alarm  That alarm seemed to grow in July as the NAR used the press conference to dismiss the notion of a housing bubble  In September s press conference  the NAR used the occasion of an upcoming statement on monetary policy from the U S  Federal Reserve to complain that the Fed does not see the price pressures from housing imposed on consumers  The Fed treats housing like an asset  similar to stocks  However  the NAR did not paint the full story because the Fed DOES include a measure of imputed rents in its inflation calculation 
For example  here is a quote from   2015    The single largest item in most household budgets is payment for shelter  Accordingly   rent of shelter  or housing has a large weight in the Consumer Price Index  CPI  and the Personal Consumption Expenditures  PCE  deflator  the two major indices of U S  consumer prices   So I would argue that the Fed s persistence in talking rate hikes despite an inflation rate that stubbornly remains below target could be partially explained by the Fed s wariness  NOT ignorance  of housing inflation  Still  it is clear that the NAR gets incrementally more worried about housing inflation with each passing month 
Single family sales decreased 2 1  on a monthly basis and increased on a yearly basis by 0 4   The median price of  255 500 was up 5 6  year over year  the past four months have delivered similar year over year gains 
 Single family home sales decreased 2 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 74 million in August from 4 84 million in July  but are still 0 4 percent above the 4 72 million pace a year ago  The median existing single family home price was  255 500 in August  up 5 6 percent from August 2016  

New Residential Sales   August  2017
Gains in new single family home sales for May cooled down the near panic over the three straight months of decline in housing construction  Unfortunately  sales took a particularly large plunge in July that threatened to break the years long uptrend  For August  hurricane impacted sales numbers have put the uptrend further in jeopardy 
The Census Bureau revised July sales of new single family homes upward from 571 000 to 580 000  New home sales for August dropped 3 4  month over month and dropped 1 2  year over year to 571 000 
New home sales look like they have peaked out for a while 
New home inventory increased from 5 8 to 6 1 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  However  inventory has not been this high since October  2011   around the trough of the housing bust  Since inventory has been slowly increasing all year  I do not think this latest jump can be discounted as a hurricane effect  I am not yet alarmed by the inventory trend  but I will be if prices start downward alongside increasing inventory  The median price of  300 200 is down significantly from July s  319 900 but is up slightly from a year ago at  298 000  These dynamics will be extremely important to watch in coming months  I find it ironic that the market responded to the new home sales report by sending the iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  to a new 10  year high on the day 
On a regional basis  new home sales returned to very divergent results  The Northeast rebounded sharply with a 65 2  year over year gain  The Midwest and the West also gained 4 5  and 4 3  respectively  The South declined 9 2   most likely a hurricane effect 
The distribution of sales across price changes took on some extremely large shifts  They were dramatic enough for me to put aside my observations from the last several Housing Market Reviews  The most dramatic shift came at the mid range with the percent of sales surging from 30  to 36   three percentage points higher than a year ago  Share in ALL other price ranges fell except at the highest range   750 000   which remained flat at 6   If this shift sustains  it could flag a deterioration in certain markets  Again  however  shifts in these price distributions have exhibited volatile behavior this year 
Note that the Census Bureau released a series of corrections to historical data on new residential sales  From the report 

Median and average sales prices in Table 1 and sales price distributions in Table 2 have been corrected for October 2014 through January 2017 to include additional response data that had been omitted from previously tabulated estimates  Monthly median and average prices were revised downward about 1 2  on average  U S  total quarterly and annual prices had somewhat larger downward revisions of up to 4 2  

In March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high at 71  The HMI remains stalled just under that 12 year high  April dropped to 68  May increased just a point to 69  June dropped to 66  July dropped further to 64  August bounced back to 67  and September dropped back to 64  The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  flagged the recent hurricanes for weighing on sentiment   The recent hurricanes have intensified our members  concerns about the availability of labor and the cost of building materials Once the rebuilding process is underway  I expect builder confidence will return to the high levels we saw this spring  
I am a bit skeptical of this claim because the rebuilding process will most likely confirm the concerns of builders  I have already heard anecdotes from Houston about the extreme scarcity of contractors and the resulting inability to get rehabilitations done 
The increased demand from rebuilding can only exacerbate already pre existing shortages  As a reminder for comparison  here are the concerns stated in the June HMI 

As the housing market strengthens and more buyers enter the market  builders continue to express their frustration over an ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots that is impeding stronger growth in the single family sector  

My earlier expectation for a new post recession high is essentially null and void at this point  All three components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  suggest that new highs are out of reach for this year  Single family detached present is back to its lowest point of the year and has taken on a slightly downward bias  Single family detached next six months just keeps bouncing between a tight range  The traffic of prospective buyers has trended downward since it hit a peak in March of this year 
The components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  have likely topped out for the year with the traffic of prospective buyers weighing the most heavily 
For May and June  there was an interesting disparity in the regional changes in HMI  In May  the West finally broke out from the flatline of the previous 4 months with a 80 reading  The West plunged in June back to 71 to a near 1 year low  For July  the West increased to 74 and for August it came within 1 month of the high from May  The South made the most improvement with an over 10  pop back to within 1 point of the year s high of 71  The disparities in September seemingly confirm that a top is in for the year  The Northeast continues to show little momentum  since April  as its HMI increased by a point  The Midwest and the South were major drags with drops of 6 and 4 points respectively  The West stands out as it increased by 2 points and sits within 1 point of the year s high set in May 
Parting thoughts Issues of housing affordability continue to attract an increasing portion of the time I dedicate to studying the housing market  This past month  two stories about the impact of unaffordable housing caught my attention  Oxford  Mississippi and Tahoe  CA 
Oxford  Mississippi The story on Oxford  MS surprised me because I think of Mississippi as having a very low cost of housing and living  It turns out both are true but wages for low income earners are low enough to make housing unaffordable even in MS 
Oxford is a college town housing the University of Mississippi  Apparently  students and working class residents alike have a hard time affording rent  Earlier this year  the town hosted a forum called  Ideas On Tap  What Happened to Affordable Housing   The city s plan to close down an affordable housing complex caused concern as many residents  transitional vouchers in hand  were struggling to find new housing  Some residents opposed a plan to build a new affordable housing complex in a wooded area that they thought should be preserved  One participant in the forum worried that Oxford would turn into a city available only to the upper class  Students in the School of Journalism and New Media at the University of Mississippi created a series dedicated to affordability issues  Last year  Mississippi Today went as far to declare a housing crisis created by a combination of high rents and low wages 
In other words  affordability issues are not the preserve of heavily populated coastal regions  The dynamics of a growing housing crunch are playing out across the spectrum 
Tahoe  CA The Tahoe area has perhaps a more predictable housing affordability problem  The area is full of expensive vacation homes that are not inhabited year round  Rentals to vacationers can squeeze out vacancy for the service workers required to keep the tourism industry humming  Many workers try to live in cheaper Reno and commute for about an hour into Tahoe  Yet  with unemployment extremely low in Reno  the long commutes quickly become unattractive to these workers 
The mismatch between housing stock and housing seekers became so acute that Tahoe and Truckee  California formed The Mountain Housing Council to address the problem  In a meeting launching the Council  the mayor of Truckee  Morgan Goodwin  revealed how he felt the issues of housing availability at a personal level 

 I have a confession to make I am a renter   Goodwin said he was recently given notice to relocate after his landlord decided to use the home to vacation in over the summer 

Here is the mission statement for The Mountain Housing Council 

Welcome to the Mountain Housing Council of Tahoe Truckee  This Council brings together a wide range of committed stakeholders to take on the unique and pressing challenges of housing in the North Tahoe Truckee region  availability  variety and affordability  The goal is to build on what was learned in the 2016 Regional Housing Study  to accelerate solutions to the region s housing problems  and to bring together government agencies  developers  land owners  nonprofit organizations  businesses  potential funders and the people of the region to implement those solutions 

The Council describes the affordability problem this way 

Of those who are living here full time  67 percent are paying more than 30 percent of their income  considered overpaying   while 26 percent are paying more than half their income for housing  Within the 474 below market rate units in the area  zero are available  with waits of 6 months to 2 years 
All those numbers add up to teachers who can t afford to live here  employers unable to staff their businesses  and would be community members that contribute to our economy  our culture and our vitality   moving away 

As if to confirm its seriousness  the Council provides  of resources for anyone concerned about housing affordability  The list includes references to a number of housing innovations and services  The site also includes two video interviews of businessmen who took matters into their own hands  One is from long time Tahoe businessman David Wilderotter of Tahoe Dave s  Wilderotter vouches for his seasonal employees with landlords by guaranteeing rent will be paid  He even helps with rental deposits and provides mortgage assistance for those with good credit who want to be more permanent residents  Wilderotter has also bought some property to provide employee housing 
A KEY quote  at the end of the video     I am buying this house as an investment in my employees  and I ll make my money on THEM  not the house  Eventually  maybe I can even turn that house over to a good employee  and then I ve got a guy forever  

Andrew Laughlin of Tahoe City Kayak and Sand Harbor Rentals deployed similar strategies after one summer having to work 7 months with only two TOTAL days off 

The videos struck me because I have long marveled at the stickiness of wages for service and lower income workers in the face of spiraling housing costs  These Tahoe area businessmen provide unique cases of businesses stepping up to make sure that housing costs do not cause labor shortages  Buying multi family dwellings strikes me as a particularly effective way of controlling housing costs for workers  These stories indicate a labor market dependent on workers who already live elsewhere and thus are mobile and likely to find other job options  These businesses are forced to compete 
As the housing data demonstrate  affordability and availability issues are not going away anytime soon  Without deeper solutions  this brewing crisis has the potential to harm the housing industry in general  Given that potential  I will continue to highlight regional stories that uncover the extent of the problem and or provide hope for solutions 
Be careful out there

In this episode  Tracey is joined by Zacks Chief Equity Strategist and Editor of the Large Cap Trader  John Blank  to discuss what is going on in the housing sector 
Several home builders have already reported third quarter earnings 
Both KB Home   NYSE KBH   and Lennar   NYSE LEN   had solid reports  with both seeing an increase in their average price home  Orders and backlogs are also on the rise for both companies 
And while home prices are hitting new highs in many big cities  mortgage rates still remain near all time lows and the job market is strong 
Should investors be jumping back into the homebuilders 
Millennial Renters
Since 2011  over 1 5 million new apartments have been built across the United States with thousands more still in the pipeline 
These buildings have mostly been  luxury  apartments with expanded amenities including spas  rock climbing walls and swimming pools  designed to appeal to young Millennials 
But some are now worried about excess supply and that a big apartment bust could be coming 
Multi Family Lending  A Danger 
In early 2017  the Federal Reserve ordered the largest banks to set out how they would fare if rental apartment values fell by more than 35  
The largest lenders of multifamily loans  at the end of 2016  were  no surprise  the largest banks like JP Morgan  JPM  and New York Community Bancorp   NYSE NYCB   
But many smaller banks like Dime Community Bancshares  and Bank of the Ozarks   NASDAQ OZRK   have also gotten into the act and have large multifamily loan portfolios 
There is a real fear of an apartment bust  But is it exaggerated 
John explains what happens at the end of a lending cycle and whether or not we re there right now in multifamily loans 
Housing Retailers Showing Strength
Maybe the way to  play  the resurgence of housing is through the retailers like Home Depot   NYSE HD   and Restoration Hardware  
Home Depot has some of the strongest comparable store sales in the entire industry  Last quarter  it saw 6 6  same store sales in the United States 
When Millennials move into a new apartment  or buy a home  they will inevitably buy furniture  rugs  lamps and accessories

130422,351937,KBH,Housing Market Update  A Notable Change In Tone ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in July  2017 for June  2017  The month from there marked a significant change in tone for home builders  The change in tone starts with the iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  and its failure to hold support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  for the first time since its last such breakdown a year ago  Indeed  part of the seasonal trade in home builders revolves around changes in the summer  Various charts on home builders have me on alert for a more significant sell off ahead 

The iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  ITB  finally broke down below support at its 50DMA  It ended the week with the barest of recoveries  Can this hold 
 Note the bottom of the chart shows ITB s performance relative to the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   from the beginning of the chart  
One key highlight of the month for me was the poor post earnings reaction to Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL   Last month  TOL almost became a lowlight  Shortly after the last Housing Market Review  TOL broke down below its 50DMA two more times  I finally had enough and sold on the second breakdown and ahead of earnings  That sale seemed validated by the poor response to earnings  Yet  TOL ended the week with a full post earnings recovery and a retest of its 50DMA  Still  I will not venture back until the seasonal trade on home builders revs back up in October or November 

Toll Brothers  TOL  is suddenly struggling to hold onto 50DMA support 
Another highlight was the spectacular post earnings performance of Invitation Homes Inc  NYSE INVH   I have touted this company and its stock since its IPO  INVH is now up about 16  from its IPO this year   Chart not shown due to disfunction in charting tools  
In the last Housing Market Review  I pointed to KB Home  NYSE KBH  as an  imminent lowlight   Not only did I lose money on the small number of call options I purchased  but KBH itself now looks more bearish than it has looked in a long time  Like ITB and TOL  KBH broke down below its 50DMA in August  Unlike the two  KBH confirmed its 50DMA breakdown as it spent half the month sliding down its lower Bollinger Band  BB   KBH is still up substantially this year  but looks like it has topped out given the full reversal from its last earnings report in late June  This month s earnings report will be a key tell  interestingly  recent data show that KBH s key markets in the West are likely doing quite well 
KB Home  KBH  is breaking down and looks like it has topped out for the year 
The change in tone in the trading of the stocks of home builders mirrors a slight change in tone in the housing market data  Housing starts increased again and match the resurgence of forward looking optimism of home builders  as seen in the sentiment indicator in the Housing Market Index   Yet  the recent decline in new home sales threatens a years long uptrend  Existing home sales have likely confirmed a top for the year even as prices continue climbing robustly and sales are up from a year ago 
   July  2017 After three months of monthly declines  housing starts finally increased in June  Housing starts declined again for July but the market s response was very muted this time and for good reason 
Single family housing starts for June were revised upward from 849 000 to 860 000  July starts decreased month over month by 0 5  to 856 000  This small change did not make a dent with the on going uptrend  On an annual basis  single family housing starts increased a healthy 10 9   similar to last month s 10 3  year over year jump  The first seven months of 2017 have delivered close to and above double digit percentage gains meaning that the uptrend remains well intact 
Single family housing starts are still printing above 2016 levels 
After three months of wide deviations  the regional changes were more uniform for June and even more so for July  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each jumped 13 6   16 7   8 2   and 12 9  respectively  The Northeast made a major recovery from June s year over year 19 2  decrease  The West cooled down from a 2 month streak of 22  year over year gains 
Again  regular readers should know the routine with the report on existing sales  sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  For July  2017  sales declined on a monthly basis but still increased on an annual basis 
For January 2017  existing home sales hit levels not seen since February  2007  For February 2017  existing home sales dropped sharply from the previous month s post recession high and served up a reminder of the month to month volatility in this series  For March  existing home sales made a sharp rebound and set a new post recession high  the highest in over 10 years   Sales since have gone up and down like a yo yo  but July s decline may have confirmed a top for now as they hit a low for the year  The NAR commentary reflected upon the frustrations of buyers who are paying more for less 

 Buyer interest in most of the country has held up strongly this summer and homes are selling fast  but the negative effect of not enough inventory to choose from and its pressure on overall affordability put the brakes on what should ve been a higher sales pace Home prices are still rising above incomes and way too fast in many markets Realtors  continue to say prospective buyers are frustrated by how quickly prices are rising for the minimal selection of homes that fit buyers  budget and wish list  

The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 44M were down 1 3  month over month from 5 51M in sales for June  revised down from 5 62M   Sales have declined 3 of the last 4 months  Year over year sales still increased 2 1   compare to the steady stream of year over year increases  November 15 4   December 0 7   January 3 8   February 5 4   March 5 9   April 1 6   May 2 7   June 0 7    Despite the year over year increase  July s existing home sales broke the uptrend in place since early 2014  another reason why I think sales have topped out for now 

Existing home sales look they have peaked out for now 
 recall that the NAR no longer makes data available before 2013  For more historical data to 1999  Source  National Association of Realtors  Existing Home Sales   EXHOSLUSM495S     September 1  2017 
First time buyers nudged to May s level of 33   up from June s 32   This share has essentially been stuck in the low 30s all year  The average for 2016 was 35   I am not surprised that the NAR lamented 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes has fallen year over year for a startling 26 straight months  Recall that during the June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  The 1 92M homes for sale represented a 9 0  decrease from the previous July  The string of year over year declines has been remarkable  August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   May  8 4   and June  7 1   This translates into markets where homes do not stay on the market for long 

 July was the fourth consecutive month that the typical listing went under contract in under one month This speaks to the significant pent up demand for buying rather than any perceived loss of interest  

The 27 days that homes stayed on the market in May was the lowest level since the NAR started tracking these data in May 2011  In July  homes  typically stayed on the market for 30 days   In June  this number was 28 days  and a year ago it was 36 days 
In December  inventory hit a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  At 4 2 months of sales  relative inventory decreased from June s 4 3 months and was down from the 4 8 months a year ago  In December  inventory was at 3 6 months of sales 
Investors purchased 13  of existing homes in July  same as in June  A year ago  investors bought 11  of existing homes for sale  As I note every month  investor appetite is far from satiated 
For July  the regional performances were exactly split between the bad and the good  Northeast  1 5   and a whopping 14  decline from June   Midwest  1 6   South  3 6   West  5 0   All regions logged year over year price jumps  whether sales were up or down  Northeast 4 1   Midwest 5 9   South 6 7   West 7 6   The price surges in the South and West make the strong annual sales increases in recent months in those regions even more impressive given the NAR has a habit of blaming high prices for lower sales in the national numbers 
July s 6 2  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home represents the 65th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  258 800 fell off a new record set in June but is still above the previous record set in May of  252 800  The NAR appeared startled by May s price surge and issued an alarm  That alarm seemed to grow in July as the NAR used the press conference to dismiss the notion of a housing bubble  August s press conference did not revisit these themes but bemoaned the on going inventory problem 
Single family sales decreased on a monthly basis  0 8   and increased on a yearly basis by 1 7   The median price of  260 600 ends four straight months of monthly gains  The median price was still up a very healthy 6 3  year over year  the past three months have delivered similar year over year gains 

 Single family home sales decreased 0 8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 84 million in July from 4 88 million in June  but are still 1 7 percent above the 4 76 million pace a year ago  The median existing single family home price was  260 600 in July  up 6 3 percent from July 2016  


Gains in new single family home sales for May cooled down the near panic over the three straight months of decline in housing construction  Unfortunately  sales took a particularly large plunge in July that threatens to break the years long uptrend 
The Census Bureau revised June sales of new single family homes upward from 610 000 to 630 000  New home sales for July dropped 9 4  month over month and 8 9  year over year to 571 000  An unusual spike in sales last July exaggerated the plunge this July as previous July s have experienced sizable declines  Still  this year s July drop may help imperil the uptrend in place since the housing market trough 
New homes sales dove deeply enough to jeopardize a years long uptrend  At best  sales are likely hitting a plateau for now 
New home inventory increased from 5 4 to 5 8 months of supply  This level continues to sit in  surprisingly  sharp contrast with the much more scarce inventory of existing homes  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply 
Unlike previous months  new home sales exhibited near uniformity across the regions  The Northeast  Midwest  and the South each saw sales decline year over year by double digits   13 5   12 7   and  11 7  respectively  The West managed to eke out a 1 4  increase  This twist in the numbers makes my previous wary and watchful eye on sales in the West particularly ironic 
After May s notable changes in the distribution of sales by sales price  I decided to watch more closely for trends in pricier homes  Homes priced from  200 000 to  299 999 bounced back while share in the pricier  300 000 to  399 999 and  400 000 to  499 999 ranges fell notably  It was good to see the sales in the median range bounce back as they represent the more typical home buyers and entry level families in many regions of the country  Homes sold in the  500 000 to  749 999 range jumped back to 8  share which is a tie for the highest level in at least a year  I concluded last month that  overall  these changes in share meant there was not yet some new trend toward pricier homes 
July s sales further cooled the notion of a trend toward pricier homes  In July the  200 000 to  299 999 emptied out from a 36  to a 31  share  Cheaper homes were a large beneficiary  While homes priced under  150 000 dropped in share from 3  to 2   the  150 000 to  199 999 range jumped from a share of 9  to 14   a share unseen since October  2016  The absolute number of homes sold increased about 50   The next two price ranges above the mid range increased share by one percentage point  The  500 000 to  749 999 range dropped from 14 to 12   The most expensive homes   750 000 and above  increased share from 2 to 3   In other words  there was a general shift away from the middle  I am tempted to think of growth in share for the lower price range as a part of a rush of entry level buyers but previous spikes toward these levels have been short lived  I will continue to monitor the changes in the price ranges in case a trend does develop from the current changes 
In March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high at 71  The HMI remains stalled just under that 12 year high  April dropped to 68  May increased just a point to 69  June dropped to 66  July dropped further to 64  and August surged ahead 4 points to 68  The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  turned on the cheer to explain the results   Our members are encouraged by rising demand in the new home market This is due to ongoing job and economic growth  attractive mortgage rates  and growing consumer confidence  
The NAHB reiterated concerns focused on the rising costs faced by builders 

  builders continue to face supply side challenges  such as lot and labor shortages and rising building material costs  

As a reminder for comparison  here are  

 As the housing market strengthens and more buyers enter the market  builders continue to express their frustration over an ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots that is impeding stronger growth in the single family sector  

Even with the pop in August  my earlier expectation for a new post recession high at some point this year is still fading  Builder expectations for the next 6 months returned to its 12 year high and led the HMI higher  So forward looking optimism will need to break out of its tight range for this year in order to get HMI to that new post recession high 

Expectations for the next 6 months is leading the Housing Market Index  HMI  higher again 
For May and June  there was an interesting disparity in the regional changes in HMI  In May  the West finally broke out from the flatline of the previous 4 months with a 80 reading  The West plunged in June back to 71 to a near 1 year low  For July  the West increased to 74 and for August it came within 1 month of of the high in May  The South made the most improvement with an over 10  pop back to within 1 point of the year s high of 71  Maybe  just maybe  there is enough momentum to get the entire HMI to that fresh post recession high  It will take optimism and regional strength to pave the way 
Parting thoughts
I began this review using the charts of ITB  TOL  and KBH as indicators of a change in tone in the stocks of home builders  Here are a few more 
MDC Holdings Inc  NYSE MDC    which I earlier held out as a freshly bullish stock but has since broken down below 50DMA support 
LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH    which broke down dramatically in the wake of Hurricane Harvey the severe storm system that battered Texas and Louisiana  LGIH soared 10  in the last two days  presumably with investors and traders recognizing the over reaction 
TRI Pointe Homes Inc  NYSE TPH    which has yet to recover from its own 50DMA breakdown 
Century Communities Inc  NYSE CCS    which I had to abandon in June just three months after touting its attractiveness as growth for a cheap price  CCS will still be at the top of my shopping list when the time comes to reload on home builder stocks 
Taylor Morn Home  NYSE TMHC    which I do not follow much but is striking given its 50 and 200DMA breakdowns 

M D C  Holdings  Inc   MDC  suffered a 50DMA breakdown in July August and rebounded from 200DMA support in the past week 

LGI Homes  Inc   LGIH  rebounded sharply about 10  to recover from a previously ominous 50DMA breakdown 

The recovery from Tri Pointe Homes ended with August s 50DMA breakdown  This week it rebounded from an even more ominous 200DMA breakdown 

Century Communities  CCS  suffered a bearish double breakdown of 50 and 200DMA support 

Not only has Taylor Morrison Home Corporation  TMHC  suffered bearish 50 and 200 breakdowns  but also the stock has declined in a near straight line for a month and a half  Almost all the year s gains have vanished 
Another housing related stock has caught my eye once again  Zillow Group  ZG   Zillow provides housing listings and data and analysis on the housing market  ZG made an impressive breakout in April May  but  as with so many other housing related stocks  August proved to be a turning point  Despite hiking revenue guidance for its third quarter and the full fiscal year  ZG tumbled and broke down  The selling was vigorous enough to complete a reversal of the gains from the breakout and force a test of 200DMA support 
Zillow Group Inc  NASDAQ ZG  completed a full reversal of its gains from Spring s big breakout 
On the positive side of August s tone  Starwood Waypoint Homes  SFR   a stock I pointed out in the last Housing Market Review  soared to new all time heights in August  SFR is riding the same momentum in home rentals as INVH 
Starwood Waypoint Homes  SFR  hit an all time high in August 
Finally  the housing crisis in California  the San Francisco Bay Area in particular  is grabbing an increasing amount of my attention  Stories abound of working people living in cars  vans  and mini RVs   what I call the  mobile homeless   Here is a particularly poignant story about a mobile homeless San Jose State professor whose husband is unemployed  She reveals how the mobile homeless cope by sneaking into neighborhoods at night and keeping possessions at a minimum 

Unfortunately  housing supply  including rentals  is so tight in the Bay Area  that raising salaries is not even a sufficient solution  More money in people s pockets just means higher demand on the same limited vacancies  In other words  more price hikes and still the same number of people left homeless 
There are several initiatives attempting to make a dent in the supply problem  especially for  affordable  housing  Recently  mayors of California s seven largest cities went to Sacramento to lobby for a series of related measures 
A  4B bond to build housing for the homeless  seniors  and veterans  No doubt the target population was strategically created to increase the chances of passing 
Streamline permitting to make it harder for cities to say  no  to new housing developments  This not in my backyard  NIMBY  syndrome is rampant in California where so many want to shut the doors behind them once they get their own piece of the pie 
New fees on real estate transactions to fund housing initiatives 

While the SF Bay Area is a highly publicized example of a growing housing crisis  there are other cities scrambling to accommodate growth  I was amazed to find talk of a real estate bubble in Nashville  Tennessee of all places  Nashville seems to have plenty of land for building  the demand is just so great that builders simply cannot move fast enough  While I have yet to understand the specific drivers of economic growth here  the soaring prices of real estate in certain areas are plenty educational 
Be careful out there

Nevertheless  July s sales pace is 2 1  higher than a year ago  Again  improving labor markets  falling unemployment rates and a limited home supply are supporting a continued rise in home prices  thereby boosting homebuilders  top line Among the top performers  since D R  Horton and PulteGroup are in close competition  let us analyze the factors to determine which company is a better investment option in this macroeconomic scenario  Since both the companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   we need to delve deeper into factors beyond rank Price PerformanceD R  Horton has gained 29 1  so far this year  while PulteGroup s shares have increased 37 7   That said  we noticed that both the companies have outperformed the industry in each of the 4 week  12 week and 52 week time frames

figures look quite promising  For fiscal 2017  12 estimates have moved higher for D R  Horton while four have gone lower in the past 60 days  The consensus trend has been pretty favorable too  with estimates increasing 1 1  from  2 75 a share to  2 78 over the last 60 days  D R  Horton expects to perform reasonably well in fiscal 2017 and 2018 on the back of its robust backlog position and well stocked inventory of land  lots and homes Earnings GrowthPulteGroup has remarkably beaten earnings estimates in five of the trailing six quarters  recording an average beat of 11 5   D R  Horton on the other hand surpassed estimates in four of the last six quarters at an average of 4 7  PulteGroup makes a better pick in terms of growth investment  Arguably  nothing is more important than

months of fiscal 2017  compared with  2 billion a year ago  The company plans to boost investments to replenish its land and lot supply in 2017 to support revenue growth  It has selectively invested in attractively priced land and lots in the past two years allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets  D R  Horton s well stocked supply of land  plots and homes provide it with a strong competitive position to meet the demand in future quarters  thereby growing sales and home closings In the second quarter of 2017  PulteGroup invested approximately  236 million in the acquisition of new land positions   For the first quarter  land investments totaled  566 million  excluding the purchase of John Wieland assets  PulteGroup s land strategy now emphasizes on investing in shorter lived smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements when possible  thereby mitigating market risk  It also focuses on investing in land where demand is more sustainable and hence they generate better returns Final ThoughtsGoing by the above factors  PulteGroup certainly has an edge over D R  Horton in terms of earnings growth expectations  price performance and valuation  Add  favorable industry trends and a VGM Score of B to this  we believe that we have a good investment proposition in PulteGroup Other Key PicksApart from PulteGroup

130481,351996,KBH,Chicago Bridge   Iron Plunges After Disastrous Q2  Here s Why,opinion,Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V    NYSE CBI   plunged 26 7  on heavy volume in the regular trading session yesterday  in the wake of its dismal second quarter2017 operating results  which included a bleak guidance and some desperate measures to counter balance sheet weakness The company plunged to eight year lows during yesterday s trading session  following the dreary Q2 results Investors are abandoning the stock in droves  in light of the miserable guidance and a dividend suspension  The stock has lost 62 3  of its value year to date  much worse than the  s decline of 6 9   This energy infrastructure services firm was forced to take desperate actions to shore up its financial position after reporting an immense drop in revenue and a huge loss  Let s discuss the company s failings  its Q2 numbers  investor reaction and prospective counteractive measures that the company hopes to employ  in detail Revenues  Revenue for the second quarter came in at 40 9   lower than the prior year quarter on declines across the board  with a particularly weak engineering and construction business  The company s total backlog also fell 7 5  year over year Earnings  The company reported a colossal GAAP loss of  3 02 per share  in stark contrast to the year ago earnings of  1 09  The effect of the dismal top line trickled down to the bottom line  which was even under more pressure as operating expenses and interest expense both escalated year over year  The company s margins were deeply affected by a rise in cost in two gas turbine projects and two LNG export facility projects  Interestingly  this is the company s third consecutive quarter of missing both top  and bottom line estimates Charges   Cost Overruns  A major reason for the bottom line loss was that the company booked substantial charges  roughly  548 million pretax  in relation to four Engineering projects  Lower than expected labor productivity  elevated costs for fabrication  and craft labor  weather related delays  subcontractor and indirect costs were responsible for the cost overruns Of the charges recorded  two gas turbine power projects  an IPL Eagle Valley project in Martinsville  Indiana  and a project for Calpine in York  Pennsylvania  contributed  181 million  This was the third round of substantial cost estimate escalation on these two power projects  Another  367 million was recorded in charges for two U S  LNG projects   a project in Hackberry  Louisiana  for Cameron LNG  and another project for Freeport LNG in Freeport  TX Cash Burn  The company reported operating cash usage of  157 million  which was driven primarily by the net loss  This reflected a startling turnaround from net cash generated from operating activities of  319 3 million in the comparable period last year  Chicago Bridge   Iron s cash burn is likely to continue as the company faces substantial risk stemming from further project degradation Guidance  Concurrent with the earnings report  Chicago Bridge   Iron released new guidance for the remainder of the year  It now expects second half earnings of  1 00  1 25 a share on revenues of  3 7  4 0 billion  Combined with revenues of  3 11 billion in the first half  the guidance implies 2017 expected sales of  6 81  7 11 billion   which is well below the previous projection of  9 5  10 5 billion for the year  Further  after racking up GAAP losses of almost  4 a share in the first half of 2017  there seems to be a slim chance that Chicago Bridge   Iron s bottom line will be in the green this year Dividend Suspension   Balance Sheet Weakness  In a shocking move  the company announced that it would discontinue paying its dividend with immediate effect  Its dividend had carried a yield of nearly 1 75  for the stock and there s no doubt that this move antagonized investors gravely  Also  the step reflects severe balance sheet weakness  as the company said that the dividend cut was apparently necessary in order to satisfy creditors and ensure compliance with certain debt covenants at end of June  The suspension of the dividend is expected to result in annual cash savings of  28  30 million Remedial Actions  The company s new CEO  Patrick Mullen  declared a flurry of measures to address its chronically poor project execution  improve efficiency and strengthen the balance sheet   To unlock hidden value  Chicago Bridge   Iron intends to sell its crown jewel Technology licensing business for roughly  2 billion or more  net proceeds are likely to exceed the company s entire net debt of about  1 5 billion   The company is also implementing a comprehensive corporate and operating cost reduction program  which it

130482,351997,KBH,Chicago Bridge   Iron Wins Storage Contract In Saudi Arabia ,opinion,Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V    NYSE CBI   won a contract from T cnicas Reunidas  S A  for new product storage tanks for Saudi Aramco s refinery in Ras Tanura  Saudi Arabia The new tanks will be part of a clean fuels expansion project  Chicago Bridge   Iron work will encompassthe engineering  procurement  fabrication and construction of nine flat bottom tanks  as well as modifications to numerous existing tanks  which were all originally supplied by Chicago Bridge   Iron   This continues a long working relationship  nearly 80 years  as the company has provided almost all of the product storage at the Ras Tanura facility  since 1938 Chicago Bridge   Iron has been treading rough waters  of late  The company plunged to eight year lows  following dreary Q2 results  Investors are abandoning the stock in droves  in light of the miserable guidance and a dividend suspension  The stock has lost 64 8  of its value year to date  much worse than the  s decline of 13 5  This energy infrastructure services firm was forced to take desperate actions to shore up its financial position after reporting an immense drop in revenue and a huge loss in second quarter 2017 Revenues for the second quarter fell 40 9  year over year on declines across the board  with a particularly weak engineering and construction business  The company s total backlog also fell 7 5  year over year With respect to earnings  the company reported a colossal GAAP loss of  3 02 per share  as a dismal top line  and escalating operating expenses and interest expense hurt profits  The company s margins were deeply affected by a rise in cost in two gas turbine projects and two LNG export facility projects The company also booked substantial charges  roughly  548 million pretax  in relation to four Engineering projects  Lower than expected labor productivity  elevated costs for fabrication  and craft labor  weather related delays  subcontractor and indirect costs were responsible for the cost overruns In a shocking move  the company announced that it will discontinue paying its dividend with immediate effect  Its dividend had carried a yield of roughly 1 75  for the stock and there s no doubt that this move antagonized investors gravely  Also  the step reflects severe balance sheet weakness  as the company said that the dividend cut was apparently necessary in order to satisfy creditors and ensure compliance with certain debt covenants at end of June  The suspension of the dividend is expected to result in annual cash savings of  28  30 million Concurrent with the earnings report  Chicago Bridge   Iron released a new guidance for the remainder of the year  It now expects second half earnings of  1 00  1 25 a share on revenues of  3 7  4 0 billion  Combined with revenues of  3 11 billion in the first half  the guidance implies 2017 expected sales of  6 81  7 11 billion   which is well below the previous projection of  9 5  10 5 billion for the year The company s new CEO  Patrick Mullen  declared a flurry of measures to address its chronically poor project execution  improve efficiency and strengthen the balance sheet  To unlock hidden value  Chicago Bridge   Iron intends to sell its crown jewel Technology licensing business for roughly  2 billion or more  net proceeds are likely to exceed the company s entire net debt of about  1 5 billion   The company is also implementing a comprehensive corporate and operating cost reduction program  which  it expects  will generate savings of  100 million on an annualized basis Not surprisingly  the analyst community has also been distinctly bearish on the stock in recent times  Chicago Bridge   Iron s earnings estimates have moved south sharply in the past 60 days  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 plunging from earnings of  3 41 to a loss of  1 68  on the back of three downward estimate revisions

130508,352023,KBH,Housing Market Review  Just Another Month ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in June  2017 for May  2017  The month from there was relatively sedate for home builders  For example  the iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  went absolutely nowhere with August s burst out the gate providing a bit of a gain 
The good news is that the uptrend defined by the 50 day moving average  DMA  remains intact  The month was one of those validations of my decisions to switch to a monthly cadence for reporting on housing data  chasing the latest data point can cause far much more volatility in analysis than is necessary 


The iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  ITB  bounced sharply to start trading in August in a move that may have confirmed support at the 50 day moving average  DMA  
The key highlight of the month for me was the strong one day reaction to housing starts and new home sales that continued to impress  Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  almost became a lowlight  I found myself at the edge of selling and locking in my profits 
Fortunately I waited one day to see whether the market confirmed a breakdown below the uptrending 50 day moving average  DMA   The following day  TOL bounced sharply along with the rest of the home builder group 

Toll Brothers  TOL  bounced its way out of a 50DMA breakdown  The stock s 50DMA uptrend now remains intact  but TOL must still break the downtrend from the recent high 
An imminent lowlight comes in the form of the call options I bought on KB Home  NYSE KBH   Despite my general ban on buying home builders in the  off season  absent a significant sell off  I decided to try to profit off continued momentum  KBH is up an incredible 47  year to date  but my call options will likely expire this month with little to no value given KBH s failure to continue its 2017 run up 

KB Home  KBH  is up an incredible 47 9  year to date
Overall  the housing data for the latest month were solid but not exciting enough to hold the attention of buyers  The end of the Spring selling season heightens the hurdle of interest   unless of course the news happens to be bad 
After three months of monthly declines  housing starts finally increased  The market reaction immediately reversed the losses on ITB from the surprisingly strong pullback in the wake of the HMI decline  see below   I was reminded that the market is always searching for a reason to dump housing stocks  especially after the seasonally strong Spring selling season 
Single family housing starts for May were revised upward from 794 000 to 799 000  June starts increased month over month by 6 3  to 849 000  This change reaffirmed the on going uptrend  and it wiped away a good deal of the previous three month s losses  On an annual basis  single family housing starts increased a healthy 10 3   This gain exceeded the previous three months of year over year gains  The previous year over year increases were 11 1  in January  13 5  in February  and 9 3  in March  8 8  in April  and 8 5  in May 

Single family housing starts jump in June and reaffirm the uptrend 
After three months of wide deviations  the regional changes were more uniform for June  The Midwest  South  and West each jumped 17 5   8 5   and 22 4  respectively  The Northeast cooled for a third month in a row this time with a whopping 19 2  decrease  The West has logged two months in a row of 22  annual gains  Looks like the market has heated up to finally deliver more housing to a very constrained marketplace  see below for similarly hot new home sales in the West  
By now  regular readers should know the routine with the report on existing sales  sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  For June  2017  sales declined 
For January 2017  existing home sales hit levels not seen since February  2007  For February 2017  existing home sales dropped sharply from the previous month s post recession high and served up a reminder of the month to month volatility in this series  For March  existing home sales made a sharp rebound and set a new post recession high  the highest in over 10 years  
For April  the yo yo dropped down slightly  in May it bounced up slightly  and in June it dropped down slightly again  On cue  the NAR switched to explaining the downtick in sales but at least this time the NAR duly noted the year over year increase 

 Closings were down in most of the country last month because interested buyers are being tripped up by supply that remains stuck at a meager level and price growth that s straining their budget The good news is that sales are still running slightly above last year s pace despite these persistent market challenges  

The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 52M were down 1 8  month over month from 5 62M in sales for May  the revision resulted in no change   Year over year sales still increased 0 7   compare to November s 15 4  year over year pop  December s 0 7  increase  January s 3 8  rise  February s 5 4  increase  March s 5 9  gain  April s 1 6  increase  and May s 2 7  increase  
February sales dropped to levels last seen September  2016 while March sales jumped to levels last seen February  2007  April  May  and June sales seem to indicate levels will stay around 10 year highs for a while although one could reasonably argue that the recent uptrend remains well in place  Such an uptrend still needs confirmation in the next few months with a new high 

Existing home sales seem content to bounce along new 10 year highs 
First time buyers dropped ever so slightly from May s 33  to June s 32  of sales  This share has essentially been stuck in the low 30s all year  The average for 2016 was 35   I am not surprised that the NAR lamented 

 It s shaping up to be another year of below average sales to first time buyers despite a healthy economy that continues to create jobs   said Yun   Worsening supply and affordability conditions in many markets have unfortunately put a temporary hold on many aspiring buyers  dreams of owning a home this year  

The absolute level of inventory of existing homes has fallen year over year for 25 straight months  Recall that during the June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  The 1 96M homes for sale represented a 7 1  decrease from the previous June 
The recent year over year declines have been remarkable  August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   and May  8 4   This translates into markets where homes do not stay on the market for long 

 Properties typically stayed on the market for 28 days in June  which is up from 27 days in May but down from 34 days a year ago  

The 27 days of inventory in May was the lowest level since the NAR started tracking these data in May 2011  In December  inventory hit a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  For June  inventory decreased  0 5   after five consecutive months of month over month increases 
At 4 3 months of sales  relative inventory increased from May s 4 2 months but was down from the 4 6 months a year ago  In December  inventory was at 3 6 months of sales  Inventory levels apparently responded slightly for the Spring selling season   a small positive sign that the NAR never acknowledged 
Investors purchased 13  of existing homes in June  down from the 16  in May  A year ago  investors bought 13  of existing homes for sale  Even with this return to the lower levels of a year ago  investor appetite is clearly not satiated 
For June  no region experienced a year over year decline in existing home sales  Northeast 1 3   Midwest 0   South 0   West 2 5   All regions logged year over year price jumps  all of them substantial  Northeast 4 1   Midwest 7 7   South 6 2   West 7 4   The price surges in the South and West make the strong annual sales increases in recent months in those regions even more impressive given the NAR has a habit of blaming high prices for lower sales in the national numbers 
June s 6 5  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home represents the 64th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  263 800 set a new record that leapt over the previous record set just in May of  252 800  This latest jump officially voids my expectation for a year over year price drop by June  2017  The NAR appeared startled by the surge in May and issued an alarm  That alarm must be growing as the NAR used the press conference to dismiss the notion of a housing bubble  Inflation adjusted prices are still 9  below the 2006 housing bubble peak  Moreover  lending standards remain extremely strict and housing starts are still running about half the pace of the bubble 
Single family sales decreased on a monthly basis  2 0   and increased on a yearly basis by 0 6   The median price of  266 200 is the fourth monthly increase after a string of monthly declines  The median price was up 6 6  year over year  slightly above May s 6 0  and April s 6 1  year over year gains 

 Single family home sales dipped 2 0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 88 million in June from 4 98 million in May  but are still 0 6 percent above the 4 85 million pace a year ago  The median existing single family home price was  266 200 in June  up 6 6 percent from June 2016  


Gains in new single family home sales for May cooled down the near panic over the three straight months of decline in housing construction  News sales performed well year over year again 
The Census Bureau revised May sales of new single family homes slightly downward from 610 000 to 605 000  New home sales for June increased 0 8  month over month and 9 1  year over year  The annual percentage gain was slightly higher than May s 8 9   This produced a convincing continuation of the on going uptrend 

Becoming routine  single family new home sales continue trending upward from the trough of the housing collapse 
New home inventory increased from 5 3 to 5 4 months of supply  This level continues to sit in  surprisingly  sharp contrast with the much more scarce inventory of existing homes  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply 
New home sales yet again exhibited a large range of year over year changes across regions  The Midwest had an impressive 3 month streak until May delivered a 23 6  year over year decline  The double digit declines continued with a 12 0  year over year drop in June  The South barely skated by in positive territory with a 0 9  year over year gain  The Northeast and the West shone brightly with whopping 41 4  and 33 3  year over year surges  Hard to believe I put the West on my  radar of caution  just two months ago 
After May s notable changes in the distribution of sales by sales price  I decided to watch more closely for trends in pricier homes  Homes priced from  200 000 to  299 000 bounced back while share in the pricier  300 000 to  399 000 and  400 000 to  499 000 ranges fell notably  It is good to see the sales in the median range bounce back as they represent the more typical home buyers and entry level families 
Homes sold in the  500 000 to  749 000 range jumped back to 8  share which is a tie for the highest level in at least a year  I have to assume the surging sales in the expensive Western region are responsible for this increase  Overall  these changes in share mean there is not yet some new trend toward pricier homes 
In March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high at 71  The HMI now appears stalled just under that 12 year high  April dropped to 68  May increased just a point to 69  June dropped to an adjusted 66  and July dropped further to 64  I heard headlines making a big deal of this drop as an 8 month low yet when the HMI was this low back in December  it was a very high reading 
Indeed  the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  called the results for July  solid  and added that  The HMI measure of current sales conditions has been at 70 or higher for eight straight months  indicating strong demand for new homes  
The NAHB s stated concerns focused on the rising costs faced by builders 

 Our members are telling us they are growing increasingly concerned over rising material prices  particularly lumber This is hurting housing affordability even as consumer interest in the new home market remains strong 
 builders will need to manage some increasing supply side costs to keep home prices competitive  

I think this piles on top of  

 As the housing market strengthens and more buyers enter the market  builders continue to express their frustration over an ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots that is impeding stronger growth in the single family sector  

Still  my earlier expectation for a new post recession high at some point this year is fading as it is now looking like it will take the anticipation of a strong Spring selling season to perk HMI back to those highs  In the meantime  the three components of HMI look like they have leveled off from recent highs 

All the components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  show sentiment has cooled off from the recent multi year high along with a slightly cooling in red hot consumer sentiment 
For May and June  there was an interesting disparity in the regional changes in HMI  In May  the West finally broke out from the flatline of the previous 4 months with a 80 reading  However  the West plunged in June back to 71 to a near 1 year low  This month  the West increased to 74 and joined the Northeast with a month over month increase  The West is off watch for sentiment given its relative out performance  Sentiment in the Midwest and the South dropped significantly by 4 and 5 points respectively 
Parting thoughts
While home builders have generally held up well  Home Depot  NYSE HD  has run into troubles that look  short term  bearish  After reporting earnings in May  HD gapped up higher but sold off from there  aka a  gap and crap   The bearish significance of this topping pattern appeared when a brief rally in June failed underneath the intraday all time high set by the post earnings reaction 
The market s wariness really showed up in the speed and eagerness of the sellers in the aftermath of an Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Panic over a deal with Sears to sell Kenmore appliances  HD s 50DMA is now turning downward and looks setup to provide stiff overhead resistance 

Home Depot  HD  printed an ominous and bearish  gap and crap  after reporting May earnings  That top  at an all time high  was confirmed when June s rally failed to hold right before the intra day all time high 
While the zoom in looks bearish  the longer term chart makes the current turmoil look like a blip on the map  HD has had an impressive run  so the current troubles are for now just a concern for short term trades  I will be paying more attention than usual to HD s earnings next week on August 15th 

Home Depot  HD  is up 231  just from 2012 s major breakout 
Note that Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  has long under performed HD  However  surprisingly enough  LOW has already overcome the Amazon Panic and what looked like at the time a major breakdown below 200DMA support  LOW is now fighting with resistance at its downtrending 50DMA 
These mega hardware stores are important  partial  barometers for household formation and first time homebuyers 
Macro housing issues have also recaptured my attention  In particular  the issue of housing affordability has become acute enough to impact the quality of life for a growing number of people  I daresay housing affordability could impede economic growth or at least put pressure on the margins of home builders  While I do not have time to discuss in detail here  I am offer up related material for the reader s review 
   A Severe Housing Crisis   July 17  2017    The New York Times 
   The story of one family fighting to hold on to their home in one of America s toughest housing markets   July 19  2017    KQED s Q d Up  This podcast article included a discussion about how corporations like Colony Starwood Homes  now Starwood Waypoint Homes   SFR  have come to dominate the market for rental homes with sometimes devastating effect  SFR s biggest markets are in Atlanta and Los Angeles  Aaron Glantz has written several revealing articles on SFR and corporate landlords 
On a related topic  Fannie Mae Research looked at the trend that has converted significant portions of the stock of starter homes into the rental market  See  Many Starter Homes Have Shifted from Owner Occupancy to Rentals   Here is a key quote 

 As single family investors swooped into the market in the wake of the housing bust and converted homes from owner  to renter occupancy  they helped to stabilize prices  remove excess vacant units from the market  and absorb a bloated inventory of foreclosed homes  While serving these important functions  they have also contributed to the starter home shortage that now appears to be slowing the return of first time buyers to the housing market

Surprise   Segmental RevenuesRevenues from the Engineering and Construction segment came in at  702 2 million  down 54 7  on a year over year basis  mainly due to the shut down of a huge cost

private equity investment firm Veritas Capital for a  700 million price  The sale is part of the company s efforts to realign the business with its long term strategy and realize cost synergies  The divestiture generated significant cash proceeds  which were used to reduce total debt to  1 8 billion at the end of the reported quarter The company has decided to sell its Technology business  which it believes would add significant value for its stakeholders  The company plans to use the proceeds to reduce its total debt and reinvest in its Engineering and Construction  and Fabrication Services businesses GuidanceChicago Bridge   Iron revised its revenue guidance for the second half of 2017  The company expects to generate revenues in the range of  3 7  4 billion  However  earnings for the second half of the year are now anticipated in the band of  1  1 25 per share Our TakeDecreased activity on large cost reimbursable LNG projects in the Asia Pacific region  the winding down of several E C projects and the timing of progress on projects in Fabrication Services group dragged revenues down in the first quarter  Persistence of these issues may pose serious threats to the company s top line growth  Further  Chicago Bridge   Iron s business is highly vulnerable to the prevalent volatility in oil prices as it can lead to reduced capital spending  which in turn may affect its projects and orders Additionally  if prices drop too low  some of the oil producing companies may go out of business  This can leave a significant negative impact on the company for the coming quarters  given its presence in the natural gas and petrochemical markets  including those for upgrading refineries  Chicago Bridge   Iron is currently facing headwinds from a decline in federal government spending

130541,352056,KBH,Fed Leaves Rate Unchanged On Inflation Concerns  5 Choices,opinion,"As was widely expected  the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged at the end of its two day policy meeting  Instead  it shifted its focus to unwinding its massive balance sheet which currently amounts to  4 5 trillion  The central bank indicated that the process of offloading the bond holdings it had built up in the years immediately after the Great Recession will begin in September 
Such a move also amounts to monetary tightening of another kind  But markets have chosen to focus on the Fed s move to recognize that inflation has remained low  belying its earlier expectations  This development has given rise to speculation that another rate hike may not occur this year after all  Given such a scenario  investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may continue to be a prudent option 
Focus Shifts to Balance Sheet Trim
With the Fed staying away from a rate hike at the end of its meeting  the spotlight is now squarely on the unwinding of the central bank s massive balance sheet  The language of the Fed s statement indicates that it will begin this process around September 
The massive  4 5 trillion balance sheet consists of Treasury securities worth around  2 46 trillion and  1 77 trillion of mortgage backed securities  Most of these securities were accumulated as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP  in the years following the recession of 2008 
Initially  the Fed plans to offload securities worth  10 billion a month which will increase within a quarter to  50 billion  Even after this cycle is completed  Fed officials project that the balance sheet will still be larger than  2 trillion  The Fed Chair and other key officials have repeatedly indicated that this process should not disrupt market activity  However  concerns that poor demand for such bonds could result in an increase in rates continue to linger 
Inflation Concerns Take Center Stage
But such concerns have been overshadowed by the Fed s change in stance on inflation  The central bank s statement dropped the word  somewhat  from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continues to remain under 2   This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative perception about one of the Fed s key objectives 
Data released earlier has already raised such concerns on several occasions  Currently  average hourly wage growth refuses to rise above 2 5   Meanwhile  the Price Consumption Expenditures index or PCE  also referred to as the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  remains at 1 4   What is noteworthy is that the labor market continues to improve  and unemployment has declined to 4 4  
This is why investors have rightly chosen to focus on the Fed s change in tone on inflation  There is a growing feeling that the Fed will not raise its rates in the near future  Following the release of the policy statement  the CME Group s FedWatch Tool declined from 52  to 50   This means that markets now believe that the likelihood of the Fed raising rates after its December meeting has declined  
Our Choices
The Fed s acknowledgement that inflation has failed to rise to its targeted levels has captured the attention of market watchers  Investors now believe that such concerns will hinder the Fed s central bank s attempts to raise rates in the near future 
This is why investing in stocks from the utilities  telecom and real estate sectors looks prudent at this time  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  
We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score 
KB Home   NYSE KBH   is a well known homebuilder in the U S  and one of the largest in California 
KB Home has a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 51 7  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 5 8  over the last 30 days  The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

continuing operations of 95 cents per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents by 18 8   The earnings figure was flat year over year However  record GAAP net income from continuing operations of 95 cents compared favorably with the year ago tally of 92 cents  The bottom line performance was primarily driven by solid non residential construction demand and strong project

Till the last quarter  EMCOR had delivered eight consecutive quarters of record year over year revenue growth Strong revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by sound performance from the

billion  up an impressive 7 6  year over year with book to bill at the highest level in almost two years  supported by a strong domestic market A rise in the backlog of the U S  Mechanical Construction  U S  Electrical Construction  and UK Building Services segments more than offset the dip in backlog for U S  Building Services and U S  Industrial Services segments  resulting in overall growth From an end market perspective  the company witnessed growth in backlog for the commercial  institutional  hospitality and healthcare markets  which was somewhat offset by the declines in industrial  water   wastewater and transportation sectors EMCOR s non GAAP operating income came in at  92 8 million  almost flat compared with the prior year quarter  Operating margins came in at 4 9

flow used in operating activities for the quarter ended Jun 30  2017  came in at  102 9 million  significantly higher than  47 8 million recorded in the previous year AcquisitionIn first quarter 2017  the company had acquired two firms   one in fire protection and one in mechanical services  Both acquisitions add unique capabilities to EMCOR s portfolio and broaden its geographic footprint In second quarter 2016  EMCOR completed the acquisition of Ardent Services  L L C  and Rabalais Constructors  LLC  collectively called Ardent   Ardent is an established provider of electrical and instrumentation services to the energy infrastructure market in North America Ardent will fortify EMCOR s market leading position in electrical construction and services  and will also serve to expand its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors  particularly in the gulf coast  western and mid continent regions  EMCOR integrated Ardent into its U S  Electrical Construction and Facilities Services segment  The company anticipates the Ardent buyout to be accretive to EMCOR s 2017 earnings by at least 10 cents per share Guidance RaisedEncouraged by its impressive top line performance  accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U S  construction space  EMCOR s management raised its 2017 guidance  with earnings from continuing operations projected in the range of  3 40  3 60  up from previous projections of  3 20  3 50   The mid point of the guided range reflects a 13  year over year increase in diluted earnings from continuing operations In light of the current size and mix of its backlog and overall positive market conditions  EMCOR raised its revenue guidance for 2017 to  7 6 billion  up from the previously expected range of  7 5  7 6 billion Our TakeEMCOR has had a decent first half of the year 2017  as the company set new records for net income and outdid revenue expectations as well  Outstanding performance in the construction segment set the tone for strong future growth  as is reflected in the company s healthy backlog and 2017 guidance Also  a healthy balance sheet position and increasing market traction added to the company s strength  indicating bright future prospects  In addition  increasing strength in the U S  construction markets bode well for the company The company sees headwinds in its U S  Industrial Services segment  which will be affected by difficult year over year comparisons created by the large specialty service project in the second and third quarters of 2016 We believe that the company s diversified business structure  along with its concerted efforts to explore beyond traditional shop related operations for tapping other profitable areas like food processing and power  will drive long term

 NYSE CBB      Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Fed Leaves Rate Unchanged on Inflation Concerns  5 ChoicesAs was widely expected  the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged at the end of its two day policy meeting  Instead  it shifted its focus to unwinding its massive balance sheet which currently amounts to  4 5 trillion  The central bank indicated that the process of offloading the bond holdings it had built up in the years immediately after the Great Recession will begin in September Such a move also amounts to monetary tightening of another kind  But markets have chosen to focus on the Fed s move to recognize that inflation has remained low  belying its earlier expectations  This development has given rise to speculation that another rate hike may not occur this year after all  Given such a scenario  investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may continue to be a prudent option Focus Shifts to Balance Sheet TrimWith the Fed staying away from a rate hike at the end of its meeting  the spotlight is now squarely on the unwinding of the central bank s massive balance sheet  The language of the Fed s statement indicates that it will begin this process around September The massive  4 5 trillion balance sheet consists of Treasury securities worth around  2 46 trillion and  1 77 trillion of mortgage backed securities  Most of these securities were accumulated as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP  in the years following the recession of 2008 Initially  the Fed plans to offload securities worth  10 billion a month which will increase within a quarter to  50 billion  Even after this cycle is completed  Fed officials project that the balance sheet will still be larger than  2 trillion  The Fed Chair and other key officials have repeatedly indicated that this process should not disrupt market activity  However  concerns that poor demand for such bonds could result in an increase in rates continue to linger Inflation Concerns Take Center StageBut such concerns have been overshadowed by the Fed s change in stance on inflation  The central bank s statement dropped the word  somewhat  from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continues to remain under 2   This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative perception about one of the Fed s key objectives Data released earlier has already raised such concerns on several occasions  Currently  average hourly wage growth refuses to rise above 2 5   Meanwhile  the Price Consumption Expenditures index or PCE  also referred to as the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  remains at 1 4   What is noteworthy is that the labor market continues to improve  and unemployment has declined to 4 4  This is why investors have rightly chosen to focus on the Fed s change in tone on inflation  There is a growing feeling that the Fed will not raise its rates in the near future  Following the release of the policy statement  the CME Group s FedWatch Tool declined from 52  to 50   This means that markets now believe that the likelihood of the Fed raising rates after its December meeting has declined  Our ChoicesThe Fed s acknowledgement that inflation has failed to rise to its targeted levels has captured the attention of market watchers  Investors now believe that such concerns will hinder the Fed s central bank s attempts to raise rates in the near future This is why investing in stocks from the utilities  telecom and real estate sectors looks prudent at this time  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score KB Home  NYSE

130581,352096,KBH,June Housing Market  Pushing Against Interest Rate Headwinds ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in May  2017 for April  2017  At that time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  was testing support at its uptrending 50 day moving average  DMA  for the third time in May 
ITB bounced nicely from there  but it just suffered its second largest one day loss of the year  Only the 2 3  one day loss on May 17  2017 surpassed the 1 9  loss on June 29th 

While iShares US Home Construction  ITB  is clearly still in an uptrend  the large one day sell off may have signaled the end of new highs for a while 
The good news is that ITB recovered quickly from May s loss  The bad news is that the end of the seasonally strong period for home builder stocks means that it will likely be much harder for ITB to overcome this latest headwind 
I am assuming a big driver of the sudden loss was a combination of a large sell off in the general market the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  lost 0 9  and at one point was down 1 4  and a sudden spike in long term interest rates  For example  the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  lost 0 8  after bouncing back slightly from a large gap down  TLT declines when rates increase and vice versa  

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  is finally below where it traded when the Fed last hiked interest rates 
I have recently accumulated call options on TLT simply because of its recent uptrend despite  and the official acknowledgement that the Fed s balance sheet will soon start shrinking  If rates actually start trending upward again  I have to assume that ITB will have an even harder time gaining ground on top of the end of the seasonal tailwind 
The housing data was overall more of the same  While housing starts spooked some housing pundits  strong new and existing home sales quickly put to rest the notion that the housing market was right on the edge of a cliff 
Watching the headlines play out reminded me that when it comes to the housing market  an on going tension exists where too many are looking for even the slightest hint that the entire market is about to collapse overnight one more legacy of the massive housing bubble and crash from the last cycle 

   May  2017  We need more home construction  

This was the plea from the National Association of Realtors  NAR  during   Unfortunately  home builders went in the opposite direction for a third month in a row 
Single family housing starts for April were revised downward from 835 000 to 826 000  Still  May starts declined month over month by 3 9  to 794 000  This change did not break the on going uptrend  but it still caused a lot of consternation by pundits given it was the third monthly decline  Yet  on an annual basis  single family housing starts increased a healthy 8 5   This is a small decline from last month s year over year gain of 8 8   The previous year over year increases were 11 1  in January  13 5  in February  and 9 3  in March 

Yes housing starts have trended slightly downward in recent months  but the overall uptrend from the trough remains well intact 
Across the regions starts varied widely for a third month in a row with the Midwest and the West contributing large surges of 29 0  and 22 2  year over year respectively  The Northeast cooled for a second month in a row with a 3 6  decrease  The South barely budged with a 0 5  decrease 

   May  2017

For January  existing home sales returned to gains and hit levels not seen since February  2007  For February  existing home sales dropped sharply from the previous month s post recession high and served up a reminder of the month to month volatility in this series  For March  existing home sales made a sharp rebound and set a new post recession high  the highest in over 10 years   For April  the yo yo bounced down slightly  and in May it bounced up slightly  On cue  the NAR switched to explaining the uptick in sales 

 The job market in most of the country is healthy and the recent downward trend in mortgage rates continues to keep buyer interest at a robust level Listings in the affordable price range are scarce  homes are coming off the market at an extremely fast pace and the prevalence of multiple offers in some markets are pushing prices higher  

The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 62M were up 1 1  month over month from a marginally downwardly revised 5 56M  from 5 57M  in sales for April  Year over year sales still increased 2 7   compare to November s 15 4  year over year pop  December s 0 7  increase  January s 3 8  rise  February s 5 4  increase  March s 5 9  gain  and April s 1 6  increase   February sales dropped to levels last seen September  2016 while March sales jumped to levels last seen February  2007  April and May sales seem to indicate levels will stay around 10 year highs for a while although one could reasonably argue that the recent uptrend remains well in place  Such an uptrend will need confirmation in the next few months with a new high 

Existing home sales have bounced around in a tight range since breaking out to a new post recession high last October 
 recall that the NAR no longer makes data available before 2013  For more historical data to 1999  
First time buyers dropped ever so slightly from April s 34  to May s 33  of sales  In March  first timers were 32  of sales  same as in February  down just one percentage point from December and January  and up two percentage points from a year ago  The average for 2016 was 35  
The NAR used this opportunity to highlight a white paper titled     The paper beings with a stark recession related statistic  the U S  added 11 8M households from 2006 to 2016 but ended up with 1M fewer homeowners  The increase in the median size of a single family home is one of many signs that home ownership has tilted toward the more well off 
From 2006 to 2015  the median square footage increased from 2 250 to 2 467   so much for the death of the McMansion  The paper s authors list the following factors impeding the expansion of home ownership  tight mortgage market  student debt burdens  lower housing supply  increasing cost of living  which presumably hinders saving for a down payment   and  post foreclosure stress disorder  which represents an increase in risk aversion to buying a home given the pain of the collapse of the housing bubble 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes has fallen year over year for 24 straight months  During the press conference  the NAR declared there is now a housing crisis  in supply  in some housing markets  The 1 96M homes for sale represented an 8 4  decrease from the previous May  The recent year over year declines have been remarkable  August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   and April  9 0   This translates into markets where homes do not stay on the market for long 

 Properties typically stayed on the market for 27 days in May  which is down from 29 days in April and 32 days a year ago  this is the shortest timeframe since NAR began tracking in May 2011  

In December  inventory hit a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  Now  inventory has managed to increase month over month for the fifth month in a row with a 2 1  increase in May  At 4 2 months of sales  relative inventory stayed flat with April and was down from 4 7 months of sales a year ago  March held inventory at 3 5 months of sales which was flat with February  In December  inventory was at 3 6 months of sales  Inventory levels apparently responded slightly for the Spring selling season   a small positive sign that the NAR failed to acknowledge 
Investors purchased 16  of existing homes in May  up from the 15  in April  A year ago  investors bought 13  of existing homes for sale  Again  investor appetite is clearly not satiated even as the month to month share of sales has demonstrated significant volatility 
On a regional basis  the Midwest was the only region to experience a year over year sales decline  Northeast 2 6   Midwest  0 8   South 4 5   West 3 4   Yet again  all regions logged year over year price jumps  all of them substantial  Northeast 4 7   Midwest 7 3   South 5 3   West 6 9   As usual  the price surges in the South and West make the strong annual sales increases in those regions even more impressive again given the NAR has a habit of blaming high prices for lower sales in the national numbers 
May s 5 8  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home represents the 63nd consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  252 800 set a new record that leapt over the previous record of  247 700 set in June  2016  This jump essentially voids my expectation for a year over year price drop by June  2017  The NAR appeared just as startled as I was by this surge  The NAR raised its biggest alarm yet about these price gains  emphasis mine  

 Home prices keep chugging along at a pace that is not sustainable in the long run Current demand levels indicate sales should be stronger  but it s clear some would be buyers are having to delay or postpone their home search because low supply is leading to worsening affordability conditions  

The question now is how long is the  long run    During its press conference  the NAR also noted that this year over year gain was double the average wage growth seen over the same period 
Single family sales increased on a monthly basis  1 0   and increased on a yearly basis by 2 7   The median price of  254 600 is the third monthly increase after a string of monthly declines  The median price was up 6 0  year over year  similar to April s 6 1  year over year jump 

 Single family home sales increased 1 0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 98 million in May from 4 93 million in April  and are now 2 7 percent above the 4 85 million pace a year ago  The median existing single family home price was  254 600 in May  up 6 0 percent from May 2016  



   May  2017

Gains in new single family home sales cooled down the near panic over the three straight months of decline in housing construction 
The Census Bureau revised April sales of new single family homes significantly upward from 569 000 to to 593 000  a second straight month of a notable upward revision  This revision greatly decreased the monthly decline of sales from March to April and produced a 2 9  gain for May new home sales of 610 000  Year over year  new home sales increased an impressive 8 9   New home construction should pick up quickly in the near future given the on going strength in demand and the on going crisis of supply for existing homes 

The uptrend for new home sales remains solid 
New home inventory decreased from 5 7 to 5 3 months of supply  This level continues to sit in  surprisingly  sharp contrast with the much more scarce inventory of existing homes  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply 
New home sales again exhibited a large range of year over year changes across regions  two positive  one negative  and one flat  The Midwest s impressive 3 month streak came to a screeching halt with a 23 6  year over year decline  The Northeast was flat year over year  The South and the West led the way with gains of 15 0  and 14 1  respectively  Last month  I put the West on my  radar of caution  after a steep 13 7  year over year decline  I am glad that number bounced back quickly as I had hoped 
The distribution of sales by sales price exhibited an interesting distortion  Homes priced from  200 000 to  299 999 were relatively robust with a growing share through April  going from 14  to 22   In May  that share dropped back to 14  with homes priced from  300 000 to  399 000 benefiting the most with an increase from 12  to 16   I will be watching the sales distribution in the coming months to see whether any new trend in pricier homes develops 

  June  2017

The Housing Market Index  HMI  was the most impressive data point of my Housing Market Review to end 2016  I thought the story for early 2017 would be a cooling of this red hot confidence  Instead  in March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high  The HMI now appears stalled just under that 12 year high  April dropped to 68  May increased just a point to 69  revised this month   and June dropped to 67  I am still expecting a new post recession high at some point this year as new home sales continue powering higher 
The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  thinks the HMI is on solid footing but indicated that home builders think the housing market could be even better if not for current economic constraints 

 As the housing market strengthens and more buyers enter the market  builders continue to express their frustration over an ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots that is impeding stronger growth in the single family sector  

In other words  builder confidence could be even stronger than current readings 
All three components declined and seem to be churning in a tight range 

As consumer sentiment has cooled off from its recent highs  home builder sentiment has stalled out across all three components  Yet  a small uptrend is still in place 
For the second month in a row  there was an interesting disparity in the regional changes in HMI  Last month  the West finally broke out from the flatline of the previous 4 months with a 80 reading  However  the West plunged this month down to 71  Confidence in the West has not been this low since August  2016  The NAHB did not offer any explanation given its focus on 3 month moving averages  While the West is off watch for new home sales  it is not on watch for sentiment  Sentiment in the Midwest increased from 65 to 69   its first increase since March  The Northeast dropped by just one point while the South dropped by 3 points 
Parting thoughts In the last Housing Market Review  I flagged Century Communities  NYSE CCS  for selling  CCS has continued to sag and seems to have confirmed a peak for now 
Century Communities  CCS  has clearly lost momentum with a relatively poor reaction to the last earnings report 
In the last Housing Market Review  I flagged M D C  Holdings  Inc   NYSE MDC  for a buy  but the stock has yet to pull back  In fact  this past week was doubly dramatic for MDC as it broke out to a new 4 year high by surpassing May s high  Sellers quickly knocked MDC off its high with a 3 8  decline  I will be watching MDC even more closely as it is one of the leaders among the home builders 
KB Home  NYSE KBH  has also emerged a strong stock  KBH is up an incredible 50 3  year to date  I of course regret ever selling my past holdings in KBH  The stock almost went parabolic going into and in response to its last earnings report  The last three days have featured very heavy trading volume  The two easy tells for KBH going forward will be post earnings lows highs and support at its uptrending 50 day moving average  DMA   Like MDC  KBH trades at a 4 year high  KBH is under two points away from a post recession high  Such an achievement would be VERY significant given KBH s perennial status as a laggard among builders 
KB Home  KBH  is having an incredible year   one that has almost finished reversing its post recession losses 
Be careful out there

130584,352099,KBH,4 Excellent PEG Stocks For GARP Investors ,opinion,In a market hurt by external shocks  equity investments need to be properly hedged  A question that arises frequently is whether one should resort to a value strategy that seeks discounted stocks or opt for growth investing in times of extreme market instability The investing track of the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha over the past few decades and his gradual shift from being a pure play value investor to a GARP  growth at a reasonable price  investor might give us all the answers In this regard  we should take note that strategic mingling of both growth and value investing principles gives us a mixed investing strategy that is getting popular with each passing day  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  And here comes the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element in it  helps finding those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio is always better for investors Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than M Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks

130585,352100,KBH,5 Stocks To Buy As Housing Starts Hit 4 Month High,opinion,"U S  housing starts turned the corner in June  rebounding from a three month long slump  Ground was broken on new homes at the sharpest annual rate recorded over four months  Surely  Wednesday s report on housing from the Department of Commerce will a long way toward restoring confidence in a sector that has had more than its fair share of troubles recently 
Fresh questions had risen about the health of the homebuilding industry after a particularly dismal report on homebuilder sentiment was released on Tuesday  But the housing starts report indicates that demand on the buyer side remains high at a time when homebuilder stocks are surging  Picking up homebuilding stocks continues to remain a lucrative option at this time 
June Rebound Ends 3 Month Decline
According to the Department of Commerce  housing starts increased by 8 3  from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 22 million in June  This represents a 2 1  annual increase  the highest recorded in four months  June s housing starts were also considerably higher than the estimated level of 1 16 million  The increase experienced last month comes after three straight monthly declines  Additionally  May s housing starts figure of 1 09 million  originally the lowest recorded in eight months  was revised upward to 1 12 million 
Building permits also increased  by 7 4   to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1 25 million  The forward looking metric also experienced a year over year increase of 5 1   implying that housing activity is likely to remain strong in the near future  Meanwhile  single family starts increased by 6 3   indicating that homebuilding companies were prioritizing homes built for sale over those intended for rentals 
Construction of multifamily homes  which includes apartment buildings and townhouses  increased by 13 3   This substantial increase represents a strong rebound after five consecutive months of declines  Additionally  housing starts experienced increases over three of the four geographical regions surveyed  This includes a 22  jump in the Midwest  Meanwhile  housing completions increased by 5 2  to the highest level witnessed since Nov 2016 
Is Falling Homebuilder Confidence Really a Worry  
The bullish housing starts report is particularly significant since it comes immediately after a substantial decline in homebuilder sentiment  In July  homebuilder sentiment declined from 67 to 64  its lowest level in eight months  The immediate trigger for the decline is the rising cost of construction materials  following the imposition of a steep tariff on Canadian lumber  Initially  homebuilders were hopeful that President Trump would deliver on promises to curtail regulations  However  the index remains well above 50  which means that improvement in the sector continues  but at a slower pace 
But the industry is less hopeful of action on the policy front  since Trump s promises continue to remain unfulfilled  Instead  homebuilders are depending on steady demand from buyers  borne out by the latest data on groundbreaking for homes  A strong labor market and a soft interest rate regime have ensured consistent gains for homebuilder stocks  For instance  LGI Homes  Inc    NASDAQ LGIH   and D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   have gained 48 3  and 34 1  year to date  The SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB   has increased by 15  over the same period 
Our Choices
A strong housing starts report has gone a long way in restoring investors  confidence in the homebuilding sector  Steady buyer demand and a soft interest rate regime are the factors which continue to power the sector

Company Comments
  chairman  president and chief executive officer offered up many comments 

 Our strong second quarter performance  particularly our 24  revenue growth  reflects our ongoing efforts to increase the scale of our business and continue the steady operational execution that are driving improvements in our profits  returns and other financial metrics  Specifically  we produced measurable expansion of our operating income margin which  combined with our backlog growing to  2 2 billion  positions us for continued meaningful improvement in our results  Looking forward  we remain committed to delivering value to our customers and stockholders and  based on the advancements we have made in the first half of the year  as well as our positive outlook  we are raising our 2017 full year financial targets  
 The housing market recovery continues on a steady path  supported by favorable industry fundamentals  Recent improvements in consumer sentiment and employment  combined with relatively low mortgage interest rates  are signaling further strength in the demand for housing  At the same time  the supply of available homes in many areas across the country remains insufficient to satisfy current needs  Given these dynamics in most of our served markets  and our present backlog level  we believe we are well positioned for continued growth with our strong product offerings  compelling customer value proposition and desirable community locations

130663,352178,KBH,Spring Looks Ready To Bloom But Will It Bear Fruit  ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in February  2017 for January  2017  At that time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  was pressing against a near 10 year high  Uptrends in the 20  50  and 200 day moving average suggested that  the coiled spring  was uncurling up and to the right  In March  ITB launched into that near 10 year high 
Strong reports from the housing market and solid earnings reports combined with an initially benign response to another rate hike from the U S  Federal Reserve to lift ITB to higher heights  While ITB swooned with the general stock market in the last week  the ETF holds a solid lead over the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   as the seasonally strong period for housing stocks continues apace 

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  surged in March  The current test of the 20 day moving average  DMA  demonstrates the strength of the current uptrend 
In the month of January  accelerating existing home sales contrasted with decelerating new home sales  For February  the two flipped around  Homebuilder sentiment once again stood in the balance  After two consecutive down months  sentiment resynchronized with housing starts and spurted higher to a new post recession high  ITB looks like it is setting up for its next up leg but larger issues may loom for home builder stocks  If confidence wanes in the ability of the Federal government to deliver on regulatory relief and tax reform  then home builder stocks could easily sell off further with the market 
Given the seasonally strong period for homebuilders is coming to an end soon  I will no longer look to buy dips aggressively  perhaps the summer    I plan to continue holding the few home builder stocks that I own  Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL   Century Communities Inc  NYSE CCS   and TRI Pointe Homes Inc  NYSE TPH    I am also holding Invitation Homes Inc  NYSE INVH  as a long term secular play on rental housing 
Single family housing starts for January were revised slightly downward from 823 000 to 819 000  February starts managed a significant monthly gain of 6 5  to 872 000  This change reaffirms the post recession uptrend  On an annual basis  single family housing starts leapt 13 5   above January s year over year increase of 11 1  
The post recession uptrend picked up steam again in February 
Across the regions  starts were up double digit percentages year over year except the Northeast which edged upward 3 8   The West returned to gains with a 10 8  jump  close to December s 13 5  gain  January delivered a 1 2  drop  The South was the big winner for a second month in a row with a 16 1  gain that just missed January s large 17 4  year over year jump  The Midwest gained 13 2  
For January  existing home sales returned to gains and hit levels not seen since February  2007  For February  existing home sales dropped sharply from the previous month s post recession high and served up a reminder of the month to month volatility in this series  Although year over year sales were still up  the National Association of Realtors  NAR  reverted to the sober tones it reserves for down months 

 Realtors  are reporting stronger foot traffic from a year ago  but low supply in the affordable price range continues to be the pest that s pushing up price growth and pressuring the budgets of prospective buyers Newly listed properties are being snatched up quickly so far this year and leaving behind minimal choices for buyers trying to reach the market  

The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 48M were down 3 7  month over month from an unrevised 5 69M in sales for December  Year over year sales increased a healthy 5 4   compare to November s 15 4  year over year pop  December s 0 7  increase  and January s 3 8  rise   Sales dropped to levels last seen September  2016 

February existing home sales fall sharply off the post recession high but the recent uptrend remains well intact 
Putting aside the NAR s swings with the monthly volatility  the main headline for existing sales is the fact they have consistently trended upward despite all the reported and now well known headwinds  The jump in sales in January demonstrated the strength in the housing market despite scarce inventory and the resulting increase in prices  The monthly decline in February did not erase that strength  especially considering year over year sales were up  Even first time buyers are hanging in there  In February  first timers were 32  of sales  down just one percentage point from December and January and up two percentage points from a year ago  The average for 2016 was 35  
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes has fallen year over year for 21 straight months  The 1 75M homes for sale represented a 6 4  decrease from the previous February  The recent year over year declines have been remarkable  August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   and January  7 1   In December  inventory hit a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  Now  inventory has managed to increase month over month for the second month in a row with a 4 2  increase 
Moreover  inventory increased from 3 5 months of sales in January to 3 8 in February  In December  inventory was at 3 6  So while inventory is extremely out of balance with demand  the small increase relative to demand suggests that constrained inventory is insufficient to explain February s increase in the median price or the drop in sales  There were likely certain price ranges that experienced notably disproportionate increases in price and drops in sales  per the NAR  I am guessing these dynamics played out in the  affordable  price ranges  
 once again seized upon a supply shortage as a jey headline for existing home sales  The most intriguing part of the story below is that investors who scooped up bargains during the housing crash are not selling rental properties back into the market as expected  Housing market watchers may recall that this  pending inventory  was part of the story housing bears told to predict on going doom and gloom for housing  Investors are enjoying the positive cash flow with price appreciation as  extra gravy  

Investors purchased 17  of existing homes in February  up from 15  in January  and December  2016  and down from 18  in February  2016  which was the highest share since April  2014   In October that share dropped from 14  to 13  which was the same share in August  In November  investor share of sales dropped to 12   The share was 11  in July  As context  recall July s share was the lowest share since 9  in July  2009  Clearly  investor appetite is far from satiated even as the month to month share of sales has demonstrated significant volatility 
The South was the only region to experience a monthly gain in existing home sales  All regions logged year over year sales gains  Northeast 1 5   Midwest 2 5   South 5 9   West 9 6   All regions logged impressive year over year price jumps  Northeast 4 1   Midwest 6 1   South 9 6   West 9 6   The price surges in the South and West make the strong annual sales increases in those regions even more impressive given the NAR has blamed high prices for lower sales in the national numbers 
February s 7 7  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home represents the 60th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  228 400 is an insignificant decline from January s  228 900  The all time record continues to fade into the distance   247 700 set in June  2016   Thus  it is increasingly possible that a year over year DECLINE in price may finally occur this year  watch how the housing bears growl over THAT headline   
Single family sales dropped on a monthly basis  3 0   and increased on a yearly basis by 5 8   November s 16 2  year over year surge was definitely an anomaly  The median price of  229 900 dropped below January s  230 400 and continues a string of monthly declines  December was at  233 500 and November was at  236 500  although price increased 7 6  year over year  Like overall existing home sales  it looks like 2017 could be the year when a year over year decline in price actually happens for single family homes 

 Single family home sales declined 3 0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 89 million in February from 5 04 million in January  and are now 5 8 percent above the 4 62 million pace a year ago  The median existing single family home price was  229 900 in February  up 7 6 percent from February 2016  


New home sales were the big headline last August as July sales soared to 622 000 and a fresh post recession high  I predicted that post recession peak would not get challenged until the next Spring selling season  That prediction looks ready to come to fruition as February new home sales hit 592 000  a 6 1  gain over February and a 12 8  year over year gain 
New single family home sales for January were revised slightly upward to 558 000 from 555 000  Recall that December brought an end to an impressive streak of year over year gains  November  17 7   October  17 8   September  24 9   August  10 7   July  24 9   and June  18 2   When January s print hit  only  5 5  I declared an end to the hot streak  Clearly  I was pre mature 

New home sales are picking up enough steam to challenge last year s post recession high 
New home inventory dropped to 5 7 from 5 4 months of supply  This level sits in  surprisingly  sharp contrast with the much more scarce inventory of existing homes  As a result  I do not think the relatively slow pace of home building can explain much of the strain on the inventory of existing home sales  Recall that the market is in balance at 6 months of supply 
New home sales again exhibited a large range of year over year changes across regions  all positive  The Northeast continued to cool down from December s torrid 48 4  gain with a 22 2  gain for January and now a 13 8  gain for February  The Midwest surged by 50 8  and accounted for almost 1 3 of the year over year increase in new home sales in the country  The South gained 7 9   and the West increased 6 8  
The Housing Market Index  HMI  was the most impressive data point of my Housing Market Review to end 2016  I thought the story for early 2017 would be a cooling of this red hot confidence  Instead  in March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high 
The Housing Market Index  HMI  registered at 71 for March  This is a 6 point surge from February and a 2 point hurdle over 2016 s historically strong close  I claimed in December that I did not expect confidence to get much higher than that 69 reading because sentiment was last that high at the top of the last housing bubble  This resurgence suggests that confidence could yet run higher and along with it even stronger fundamentals for the housing market 
The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  implied in November that the HMI might drop in the wake of the election  In December  the NAHB gave credit to the election for a surge in the HMI  The NAHB took the two month pullback  January and February  in stride by implying that sentiment had overheated  With sentiment heating up again  the NAHB took a familiar cautionary tone 

 Builders are buoyed by President Trump s actions on regulatory reform  particularly his recent executive order to rescind or revise the waters of the U S  rule that impacts permitting 
While builders are clearly confident  we expect some moderation in the index moving forward Builders continue to face a number of challenges  including rising material prices  higher mortgage rates  and shortages of lots and labor  

All three components of the HMI surged with impressive one month gains  The component for the traffic of prospective buyers made a particularly notable comeback with a new multi year high 


The regional changes in HMI were somewhat mixed  Surprisingly  the West stayed relatively flat for the third month in a row  The sequence of 75  76  and 77 make the 86 from December stand out like a huge anomaly  Against my residing assumption  the cap on sentiment on the West did NOT cap the overall HMI  Instead  the other three regions soared with the Midwest and the South  73 and 72 respectively  both surpassing December s multi year high  The Northeast soared to 53 but did not challenge December s 57 reading 
This kind of volatility in the HMI is a bit unusual  so I am definitely on watch for a major and sustained shift in HMI s trend and or dynamics 
Parting thoughts The Spring looks ready to bloom for the housing market  However  the impressive year to date results beg the question  will the stock market continue to reward strong results or will it get hesitant about post Spring results  In other words  can we look forward to any fruit  This will not be a period for aggressively loading up on housing related stocks  but sell offs will likely be buying gifts 
KB Home  NYSE KBH  reported earnings in the middle of the stock market s swoon  After an initial intraday sell off  KBH came roaring back to close the day with a respectable 1 5  gain  The  19 61 share close fell right on top of the 2 year high set on March 16th  the day after the Fed hiked interest rates again   This resilience is an important sign that home builders just might fight through the current stock market weakness 

KB Home  KBH  makes a strong post earnings comeback that ended with a tie with the 2 year high 
The chart above shows that since its collapse in early 2016  KBH has generally delivered well received earnings reports  It seems sentiment on KBH has finally turned the corner  This juncture is important because short interest remains extremely high at   The stock is cheap at just 0 5 price sales  1 0 price book  and forward P E 10 8  The 17 5 trailing P E is a bit high  The key to KBH is increased guidance which included the magic phrase  pricing power   From   emphasis mine  

 For the full year  we expect an increase in housing revenues as compared to our prior guidance  to the range of  4 billion to  4 3 billion 
Due to the strength of our first quarter  West Coast region net orders and net order value  we have increased our full year forecast for average selling price relative to prior guidance  We believe our overall average selling price for 2017 will be in the range of  385 000 to  395 000  representing a year over year increase of 6  to 9   Our expectation of a continued strong spring selling season with enhanced pricing power across many of our markets could provide an additional uplift to our ASP in the fourth quarter  

Altogether  KBH pushed itself to the top of  buy the dip  list for home builders  Note that KBH is already up 24 0  year to date 
Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  also reported earnings last week  The stock was up 22 7  year to date ahead of earnings  LEN sold off mildly and currently has support at its uptrending 20DMA  On a larger pullback  I would look to buy on a test of support at its 50DMA 

Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  pulled back slightly after reporting earnings  The strong year to date uptrend remains well intact

As for a valuation  the company appears to be Undervalued after growing its EPSmg  normalized earnings  from  0 63 in 2012 to an estimated  2 39 for 2016  This level of demonstrated earnings growth outpaces the market s implied estimate of 1 25  annual earnings loss over the next 7 10 years  As a result  the ModernGraham valuation model  based on Benjamin Graham s formula  returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the price

130697,352212,KBH,Is Real Estate 2017 s Sleeper Sector  4 Ways To Play It ,opinion,"Is Real Estate the sleeper sector of 2017  Yes  it is 

Reason  1  Millennials
Reason  2  Rising Interest Rates  yes   rising  rates  
Reason  3  Economic Expansion
Bonus Round  President Trump

The real estate cycle does not follow the stock market cycle  There are times  of course  when the stocks of real estate related firms will rise in concert with or decline as the rest of the market enters panic mode  But there have been just as many occasions in history where real estate marched to the beat of a different drummer 
In 2017  I believe the two will overlap   by which I mean we are most likely to see growth in corporate revenues and earnings  growth in workers  wages  and an increase in tax receipts  creating a fine economic revival  This would  of itself  be excellent for our selected real estate firms but in addition to the economic expansion  there are three other reasons I believe we ll see an exceptional market for the real estate firms we find most undervalued 
The first of these are the Millennials  the largest demographic bulge now that we Boomers are dying off at an alarming rate due to some disease called old age  Many Millennials have been quite happy to stay at home  often in the rooms they spent their childhood in  remodeled now to give them private access and a place for more of their stuff  Others have left that particular comfort and security behind but  like most of us when we are single  prefer to rent an apartment in urban areas where there are plenty of restaurants  bars  schools and easy and cheap public transit 
Here s the thing  Even those of us who left home at 17 to make our way and the world and didn t marry until 35  sooner or later  will frequently want to start a family  When that happens  even we want to find good schools  a house with a back yard where the kids can play and you can say yes when they beg for a puppy which they really believe they will take care of 100  of the time until they get it  When this transition happens in large numbers  people begin leaving their apartments behind and looking for single family homes 
We no longer own any of the multi family REITs we recommended a couple of years ago  They still enjoy great occupancy numbers   and their stock prices reflect it  We d rather buy the shares of companies that will benefit from the demographic trend just beginning as Millennials fall in love  marry and   gasp    move to the close in suburbs or  if financially successful  stay in town but move to a plot or townhome of their own 

The second reason we like real estate right now are rising interest rates or  more specifically  the rate of rising rates  If interest rates were to rise 50 basis points this month and 50 more next month and 50 more in two more months  that would stifle this nascent opportunity we have for growth 
But the lessening of an onerous and questionable regulatory regime and the creation of American jobs should mean that less money will go to feed a self perpetuating central government and more will be used to invest in new business and buying homes and furnishings  This is a change that takes time and involves some dislocation from government jobs back to the private sector 
It s all good in that it moves us in the good direction but it means interest rates will likely rise at a pace just fast enough to make people think  I d better take that mortgage now while rates are still low    and allows them to do so over the weeks and months it takes to actually close on their home or complete their business loan from the bank  Rising rates are not bad for economic growth  and certainly not bad for real estate  as long as they rise slowly  I think 2017 will be such a sweet spot 


Finally  we have a president who made a lot of mistakes in real estate early on  seems to have learned from those mistakes  and done quite well since  Having seen his own net worth and those of others being secured by real estate investing  I think he will be favorably disposed to encourage more Americans  by a different regulatory structure  to form businesses and buy homes 
I imagine his administration might also be open to ideas that would not have been acceptable in the past  An example  Rather than provide housing for the less fortunate by placing them in tenement housing  might he be willing to provide them with loans to buy their own homes  There are derelict houses in scores of cities that get boarded up  then razed  leaving debris strewn lots  Might these provide at least some respite from dark hallways and dangerous neighbors  Who knows what innovative strategies might be pursued if we change the thinking that the poor must be treated as wards of the state 
For all these reasons Millennials movin  on up  a better economy  a Goldilocks rising rate environment  and an administration willing to consider new ideas we think 2017 will be very good for real estate  But which area of real estate is likely to do best  There are many candidates for this honor  Here are a few of ours 
Homebuilders  There are dozens of publicly traded homebuilders serving the USA  In this case  we would favor those who build entry level homes near the biggest urban areas  Most Wall Street analysts spend their time researching the latest numbers from the bigger firms with a wealthier clientele and more expensive homes since these buyers tend to provide the builder with a higher profit margin per home and a greater likelihood of securing financing  Such companies include Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL   D R  Horton  NYSE DHI  and Meritage  NYSE MTH  
The ones that are currently overlooked but are likely to see revenue and earnings rise as more Millennials begin buying homes and starting families include Beazer Homes  NYSE BZH   PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  and KB Home  NYSE KBH   I m still narrowing this large field down  but we will be buying one or more of these this month 

Commercial lenders  These are the firms that lend money to developers of retail  industrial  medical and other office  storage  distribution and warehousing firms  This is an example where many investors incorrectly assume that rising rates are bad for such firms  If we were at 10  and rates were rising to 12  I might agree  But from this depressed level  rising rates will simply be passed along to the corporate borrowers  As long as a developer is looking at a 9 5  annualized return over the life of the loan  the difference between borrowing at 5 1 8 and 5 3 8 isn t enough to dissuade borrowing 
Most often organized as REITs  two of the leading lights in this area are Starwood Property  NYSE STWD  and Ladder Capital Corp  NYSE LADR   We own both in our personal accounts and in our Investors Edge   Model Portfolio  available to all subscribers  Commercial loans are typically big loans with lots of what ifs and how abouts written into them  In Starwood s case  it is managed by Starwood Capital and therefore affiliated with its home builder  regional mall operator  and Starwood Hotels  Starwood Capital is one of the largest asset managers in the world  which gives STWD access to information and deal flow that other firms may not have  We believe Ladder is particularly well positioned for growth here 

Medical office facilities  There are a whole lot of different ways to play the graying of the developed world  Health care is likely to be one of the most profitable  But which part of health care  Ethical drugs from Big Pharma  Cutting edge biotech  Robotic surgery  Medical devices  All very tempting  likely to have big returns   and big risks along the way  One of our preferred choices  however  is much more boring  And predictable  And  I believe  will be as much or more profitable 
You can sleep well at night and eat well the next morning with REITs that specialize in medical office facilities  As our populace ages and as we find good alternatives to our current health care system to bring more people into doctors  offices  the REITs providing triple net lease  NNN  office space well located on a hospital campus or very nearby will be in the catbird seat  There are quite a few companies in this side of the NNN business  We ve narrowed down our choices to two we believe offer the best combination of safety  geographic positioning  dividend yield and future growth  They are Healthcare Realty Trust  NYSE HR  and Physician s Realty Trust  NYSE DOC  

Lodging  As business improves  so does corporate travel  Hotels benefit  As the economy improves  people take vacations and enjoy weekend getaways  Hotels benefit  We have researched and owned a number of lodging companies  stock over the past few years  Our most recent purchase was Sunstone Hotels  NYSE SHO   first suggested for your due diligence in these pages back in September 2016  It s up 12  since then but I still consider it fairly priced  We ve also owned Hersha Hospitality  NYSE HT  and Host Hotels   Resorts  NYSE HST  and sold both of them at a nice profit  HST has been coming down the last couple of weeks so we may be snapping some more of it up as well 
There are too many individual sub sectors of the REIT and real estate market to do justice in a single article  Stay tuned and I ll do my best to delve into the others in the next few articles 
Disclaimer  I encourage you to do your own due diligence on issues I discuss to see if they might be of value in your own investing  Past performance is no guarantee of future results  It s always possible we were just lucky these past 18 years  Our news letter  The Investor s Edge   expands upon our thinking about some of the specific firms mentioned in these articles  You can find out more at inquire stanfordwealth com

130698,352213,KBH,Housing Market Review  The Promise Of Spring Awaits ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in January  2017 for December  2016  At that time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  was rebounding strongly from a brief pullback from an earnings driven 6 month high  I described the setup as a coiled spring  The coiled spring did not release to great effect  but earnings from Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  pushed ITB over the hump to a fresh 6 month high  Uptrends in the 20  50  and 200 day moving average suggest the coiled spring is at least uncurling up and to the right 
Trading volume in the iShares US Home Construction  ITB  fell off in February as it recovered from a brief pullback 
Fed fears continue to fade into the distance  Treasury yields are certainly helping investors forget about the potential for more rate hikes from the U S  Federal Reserve  Bond yields are back to their lowest point of 2017  As a result  iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  is challenging its highs for the year 
The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  looks like it is consolidating in 2017  Can TLT break out to the upside despite the prospects for higher rates from the Fed 
The latest round of housing data once again put strong uptrends on display  Interestingly  accelerating existing home sales contrasted with decelerating new home sales  Standing in the balance was homebuilder sentiment which experienced its second monthly drop in a row after hitting a new post recession peak in December  The stock market took the data in stride as earnings generally dominated the trading action in home builders  The pullback I wanted for rebuilding housing positions ahead of the Spring selling never materialized  I now look to play smaller pullbacks and or play earnings stories 
Single family housing starts for December were revised upward from 795 000 to 808 000  January starts managed a modest monthly gain of 1 9  to 823 000  This small change leaves intact the post recession uptrend  On an annual basis  single family housing starts leapt 11 1   above the previous year over year increase of 9 3  
The post recession uptrend in housing starts remained intact in January
Starts were mixed year over year across the regions  The West was the big laggard with a 1 2  drop  This decline followed a 13 5  year over year gain in December  The South was the big winner with a 17 4  year over year jump which makes up for the previous 1 7  decline  The Northeast and the Midwest were similar with gains of 9 3  and 8 8  respectively 
  existing home sales returned to gains  The National Association of Realtors  NAR  was greatly encouraged by the strong start to the year 

 Much of the country saw robust sales activity last month as strong hiring and improved consumer confidence at the end of last year appear to have sparked considerable interest in buying a home Market challenges remain  but the housing market is off to a prosperous start as homebuyers staved off inventory levels that are far from adequate and deteriorating affordability conditions  

The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 69M were up 3 3  month over month from an upwardly revised 5 51M in sales for December  previously 5 49M   Year over year sales increased an equally robust 3 8   compare to November s 15 4  year over year pop and December s 0 7  increase   Sales have not been this high since February 2007 when they were 5 79M 

Existing home sales extended the steep uptrend from early 2014 in impressive fashion 
 recall that the NAR no longer makes data available before 2013  For more historical data to 1999  Source  National Association of Realtors  Existing Home Sales   EXHOSLUSM495S     February 23  2016 
The jump in sales demonstrate once again the strength in the housing market despite scarce inventory and the resulting increase in prices  With Spring selling season about to kick off  buyers are likely to face an ever tightening market  Per the NAR   Competition is likely to heat up even more heading into the spring for house hunters looking for homes in the lower  and mid market price range   Fortunately  first time buyers continue to hang in there  They edged up to 33  of sales  up from 32  over the last two months 
The inventory of existing homes has fallen year over year for 20 straight months  In January it actually increased 2 4  over December  but the 1 69M homes for sale represented a 7 1  decrease from the previous January  The recent year over year declines have been remarkable  August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   and December  6 3   Inventory hit a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  Inventory sat at 3 6 months of sales  the same as December  The market for existing homes is severely out of balance 
In this month s report  the NAR was critical of the deal Fannie Mae   NYSE INVH  to securitize debt underwritten by Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   The implication is that INVH s rapacious appetite for buying up homes pressures the inventory of single family homes for sale  Blackstone  NYSE BX  is a majority shareholder of INVH which recently went public  INVH is one of the largest owners of single family rental homes  Given my bullishness in this space  I loaded up on INVH on the first day of trading 

Invitation Homes  INVH  is off to a great start  an 8  gain since its first close as a publicly traded company 
The share of investors remained flat at 15  of sales  In October that share dropped from 14  to 13  which was the same share in August  In November  investor share of sales dropped to 12   The share was 11  in July  As context  recall July s share was the lowest share since 9  in July  2009  In February  investors bought 18  of existing homes which was the highest share since April  2014  Investor interest has been quite volatile 
The NAR did not provide much detail on regional existing home sales except to say that  all major regions except for the Midwest saw sales gains last month  
January s 7 1  year over year increase in the median price of an existing home represents the 59th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  228 900 is a small drop from December s  232 200  With the all time record fading further into the distance   247 700 set in June  2016   it is becoming increasingly possible that a year over year DECLINE in price may finally occur this year 
Single family sales increased on a monthly basis  2 6   and increased on a yearly basis by 3 7   November s 16 2  year over year surge is looking more and more like an anomaly  The median price of  230 400 dropped below December s  233 500 and November s  236 500  and increased 3 8  year over year  Like overall existing home sales  it is starting to look like 2017 could be the year when a year over year decline in price actually happens for single family homes 

 Single family home sales grew 2 6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 04 million in January from 4 91 million in December 2016  and are now 3 7 percent above the 4 86 million pace a year ago  The median existing single family home price was  230 400 in January  up 7 3 percent from January 2016  


 were the big headline in August as July sales soared to 622 000 and a fresh post recession high  I predicted that post recession peak would not get challenged until the next Spring selling season  While new home sales in January increased 3 7  over December and 5 5  above January  2016  my assessment still looks well intact with the Spring selling season right around the corner  January s new home sales hit 555 000  12  below the post recession peak 
New single family home sales for December were revised downward slightly from 536 000 to 535 000  Recall that December brought an end to an impressive streak of year over year gains  November  17 7   October  17 8   September  24 9   August  10 7   July  24 9   and June  18 2   January s print seems to confirm that the hot streak will be over for a while  Note that I am FAR from bearish on new home sales  The extremely tight inventory conditions for existing homes supports the flow of sales for new homes 

New home sales likely hit a peak last year  Yet the choppy uptrend from the post recession trough remains intact 

The view of year over year changes shows three above zero clusters  Combined they show a very subtle pattern of lower highs   something to watch closely in 2017 
New home inventory slid slightly from 5 8 months of supply to 5 7  This level sits in  surprisingly  sharp contrast with the much more scarce inventory of existing homes 
New home sales again exhibited a large range of year over year changes across regions  The Northeast followed December s torrid 48 4  gain with a 22 2  gain for January  The Midwest only gained 4 5  while the West soared by 16 2   The Southeast was the big laggard with a 1 0  drop  the region was flat in December 
The Housing Market Index  HMI  was the most impressive data point of my Housing Market Review to end 2016  The story so far in 2017 is a  of this red hot confidence 
The Housing Market Index  HMI  registered at 65 for February  This is a 2 point drop from January and a 4 point drop from 2016 s historically strong close  As I noted in December  I do not expect confidence to get much higher than the recent high because sentiment was last that high at the top of the last housing bubble  The current pullback seems to confirm that sentiment has peaked for now 
The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  implied in November that the HMI might drop in the wake of the election  In December  the NAHB gave credit to the election for a surge in the HMI  For January  the NAHB referred back to December s observations  The NAHB has taken the two month pullback in stride by implying that sentiment had overheated   Yes  the NAHB keeps backing into explanations for the changes in the HMI    Thus  the NAHB has confirmed my assessment of a likely top in sentiment 

 While builders remain optimistic  we are seeing the numbers settling back into a normal range With much of the decline this month resulting from a decrease in buyer traffic  builders continue to struggle to minimize costs while dealing with supply side challenges such as a lack of developed lots and labor shortages Despite these constraints  the overall housing market fundamentals remain strong and we expect to see continued growth this year as some of these concerns are addressed  

All three components of the HMI dropped with the traffic of prospective buyers taking a plunge back to October s level  This component looks like it  overheated  the most  This component is back to levels it has briefly visited over the past 4 years  so it has truly normalized 

The Housing Market Index  HMI  pulled back sharply  but the current uptrends are roughly intact  Consumer sentiment remains extremely high 
The regional changes in HMI were again mixed  Surprisingly  the West stayed flat at 75  but its big plunge happened in January as December closed out at 86  As I noted before  more  normal  readings in the West by themselves should keep overall HMI capped  The Midwest and the South dropped while the Northeast experienced its own plunge from January s 51 to 41 in February 
This kind of volatility in the HMI is a bit unusual  so I am definitely on watch for a major and sustained shift in HMI s trend and or dynamics 
Parting thoughts Toll Brothers stole the spotlight from home builders in recent weeks  Investors gapped TOL to a new 14 month high in response to earnings this week  TOL initiated a   08 share dividend which should provide a bit of support for the stock  However  I strongly suspect that this dividend is a signal that TOL does not expect a burst of accelerated growth anytime in the near future 
Toll Brothers  TOL  is making very slow and halting progress in recovering from the steep sell off from over a year ago 
Century Communities  NYSE CCS  reported strong earnings two weeks ago  The market s initial response was positive but CCS reversed all its post earnings gains from there  I will take this reversal as a small buying opportunity especially since at least one analyst  FBR   Co   reiterated its outperform rating on CCS and hiked its price target from  26 to  27 
I am hearing anecdotally that the Atlanta housing market has heated up again  and it seems the move CCS made into Atlanta may prove quite timely  note that I was  about the move   I plan to review the earnings report soon  From a technical perspective  CCS has printed a relatively normal and benign pullback from a quick spurt to an all time high 
Century Communities  CCS  continues to follow its 50 day moving average  So is it  resting  before the next push to all time highs  
CCS and TOL have two of the most promising charts among the home builders I follow  An interesting dichotomy has developed between stocks that are breaking down like Meritage Homes  NYSE MTH  and LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  and stocks right on the edge of a fresh breakout like D R  Horton  NYSE DHI  and KB Home  NYSE KBH  
Pulte Homes  NYSE PHM  had an excellent January capped by its earnings report  yet the stock has failed to make any new progress since then  Surprise of the month goes to M D C  Holdings  Inc   NYSE MDC  which broke out to a new 18 month high 
I have some catching up to do on this little followed regional builder  The stock is still VERY cheap at 1 2 price book and only 0 7 price sales  The trailing P E is 14 9 and forward P E is 10 9   from Yahoo  Finance  
M D C  Holdings  Inc   MDC  is on another one of its sporadic hot streaks 
Be careful out there

However  the Texas based homebuilder s order trends remained strong in the quarter
Earnings in Line
The company reported adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  earnings increased 10  year over year driven by improved margins Revenues Miss
Total revenue  homebuilding and financial services  of  3 15 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 29 billion by 4 3   Total revenues rose 9 5  year over year 
Home Closings and Orders
Homebuilding revenues of  3 1 billion rose 9 0  year over year as the three core brands   D R  Horton  Emerald Homes and Express Homes   performed well in the quarter 
The U S  housing market remains strong  Despite a weak start this year amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals  The spring summer selling season in 2016 was better than the comparable season last year 
Home sales increased 9 1  year over year to  3 12 billion aided by higher home deliveries 
Home closings increased 9  to 10 739 homes  However  while closings rose in East  Southeast and South Central regions  it declined in Midwest Southwest and West regions 
Net sales orders rose 13  to 11 714 homes due to continued improvement in sales pace  Orders increased across all the operating regions  The value of net orders grew 14  to  3 4 billion  Cancellation rate of 21  was higher compared to 19  in the last quarter 
The quarter end sales order backlog rose 15  to 14 670 homes  Backlog value grew 17  to  4 4 billion  Sales order backlog represents homes that are under contract but not closed at the end of a certain period 
Land sales contributed  30 1 million to revenues higher than  18 5 million a year ago 
Revenues from the financial services segment increased 11 7  to  83 1 million 
Margins Improve
Gross profit on home sales was  632 2 million  up 11  year over year  Gross margin on home sales rose 40 basis points  bps  year over year to 20 3   which was slightly higher than expectations in the range of high 19 20  
Cost control  lower incentives and higher prices offset higher costs to result in the positive gross margin growth 
Homebuilding selling  general and administrative expenses  SG A  were  280 4 million  up 8 8  from the prior year quarter 
SG A expenses  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues  improved 10 bps year over year to 8 9  on better cost leverage  SG A ratio was in line with management s expected range of 8 9  to 9 1  
Homebuilding pre tax income rose 15 6  year over year to  349 2 million  Higher homebuilding revenues and lower SG A ratio drove the upside  Pre tax income from financial services came in at  29 4 million  down 7 3  year over year

130749,352264,KBH,Housing Market Review  GDP Contrasts With Relatively Healthy Housing ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in June  2016 for May  At the time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  had just reversed all its post Brexit losses along with a sharp rebound in global financial markets  I expressed concern that ITB finally reached a top for the current cycle  The ETF instead went on to register a fresh 11 month high on the heels of relatively strong housing data 
The rally came to an abrupt end with Friday s release of   The 1 2  year over year growth came in well below the 2 5   expectations   The main drag was a plunge in gross private domestic investment  Contributing to the decline was  for the first time since Q1 of 2014 
 declined month over month for the first time in at least 2 1 2 years  On a year over year basis the index still gained 6 2   Overall  the drag was a bit of a surprise given the relatively healthy housing data throughout most of 2016 
The selling in the shares of home builders in the wake of the GDP numbers has the markers of a top  high volume and following a strong fade from an intraday 11 month high  As a result I am likely to finally sell my ITB call options in the coming week even though I still have over two months to expiration 
The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  experienced a strong run up going into July s housing data  but the data itself barely moved the index until GDP 
The 2 1  1 day loss on ITB was made more dramatic by the ability of the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   to GAIN 0 2  on the day despite the surprisingly weak GDP print 
The index even traded to a marginal new intraday high before closing just under the all time high  A remaining question is whether housing  ITB  under performance will grow worse in due time or whether the general market will catch up 
New Residential Construction  Housing Starts    June  2016 Housing starts continued their stabilization since March s large drop  Privately owned housing starts for 1 unit structures came in at 778 000 for June  The May 1 unit starts were revised downward to 745 000 from 764 000  This was the second month in a row of downward revisions 
The month over month change was a gain of 4 4   The year over year growth was a robust 16 0   far exceeding May s 10 1  year over year gain  The chart below shows the uptrend remains in place 

1 unit housing starts are still in an approximate uptrend with a year over year gain of 16 
The West ended 2 straight months of losses that contrasted with the total housing start numbers  Single unit starts in the West gained 3 1  from May and gained 7 7  year over year  Still  the West did not outshine the other regions 
The South ended its streak of double digit month over month gains with a paltry 0 5   but the year over year increase was 7 2   The Northeast and the Midwest soared with 74 4  and 20 4  year over year gains respectively 
Existing Home Sales   June  2016
June delivered a fourth straight month of gains for existing home sales  The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 57M are up 1 1  month over month and 3 0  year over year  Sales have not been this high in over 9 years  since February  2007   There were two particular highlights of note  Despite the 9 year high in sales  investors were only responsible for 11   down from 13  in May  
This is the lowest share since 9  in July  2009  Recall that just in February investors bought 18  of existing homes which was the highest share since April  2014  Part of this month s decline in investor share came from an encouraging increase in first time homebuyers  First timers purchased 33  of existing homes 
This share was up from the 30  in May and the highest since 34  in July  2012  The average for 2015 was 30   In other words  BOTH the level and mix of existing sales are looking ever healthier 
The National Association of Realtors  NAR  applauded the strong results but worried as usual 

 Looking ahead  it s unclear if this current sales pace can further accelerate as record high stock prices  near record low mortgage rates and solid job gains face off against a dearth of homes available for sale and lofty home prices that keep advancing  

For the second month in a row  the West was the only region in the country to experience a year over year drop in exiting home sales  While the West increased 1 7  form May  the region dropped 0 8  year over year  The median home price soared again  this time by 7 2  year over year 
This increase exceeded all other regions despite their much better sales profiles  Per the NAR s concerns  the pace of sales in the West is likely to slow further and to help pull down overall sales 

Existing home sales hit another 9 year high 
Housing inventory decreased year over year again  This time the year over year decline was 5 8  to 2 12M  Over the last four months  inventory has had greater year over year drops  Months of inventory declined from 4 7 to 4 6 months of supply 
This level remains far short of the 6 months typically indicative of a balanced market  Forty eight percent  48   of homes sold in June were on the market for under a month  This level is down from 49  in May which was the highest percentage since tracking began in 2011  The fast pace of sales continues to help prices push upward 
June s 4 8  year over year increase in the median price of an existing home represents the 52nd consecutive month of year over year increases  June s median price across all housing types of  247 700 sets another record for existing home sales  This record was set in June  2016 and before that in June  2015 

New home sales resumed their streak to new post recession heights 
New single family home sales for June increased 3 5  above May s level and soared 25 4  year over year  The 592 000 new homes sold maintains the current uptrend that started in 2011 and resumes the setting of new post recession highs 

New home sales resumed hitting new post recession highs 
New home inventory sank from 5 3 to 4 9 months from May to June  This was a 6 0  gain from May  2015  Inventory sat at 5 8 months in February and March of 2016 which refutes my notion that April s 4 7 moths was an aberration  With sales soaring again and starts staying at stable levels  this inventory imbalance could actually worsen in coming months 
June s new home sales delivered relief for the West  In the previous 5 months  the West had suffered year over year decline in sales  For June  sales in the West soared 24 6  year over year  However  like existing home sales  these numbers were strong in the absolute but not impressive when compared to the other three regions 
The Northeast  the Midwest  and the South registered year over year gains of 30 8   44 1   and 21 1  respectively  The West edged out the South to avoid a last place finish 
Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index  July  2016
The Housing Market Index  HMI  started the year at 61 and then went four straight months at 58  In June  the HMI came to life again with a jump to 60  For July  HMI dropped slightly to 59  With an overall average of 59 for 2016  the HMI is essentially going nowhere 
The individual components remain the real story  For July  the sentiment regarding future sales   SF detached next six months   notably reversed most of its sharp gains from May to June  This reversal may signal the quick resolution of a surprising divergence from sentiment over current sales  The two sentiments are typically closely correlated 
This sharp dip for sentiment on future sales may also confirm the end of the run for ITB 

The Housing Market Index  HMI  cools off as SF Detached Next Six Months plunges from 70 to 66  Consumer index cools off in parallel 
For July  the West  surprisingly enough  was the only region to register a gain in HMI  The other three regions remained flat with June s levels  This was the West s second 1 point monthly gain in a row  I am surprised that sentiment for the West has diverged so notably from the cooling data in the region  Perhaps this divergence signals a trough for the West s performance 
Parting thoughts My  no regret  position in ITB was doing quite well until Friday s weak GDP report knocked off about half my profits  As I noted  I am taking this sharp fall from highs as a signal of a  short term   top  I remain interested in buying dips  For ITB  a buyable dip would mean a tumble at least to support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  and more likely to its 200DMA 
I also need to catch up on the recent spate of earnings in individual home builders to look for case specific opportunities  At the top of my list is Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH   In mid May  I claimed that MTH gave strong and encouraging guidance  too late  
The stock went on to gain another 18 5  before earnings brought the rally to a screeching halt  MTH tumbled 7 4  after guiding below expectations for Q3  Friday s follow up selling in sympathy with ITB has pretty much nailed a top for MTH  It seems my suspicion about MTH s guidance may have been the right call but in the wrong place 

Meritage Homes  MTH  has had a rocky record in 2016 with earnings reports 
The housing data remain relatively strong  It was a bit of a relief to see the weak streak for the West start to abate  but the West is not out of the woods even with the intriguing divergence in HMI for the West  I will look for further clues in earnings reports 
For example  I am way behind in reviewing the June report from KB Home  KBH  which could provide just the info I want on the West  Note in the chart that the market responded OK to the report until Brexit delivered a momentary hiccup 
From a technical perspective I should have bought back in on the new high following earnings  this miss is part of a bunch of post Brexit misses I made    Friday s high volume  5 5  loss has of course ended my interest in chasing the stock higher  I am back to looking for an opportune dip 

The bullish post earnings rally in KB Home  NYSE KBH  has come to an abrupt end with Friday s post GDP selling 
It is still possible that the market will reverse course after a closer look at GDP or perhaps upon future revisions  The decline in private residential investment contrasts sharply enough with the recent data on single family housing that I suspect that the real issue is multi family housing 
If so  home builder shares could  slowly but surely  reverse the GDP related losses for a nice swing trade for the nimble  Time will tell on THAT scenario 
For now  I am officially in wait and see mode on home builders  I am more interested in studying the earnings results than in trading the stocks right now  In another 3 to 4 months  the seasonal trade in home builders will start all over again  so I feel little pressure to jump back in right now 
I am very interested in understanding more about the firming but still wobbly results in the West  I have added to my list resolving the contrast between GDP and the housing data in aggregate  Hopefully  I will have made progress by the next housing market review 
Be careful out there

130751,352266,KBH,5 Stocks To Buy On Strong Housing Data,opinion,"Housing starts increased to a five month high in July  signaling that growth in the sector remains healthy  Additionally  this was the second highest pace recorded since the end of 2008 s recession  Multiple factors  such as strength in the labor market and low interest rates are continuing to fuel a housing recovery 
Additionally  homebuilders  confidence has increased this month  which indicates that this trend is likely to continue  At this point  it makes good sense to pick stocks benefiting from the substantial pickup in housing sector growth

The increase in housing starts was the second highest reading since the end of the recession  Only in February and June 2015 was an even higher increase of 1 213 million recorded  Delving into the details  single family starts inched up 0 5  to an annual rate of 770 000  However  July s strength was mostly attributable to a 8 3  increase in multifamily starts which recorded an annual pace of 433 000 
Homebuilders  Confidence Improves
Additionally  builders  morale improved this month  holding out the hope for more construction activity in the days ahead  The NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index increased 2 points to 60 in August from a downwardly revised 58 in July  This was in line with the second highest reading for the year   
Meanwhile  current sales conditions rose 2 points to 65  while the index of expected conditions increased 1 point to 67  These are gauges of builders  outlook about the present market and the forthcoming six months  respectively

130756,352271,KBH,4 Reasons To Add Pulte  PHM  Stock To Your Portfolio Now,opinion,"Despite a weak start to the year due to an array of reasons including equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals  The spring summer selling season in 2016 was better than the last year  The springtime weather boosts construction activity and traffic trends 
Additionally  positives like an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance for the second half 
Given the positive momentum surrounding the housing sector  leading homebuilder PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM   might be an interesting choice for investors at the moment 
With a market cap of  7 24 billion  the Atlanta based homebuilder enjoys a broad geographic and product diversity with a strong growth potential  Pulte currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  PULTE GROUP ONC Price and Consensus

   Why Pulte Is a Good Choice
Strong Second Quarter Results  Positive Outlook for Second Half  Building upon the strong first quarter performance  Pulte beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2016  Adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share surged 61  year over year on the back of higher home sales and lower share count  Home sales rose 41  driven by higher average selling prices  ASPs  and home closings  
We are optimistic about Pulte s second half performance assisted by the steadily improving housing market  strong backlog position  focus on higher return business and the recent Wieland acquisition 
New Value Creation Strategy  Pulte announced the next phase of its value creation strategy at the second quarter conference call 
Pulte s strategic land investments in the past few years resulted in improved volumes  revenues and profitability in 2016   a trend that is likely to continue over the next few years 
Thus  in anticipation of growth  the company plans to slow down land investments in 2017 and beyond as it has a robust pipeline to support operations for the next few years 
Pulte will use the extra cash flow resulting from the lower land spend to drive greater overhead leverage and increase share buyback activity which will result in earnings growth 
The company intends to reduce its SG A ratio from the expected 10  of home sale revenues in 2016 to a targeted rate of 9  or less in 2017  
The board of directors increased the share repurchase plan by  1 billion  raising the total authorization to  1 5 billion  The company expects to repurchase shares worth  1 5 billion over the next six quarters 
All these initiatives bode well for accelerated earnings growth over the next several quarters 
Rising Estimates and Share Price  Pulte s shares have had a good run this year  gaining around 23  year to date  Over the past 30 days  analysts have become bullish on the company  with 3 out of 5 estimates moving upward for 2016 earnings  The 2016 earnings estimate went up 1 2   while that for 2017 moved up an impressive 10 6  over the same time frame 
Restructuring and Strategic Initiatives  Apart from prudent capital allocation  Pulte is taking actions to bolster its operating and financial performance  These initiatives include enhancing overhead leverage  increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies that have led to higher profits  As part of its cost reduction program  Pulte significantly streamlined the workforce and curtailed overhead costs as well as inventory 
Moreover  aggressive debt repayment aided by improved financial position lowered the company s interest costs 
In addition  Pulte s strategic pricing programs are pushing ASPs higher for the past few quarters  These strategic initiatives allow buyers to select the lots and options that they value most  resulting in higher levels of house options and lot premiums 
Conclusion
Overall housing demand remains positive  nevertheless  Pulte has warned that the industry challenges   labor constraints and rising labor costs   are unlikely to improve in the near term 
Nonetheless  the company has been countering these headwinds successfully and is currently a good investment choice

130783,352298,KBH,June s Housing Market Review  3 Strikes Against The West ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in May  2016 for April  At the time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  was experiencing a healthy rebound on the heels of strong data on new home sales 
The rally came to a quick halt and had one more small burst in early June  I decided to dip my toe back into the water with some October call options on the iShares US Home Construction  ITB   During the stock market s brief swoon in the wake of the United Kingdom s vote to exit the European Union  EU   I did not get a deep enough dip to tease out more purchases 
I cannot shake the feeling that  is effectively over even if some latent buying interest remains  The net tepid response to the latest round of strong housing data suggests combined with what looks like growing weakness in the West across three of the main metrics I follow seem to confirm that the risk reward at these levels is tepid  I continue to wait for a larger dip to buy  per my typical strategy for trading the builders 

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  has recovered all of its post Brexit losses   time to get back to housing market catalysts 
New Residential Construction  Housing Starts    May  2016 In the last Housing Market Review I expressed relief at an apparent stabilization in housing starts  That stabilization continued in May  consistent with my expectation given strong new home sales in April 
Privately owned housing starts for 1 unit structures came in at 764 000 for May  The April 1 unit starts were revised downward to 762 000 from 778 000  So  the month over month change was a gain of 0 3   The year over year growth was a robust 10 1   The chart below shows the strong uptrend remains in place 
New housing starts stay flat from April to May and maintains the current uptrend 
The West was a big loser for the second month in a row  heightening my on going wariness about the health of the West s housing markets  Single unit starts gained 1 9  from April s big drop  but still lost 4 8  year over year  The South registered another double digit year over year gain which was also a 2 6  month over month gain  I guess a migration from the West to the South really is happening  
   May  2016
May delivered a second straight month of gains for existing home sales  Sales have not been this high in over 9 years  The National Association of Realtors  NAR  worried as usual about the rising prices resulting from too much demand chasing too little supply 

 Existing inventory remains subdued throughout much of the country and continues to lag even last year s deficient amount   adds Yun   While new home construction has thankfully crept higher so far this year  there s still a glaring need for even more  to help alleviate the supply pressures that are severely limiting choices and pushing prices out of reach for plenty of prospective first time buyers  

With the momentum continuing through the Spring selling season  single family homes performed well with a 4 5  year over year gain  The 5 53M homes sold was 1 8  above April s pace  April was adjusted downward   The West was the only region in the country to experience a year over year drop in exiting home sales  While the West increased 5 4  form April  the region dropped 1 7  year over year  The median home price still soared 7 7   Once again  I see reasons to stay wary about the West s housing markets 
Existing home sales hit a new  9 year  high 
Although housing inventory increased 1 4  from the prior month  inventory is still down 5 7  from a year ago  Over the last three months  inventory has had greater year over year drops  Months of inventory remained flat at 4 7 months of supply  This level remains far short of the 6 months typically indicative of a balanced market  Forty nine percent  49   of homes sold in May were on the market for under a month  this level is the highest percentage since tracking began in 2011  As a result  prices continue pushing upward 
May s 4 7  year over year increase in the median price of an existing home represents the 51st consecutive month of year over year increases  May s median price across all housing types of  239 700 sets a new record for existing home sales  This record was last set in June  2015 
Individual investors bought 13  of existing home sales  This share could be a trough as it stabilizes the recent decline in investor share since February  February 18   March 14   and April 13   This share is still above the 12  trough in August  2015  Recall that February s 18  share was the highest since April  2014 
First time homebuyers retreated again  Their share of purchases decreased from 32  in April to 30  in May  The average for 2015 was 30   In the last Housing Market Review I wondered whether first timer share would increase from the pressure of rising interest rates  Rates since then have instead decreased 

   May  2016 April was ALL about the new home sales  This month was all about the anticipation 
New single family home sales for May fell 6 0  below April s level but jumped 8 7  year over year  This is a cooling from April s post recession high and year over year surge  The 551 000 new homes sold maintains the current uptrend that started in 2011  This small cooling is reasonable given the out sized sales pace from April and could confirm some sales were pulled forward a month  for whatever reason  

New one family home sales cool off a bit from April s post recession high 
New home inventory jumped up to 5 3 from 4 7 months in April  This was a 6 0  gain from May  2015  Inventory sat at 5 8 months in February and March of 2016  Thus  April looks very much like a bit of an aberration 
May s new home sales delivered a third strike for the West  The West dropped 8 8  year over year and was the one region of the four to decline  In the last Housing Market Review  I suspected the West would deliver its third decline of the last five months 
Needless to say  this third strike solidifies my sobering view of the West s housing markets  The Northeast  the Midwest  and the South registered year over year gains of 30 8   16 7   and 13 3  respectively  The Midwest was the one region to register a month over month gain  12 9   in sales 
Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index  June  2016
The Housing Market Index  HMI  finally increased after four months staying flat at 58  An HMI of 60 demonstrates a positive response to the strong performance of housing in April and May  but it comes one point short of the high of the year from January  The HMI component measuring future sales expectations diverged even further from the HMI component measuring current sales 
I used the downtrend in this latter measure to guess that May s new home sales would cool down  but I find it surprising that optimism over future sales continues to widen from sentiment on current sales  The chart below shows this is a rare occurrence 
The measure for future sales is at an 8 month high  This measure hit an amazing 10  year high last October  Builders are definitely holding strong onto optimism  This sentiment bodes well for continuing to buy dips in the shares of home builders 

The components of June s Housing Market Index  HMI  all increased  The forward looking measures continue to streak ahead of the measure of sentiment on present conditions 
For June  the South led the three month moving averages for regional HMI with a 2 point gain to 61  The West managed a 1 point gain  despite what I think is a shakier outlook   The Midwest and the Northeast fell 1 and 2 points respectively 
Parting thoughts The housing data remain strong  Builder sentiment is robust  In the middle of this cheer lurks a housing market in the West that looks a bit wobbly with three strikes against it in this Housing Market Review 
With the Spring selling season in the rear view mirror  I cannot imagine what catalysts lie ahead to shore up the West enough to erase my wariness in coming months  KB Home  NYSE KBH   with a large dependence on the West  managed to report earnings that the market enjoyed  Post Brexit  KBH has managed to close at a 10 month high  Perhaps I will find some lingering sparkle for the West in KBH s report 
I am also left wondering what catalyst sits over the horizon to FINALLY push the iShares US Home Construction  ITB  to a new post recession high  still 7 5  away   From a trading standpoint  I am dealing with my hesitation by waiting for dips to buy  However  given the quick recovery from Brexit  I am also not sure what catalysts lie ahead to generate a buyable dip 
Add to this cocktail my short term bearishness on the overall stock market  and I get a recipe for limbo  This state appears strange given the overall momentum in the housing data 
My compromise so far is a small investment in call options on ITB that expire in October  This trade is known as a  no regret  position if ITB manages a rally going forward  I will have a small position to take advantage  If ITB delivers a buyable dip  I will add to my existing position to accumulate the position size I prefer 
Be careful out there

130792,352307,KBH,3 Reasons Value Stock Investors Will Love KB Home  KBH  ,opinion,Many investors like to look for value in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for value oriented investors  but today let s focus on KB Home   NYSE KBH  as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous reasons why this is the case  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for ETE s status as a solid value stock below PEG Ratio for KBHWhile earnings are definitely important  it is vital to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio as this metric looks to show investors how much they are paying for each unit of earnings growth KBH manages to impress on this front as well  as the company s PEG is just 0 43  suggesting that KB Home is trading as a relative bargain right now  This is particularly the case when you compare this PEG to the industry  as the broader segment has an average PEG of 0 84 in comparison Price to Forward Sales for KB Home One of the most underrated ratios for value investors is the price forward sales metric  This ratio shows investors how much they are paying for each dollar of revenues generated  In other words  a lower number is better here while a price to sales ratio of 1 means that you are paying one dollar for each dollar in sales With a P S ratio of 0 39  KBH investors are paying 39 cents in stock price for each dollar of revenue generated by the company  Compare this to the industry average of 0 68  and it is safe to say that KBH is undervalued compared to many of its peers on this important metric  KB HOME PE Ratio  TTM    KBH Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionThe solid value ratios outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  but we should also note that the earnings estimate revisions have been trending in a positive direction as well  Analysts who follow KBH stock have been raising their estimates for the company lately  meaning that the EPS picture is looking a bit more favorably for KB Home now Over the past 30 days  6 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 2 estimates have move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as 30 days ago KBH was expected to post earnings of  1 31 per share for the full year though today it looks to have EPS of  1 35 for the full year Bottom LineFor the reasons detailed above  investors shouldn t be surprised to read that we have KBH as a stock with a Value Score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   So if you are a value investor  definitely keep KBH on your short list as this looks to be a stock that is very well positioned for gains in the near term ,2016-07-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-value-stock-investors-will-love-kb-home-(kbh)-200143010,200143010
130795,352310,KBH,4 Stocks Surging On 4 Month High Dollar Strength,opinion,Strong U S  housing starts data pushed the dollar to a four month intraday high yesterday against a basket of key currencies  This promising data proved yet again that the U S  economy is in sound shape  It was borne out by other recent data readouts including upbeat retail sales and rebounding jobs numbers The International Monetary Fund  IMF  too confirmed that the U S  economy would remain less affected by Brexit woes  The report showed that the U S  is in a far better situation than the economies of U K   the European Union and Japan to name a few As the U S  economy strengthened  so did the dollar  which eventually calls for investing in companies whose operations have a more domestic focus  Unlike companies having international operations  products of domestic oriented companies will remain cheap  which will at the same time not hurt their incomes Dollar Strengthens on Strong Housing DataThe ICE U S  dollar index that measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies hit an intraday high of 97 17 before settling at 97 10  up 0 56  on Tuesday  Such an intraday high was not seen since March Sturdy housing data helped this widely watched gauge of the dollar s value to rally higher  U S  housing starts rose 4 8  to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 189 million in June from the previous month  according to the Commerce Department  Starts on single family homes climbed 4 4  in June from May  to 778 000  A bellwether for upcoming construction  building permits too rose 1 5  to 1 153 million in June  May s permits were downwardly revised Upbeat Retail and Jobs Reports Confirm Solid FootingAccording to the Commerce Department  sales at retail stores and restaurants advanced 0 6  in June from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted  456 98 billion  Household spending was broad based  with sales excluding autos and gasoline advancing by 0 7   These positive retail sales numbers indicate sturdy consumer spending levels this spring When it comes to jobs numbers  things are also looking bright  The U S  economy created a total of 287 000 jobs in June  significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 177 000  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  The tally was also considerably higher than May s downwardly revised jobs number of only 11 000 Other major economic reports also suggest that the economy is on a solid ground  Manufacturing activity climbed to its highest level in June in almost 16 months  while the service sector index in the U S  jumped to a seven month high IMF Trims Growth  Economy Still in Sound ShapeEven though the IMF trimmed the U S  growth forecast to 2 2  this year from the prior 2 4   it did say that the economy would be sheltered from Brexit induced volatility  IMF also confirmed that the cut was mostly due to weaker than expected first quarter GDP results  which by the way is a closed chapter especially when we consider a slew of strong economic reports in June Besides  when we compare the state of other major economies  the U S  is in a far better shape  IMF cut U K  s growth forecast for this year to 1 7  from a prior 1 9   thanks to Brexit woes  The Eurozone didn t escape unscathed either as its growth for 2017 was trimmed to 1 4  from a prior 1 6   Both the pound and the euro declined against the dollar on Tuesday In Japan  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s move to come up with additional stimulus measures raised doubts about the strength of the economy  This weakened the yen against the dollar yesterday  The Chinese economy is growing but at only half of the official estimates  according to a survey of Chinese sales managers Buy These 4 Stocks with Little Overseas ExposureAs mentioned above  the U S  economy is still in a better shape compared to other major economies  It has in the past weathered many storms  emerging from them stronger  This has eventually improved the strength of the U S  dollar versus a basket of important foreign currencies Thanks to the strength in the dollar  companies having exposure to the domestic market will be at an advantageous situation compared to those with substantial overseas operations  That is because companies with significant exposure to the overseas markets will see their revenues getting hampered as prices of American goods and services will be more expensive with a stronger dollar  Hence  it will be prudent to invest in companies with operations limited to the U S   read    We have selected four

130835,352350,KBH,Pulte  PHM  Posts Solid Q1 Earnings  Time To Buy ,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on PulteGroup Inc    NYSE PHM   on May 3  2016 
On Apr 21  Pulte posted robust first quarter 2016 results with both its earnings and sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share surged 60  year over year on the back of higher home sales  slightly higher than expected gross margins and an improved SG A ratio  Reduced share count and a lower than expected tax rate also boosted earnings  Home sales rose 28  as overall demand trends remained positive 
Management noted that traffic and demand trends were positive across the country during the quarter as well as the first few weeks of April  According to management  the spring selling season is off to a   good   start  The momentum is expected to remain positive through the rest of the year amid an improving economy  rising wages  favorable job outlook and a tight supply situation 
Pulte enjoys strong fundamentals including a large scale business and geographic product diversity  consistently improving profitability  commitment to drive higher returns while pursuing a more balanced capital allocation approach 
We believe that Pulte will do well in 2016 by benefiting from the steadily improving housing market  prudent land investments  focus on high return business and the recent Wieland acquisition  Pulte acquired the homebuilding assets of privately owned John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods   Wieland    an Atlanta based move up and luxury home builder  in January this year  The Wieland buyout has strengthened Pulte s position in the Southeastern housing market 
However  broader housing market headwinds   increasingly competitive environment and cost inflation amid moderating home price gains   and the mild slowdown in sales trends in Texas remain concerns  Pulte s Texas segment accounts for around 15  of its homebuilding revenues  Orders in this market declined 9  last year but were flat in the first quarter of 2016 Texas  economy is dependent on the oil complex and the volatility in the energy sector has been hurting the region s overall economic growth and in turn  home sales 
Despite overall housing demands remaining positive  management warned that labor supply   which was tight in the quarter   is expected to remain tight through the rest of the year 
Also  the public battle between the board and the Pulte family can create organizational uncertainty  In April  the company s largest shareholder  William J  Pulte made public a letter to the board of directors that recommended the immediate removal of the long time CEO  Richard Dugas  and a change in the company s direction 
Pulte also demanded that lead independent director  James J  Postl  resign immediately from all his positions in the company  Pulte expressed his displeasure over the company s announcement that Dugas will retire as Chairman and CEO in May next year and hence  requested the board to accelerate the aforesaid process  Bill Pulte  his grandson  and another board member  Jim Grosfeld  criticized Dugas  decision to move the company s headquarters to Atlanta as well as change its overall performance strategy 
In response  Postl issued an open letter to shareholders stressing the board s strong support for Dugas and the company s value creation strategy which  has produced significantly higher profitability and shareholder returns  
Pulte holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Other homebuilders worth considering are NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR    KB Home   NYSE KBH   and D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI    All the three have the same rank as Pulte ",2016-05-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pulte-(phm)-posts-solid-q1-earnings:-time-to-buy-200128024,200128024

130861,352376,KBH,S P 500 Support Keeps Taking A Beating  Homebuilders In Focus,opinion,"T2108 Status  32 4 T2107 Status  35 8 VIX Status  13 4General  Short term  Trading Call  NeutralActive T2108 periods  Day  200 over 20   Day  8 over 30   overperiod   Day  15 under 40   Day  55 under 50   Day  72 under 60   Day  271 under 70 
Commentary The S P 500  SPY  has tested its 200DMA support for four cycles  depending on how you want to count  in just the last six weeks  Each test has produced the predictable outcome for a bull market that remains in an uptrend  a bounce off support 

The S P 500 keeps pounding away at its 200DMA support  How much longer can this go on without  resolution  
The latest test came as the market reacted to the July jobs number  The economic data seem like more of the same to me  so I cannot connect any dots from the data to the market  What I CAN say is that the U S  dollar once again failed to break through its downtrend while the S P 500 lost fractionally  I can also observe the 50DMA starting to turn downward  Moreover  the S P 500 has failed to make a fresh all time high from any of the bounces of support  Taken together  these behaviors imply a market in a weakening phase where buying power is subtly fading  the buyers are just barely able to rouse themselves enough for automatic purchases at support 

T2108 fell to 32 4  on the day  While T2108 is close again to  oversold enough  conditions to warrant some T2108 buys  I am not triggering  I now strongly prefer a true oversold reading to do any fresh  aggressive  T2108 trades  The market s internals just look too shaky to me to warrant anything more optimistic 

T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200 day moving averages  really screams out alarm at this point  T2108 has not traded over 50  since late June  and the indicator is still trapped in a definitive downtrend since 2015 s high in April 

More and more stocks are failing the grade relative to their long term trend  the 200DMA 
I still marvel that the S P 500 can continue to perform so well even as such an important indicator demonstrates such consistent weakness  The Guggenheim Invest S P 500 Equal Weight  NYSE RSP  is still showing hints of this weakness  RSP has trended down since May  So  the average stock is losing altitude even as the S P 500 remains aloft 

The Guggenheim S P 500 Equal Weight ETF  RSP  is holding last month s low but is definitively trending downward from its May  2015 peak 
So  it is natural to wonder just how long can the S P 500 s support continue to hold 
The CBOE Volatility Index is still so low that buying insurance is a very attractive proposition  The VIX even DECLINED on Friday on a strong fade from its high at 14 58 
Homebuilders are one area of the market I still like a lot  I wrote about the extremely bullish earnings report from LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH   Regional builder Century Communities Inc  CCS  also soared on a strong report  I will write about it soon   These stocks are leaders as overall homebuilders are just hanging in there 

iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  is churning away just below its 8 year high
Of the major builders that have my interest  I am watching KB Home  NYSE KBH  particularly closely right now from a technical standpoint  KBH produced a strong earnings report in mid June  After a few days of additional gains  the stock has been mainly downhill ever since  Last week  the stock officially and completely reversed its post earnings gains  With closes below the 200DMA to boot  KBH is now in a dangerzone  In the chart below  note how this reversal means that KBH s downtrend from its 2013 peak remains in play 

The path for KB Home  KBH  has been incredibly choppy for over a year as it still fails to garner sustained buying momentum 
Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH  also has me worried  It closed Friday with a meek bounce off 200DMA support  Since a rip roaring start to 2015  MTH has stalled out  The stock now trades directly below where it was when MTH proudly announced a very strong start to the year 

Meritage Homes  MTH  descends to a critical point of support as 2015 momentum continues to wane
Back to the POSITIVE side  DR Horton Inc   NYSE DHI  hit a fresh 8 1 2 year high at the end of July after a 4 day post earnings sprint  The current pullback is generating a juicy buying opportunity for anyone not yet in the stock and even for swing traders  Note how DHI perfectly bounced off the 20DMA uptrend on Friday  Earnings seemed to validate the 200DMA as sustained support 

DR Horton Inc   DHI  helps lead the way for homebuilders with a recent 8 1 2 year high
I conclude with a recent hot IPO Fitbit Inc  NYSE FIT   To me  FIT is the classic example of a fad stock that can ride the waves of euphoria much longer than one might expect  FIT upsized its IPO to 36 575 million shares and a  20 share debut  FIT opened at  30 40  got as high as  31 90  and closed at  29 68  I thought at best FIT would proceed to chop around with a weakening bias  Instead  FIT managed to run up about 72  going into its first earnings report as a publicly traded company  The market proceeded to knock the stock down despite strong headline numbers and increased guidance  The stock seems to be trading ahead of reality on the ground 

I am now watching like a hawk to see whether buyers return to give FIT a fresh breath of life and upward momentum  say  a close at a fresh post earnings high  Otherwise  I can easily see FIT trading back toward its debut levels in coming months  Expectations are high with a 44 forward P E  92 trailing P E   9x sales  and 34x book value  The last two days of post earnings selling represent a 17  loss from FIT s all time high 

The market overshoots ahead of earnings on one of the year s hot IPOs  Fitbit  FIT

130862,352377,KBH,The Canary In Coal Stocks And Fossil Fuel,opinion,"We just came across this   a contributor to the New York Times and The Economist  among other news outlets  He espouses the traditional contrarian take on the down and outers  which are  in this case  fossil fuel companies  Mr  Brush s thesis is that  the most hated companies will eventually bounce back strongly   He cites five reasons 
At around  44 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate  WTI   oil will probably hold its ground near the lows it hit twice earlier this year before bouncing higher 
Investors are too worried about Iran 
Saudi Arabia will get what it wants  less supply from others  But not the way many investors think  and it will still take a while  But it will happen 
Meanwhile  lower oil prices prices are boosting demand  A lot 
Energy insiders just turned very bullish 
All eminently reasonable  with a dash of geopolitics thrown in for good measure  But Mr  Brush  who may reflect the state of conventional thought within the investment community  ignores the largest macro influence on fossil energy companies today  We emailed Mr  Brush to ask   In your column on energy stocks you re currently recommending  you made no mention of the effect of climate change on the supply demand equation for fossil fuels  Why   We have not yet received a response  but would be happy to publish his comment should we receive it 
Here s one climate aware answer to Mr  Brush s Saudi point from the Financial Post a few months ago   Naimi and other Saudi leaders have worried for years that climate change and high crude prices will boost energy efficiency  encourage renewables  and accelerate a switch to alternative fuels such as natural gas  especially in the emerging markets that they count on for growth   And this leads to a question  How is it that the Saudis  with their vast reservoirs of oil  are worried about the effects of climate change on oil markets  and Mr  Brush isn t  If the Saudis are rational actors  their assumption of shrinking oil markets due to climate change would lead them to sell every last barrel they could before the energy market takes a sharp turn towards renewables  This is what holders of oil reserves will do if they are concerned about stranded assets  Do you really think they are ignorant of what s happening in coal 
It may well be that Mr  Brush and  earlier this year  Mr  Skorina  opining on the fossil fuel divestment issue  are surveying the known universe when they reach their conclusions  If  as a small random sample of Wall Street thought  they left climate change out of their portfolio considerations  perhaps it s because conventional analysis defines the playing field as supply demand influences within the oil markets and related macro economic factors but not the climate change tidal wave  figurative and literal  whose approach turns conventional assumptions upside down 
If Mr  Brush and Mr  Skorina are examples of conventional Wall Street group think  it explains how hedge fund managers and professional investors  supposedly the best and brightest  can be so easily fooled by tribal considerations  and sometime affinity fraud  as they ignore matters most linked to the health of their portfolios

Science  folks  is science  Investors generally don t have a problem with scientific conclusions  to the contrary  they generally want to be the first onto the new research  since that s where the money will be  Note the phrase  will be   not  was   That s key to understanding the current attempts to obscure climate science  There is now information in the public domain highlighting the efforts of at least two mega investors to put a finger on the scale of climate science 
Several years ago  the Koch Brothers tried to rent a scientist and hired Richard Muller  a physics professor at UC Berkeley who was a prominent climate science skeptic  As you can see  it appears they did not get what they paid for  we don t know if they asked for their money back  But Dr  Muller  upon a careful review of the evidence  concluded that  the average temperature of the earth s land has  an increase of 1 1 2 degrees F  over the most recent 50 years  and that  essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases   It should also be noted that the Koch Brothers are known to be active against solar energy as well at the government level  One might conclude that they believe in free markets for themselves more than for their competitors  and support government interventions for their own interests  but not for others  If their actions suggest they don t really believe in free markets   well  that s a different discussion 
Paul Singer of Elliott Associates  who reportedly provided a significant percentage of funding for a Danish climate denier has been more fortunate thus far  as his protege has had articles published in the Wall Street Journal  among other places 
Suppose 100 years ago buggy whip and horse drawn cart makers had started a disinformation campaign against the automobile in its early stages  maintaining that  a  the science wasn t proven  b  the rise of automobiles would cost people in the affected industries their jobs  Creative destruction is an accepted notion of capitalism  We wonder why the same free market business owners who will happily shrink their workforce the moment they can find other efficiencies will remember to support job creation just when their own profit streams are most at risk from market forces  Change creates jobs  just not in your company if you re making today s buggy whips 
Do you want to be persuaded to take a position contrary to accepted science just because a few guys with a lot of money and power want to protect their positions  For a billionaire  the incremental cost of sowing doubt is minute compared to the economic benefits  When the cost of trying to buy and disseminate faux scientific conclusions is the equivalent of leaving a tip for a waiter in a fine restaurant  the burden of due diligence for the other investors becomes considerably greater 
Coal as Harbinger of Broader Fossil Fuel Price Deterioration
The value of coal stocks have generally fallen about 80  in the last four years  And this has occurred in spite of the coal industry s ability to socialize private costs by offloading substantial ancillary health and clean up costs onto the taxpayer  Apart from that  the beloved free market is speaking  as noted in this recent Bloomberg article 
 King Coal is dying of natural causes  Market forces  technological advances  and public demands for clean air and climate action have combined to make alternative sources of energy more financially attractive  The price of new wind power  for example  is lower than that of coal in most parts of the country  
Perhaps Mr  Brush should be asking  what are the broader forces at work behind the shift away from fossil fuels  How quickly will negative fossil fuel impacts on climate affect the fossil fuel companies in investor portfolios  Will the carbon related forces that are causing the extinction of a surprising number of animal species on Earth have an ironic reflexive effect  causing the extinction of companies I now hold 
Increasing Delta of Climate Change
Delta measures the degree to which an option price changes relative to shifts in the price of the underlying stock or commodity  As applied to climate change  you might look at your stock portfolio as a handful of options increasingly influenced by the rate of climate change  Which is to say that the rate of change of the physical world may soon approximate the rate of change in the internet world  where mega companies can now arise  and sometimes disappear  in a mere ten years 
Here are a few anecdotal indications to paint a clearer picture of the world you are living and investing in today 
NASA reports three inch sea level rise since 1992  with the rate of the rise increasing   People need to understand that the planet is not only changing  it s changed   NASA scientist Tom Wagner told reporters on a conference call  It was only four years ago that the question was asked  here at AllaboutAlpha  is it worth washing away your Hamptons beach house just to make a few bucks on carbon emitters 
Major corporate movement in support of climate change solutions  Companies like Gap  NYSE GPS   eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   Mars  KB Home  NYSE KBH  and Dignity Health are supporting a California state bill to reduce petroleum use by 50   Dignity Health said   Climate change threatens to undermine 50 years of advancement in population health   The oil industry is opposed 
Firefighters are seeing material changes in nature and generation of wildfires in the western United States  These brave gentlemen have a unique perspective on the problems generated by a changing climate  dealing with it in the most intimate terms 
Climate change affects electric grid reliability   According to the U S  Department of Energy  or DOE  extreme weather is  a leading environmental risk  to electricity transmission  storage  and distribution systems   as per this linked report 
Citibank says that the cost of not acting on climate change is  44 trillion  As reported on CNBC  That s trillion with a  t   But seriously  folks  they re bankers  not scientists  Some US investors might follow the line that GOP presidential candidates are fond of saying  and ask  they re not scientists  so how could they possibly know 
Reuters reports   Global food shortages will become three times more likely as a result of climate change and the international community needs to be ready to respond to price shocks to prevent civil unrest  a joint U S  British taskforce warned on Friday   This is in line with the US Defense Department s highlight of climate change as a national security threat for this reason  among others 
Climate Change   Opportunity and Changes in Assumptions
Naomi Klein s recent book This Changes Everything  which explores the effects of and solutions to climate change from a different perspective  This  will give you a quick take on the essence of the book  although it will raise a larger question too  noted in the book s subtitle  Capitalism vs  the Climate  
To us  the entire debate about the rights of companies versus individuals is neatly summed up in the actions of ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  ceo Rex Tillerson recently  The WSJ reported in early 2014 that Mr  Tillerson had joined in a suit objecting to construction of a water tower designed to provide water for nearby fracking operations  According to the WSJ   The tower would be almost 15 stories tall  adjacent to the 83 acre horse ranch Mr  Tillerson and his wife own and a short distance from their 18 acre homestead  Mr  Tillerson sat for a three hour deposition in the lawsuit last May  attended an all day mediation session in September and has spoken out against the tower during at least two Town Council meetings  according to public records and people involved with the case   News of Mr  Tillerson s participation in the suit was reported also in Forbes  Reuters  and USA Today  among other sources  It was not as widely broadcast that he subsequently dropped from the suit  Since he didn t publicly comment  it s impossible to say whether he was embarrassed by the apparent hypocrisy of objecting to actions he oversees at Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  when those same actions affect him negatively at a personal level  Being a CEO is  after all  hard work with many difficult decisions 
Apart from the ethical conflicts for any investors burdened with ethics  this is a story of market forces which seem likely to overwhelm a rear guard action by the fossil fuel interests  As you can see from a small sample of news in the last week  climate science has effects on almost everything in your investment portfolio   from beach property to healthcare  from fossil fuels to agriculture  You may not be able to find a single industry sector where climate change is not a primary future influence  So you had best start working on algorithms to sort out where the winners and losers are from a global influence of which some of your peers are blithely unaware 
At the end of the day  much of the movement behind the divestment of fossil fuels from institutional portfolios is based on the notion that it s the right thing to do from the standpoint of all humanity  This is in conflict with the portfolio manager s mandate to invest only for those humans who are also clients  not all humanity  But  O Thou who desirest to outperform your peers  you may find your portfolio reflecting the humanistic view as you begin to see the connection between the events mentioned earlier and the stock prices you watch dancing on your screen every day  Your future success as an investor will likely be aligned with the forces recognizing climate change as a serious threat to human quality of life  Buying into the fossil fuel narrative might well leave you in the position of the Woody Allen investment character who was in the business of  managing the money till it was all gone  ",2015-09-15,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-canary-in-the-coal-stocks-and-fossil-fuel-divestment-265037,265037

LGIH reported record results for a single month in December  2015  433 closed homes  These strong results closed out a record setting quarter of 946 homes which in turn closed a record setting year of 3 404 home closings  LGIH achieved 44  year over year growth in home closings  LGIH remains bullish for 2016 although the growth rate will likely be lot lower  LGIH s presented a base case for 17 5  year over year growth to at least 4000 home closings  assuming that general economic conditions  including interest rates  and mortgage availability in 2016 are similar to those in 2015   More importantly  these bullish expectations suggest that LGIH s efforts to diversify away from Texas  and Houston in particular  will continue to bear fruit  Moreover  even the Texas business may continue to show resilience to the on going collapse in the oil patch  LGIH now seems a lot more likely to pass the financial test of growth ahead 

Investors will have to wait until March 9th to get more details on the fourth quarter and 2016 guidance  but they did not wait to buy LGIH on the news 


LGI Homes  LGIH  continues to pivot around its 200 day moving average  DMI  after sharp sell off from all time highs 
LGIH gained 7 4  on the day although it was up as much as a whopping 15 4   This one day pop was just enough to take the edge off the recent month long sell off  Trading volume was very strong although still not matching the volume on the heavy selling days  Also note above that LGIH s intraday high of  25 on the day perfectly matched the intraday high from the attempted rally off previous lows  The stock closed right back on its 200 day moving average  DMA   a trendline that has become a pivot since mid December  LGIH s technical test remains unresolved as long as the stock continues to pivot around its 200 day moving average  DMA  

The sharp fade from highs was bad news for the momentum types who may have chased the stock higher on the day  However  the performance was impressive on a day where the S P 500  N SPY  closed with a 1 1  loss and a 3 month low  The ETF for home builders  iShares US Home Construction  N ITB   fared even worse with a 2 2  loss on the day  ITB last closed this low in December  2014  The selling has a lot to do with a poor earnings report from KB Home  N KBH  


ITB has quickly fallen from the top of 2015 s trading range to what is now a 13 month low 
ITB has turned from a relative out performer to a relative under performer  Given the ITB is just as over stretched to the downside as the S P 500  I expect an imminent relief rally in the index to push ITB higher  LGIH should benefit as well  However  I do not expect LGIH to break through looming overhead resistance at its 50DMA until at least the next earnings report can confirm bullish guidance for 2016

130867,352382,KBH,Housing Market Stocks In Retreat As Recession Fears Grow ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data released in December  2015  At the time  I saw the market coiling like a spring  Instead of springing forth  housing market stocks are in big retreat  Recession fears likely have a lot to do with the declines  The iShares US Home Construction  N ITB  is now down a gut wrenching 18  year to date  ITB trades at levels last seen October  2014  The S P 500  N SPY  is trading at the same relative level  but it has  only  declined 9  year to date 
iShares US Home Construction  ITB  has had a very rough start to the year even in the wake of relatively good housing data 
Ironically  the housing data for 2015 that preceded ITB s plunge set post recession records across the board 
   December  2015 Privately owned housing starts for 1 unit structures came in at 768 000  The November 1 unit starts were revised upward to 794 000 and became the new post recession record  This beat out the previous record of 758 000 hit in July  2015

The 6 1  year over year gain and 3 3  month over month drop are consistent with the mixed picture from the confidence of home builders  see below   The Northeast led the regions with a 25 0  year over year gain  The West and the South followed with 10 4  and 10 0  gains respectively  The Midwest lagged again  this time with a very large 18 9  drop  The poor performance from the Midwest stands in stark contrast to the slowdown drop I keep expecting to see in the South region because of Texas 
The solid end to the year selaed the deal on the strongest full year since the financial crisis and recession  Of course  starts are still at recessionary levels  but the trend and momentum continue to be encouraging

The strong uptick in sales punched new home sales inventory from 5 7 months at the current sales rate to 5 2 months  Six months is typically considered balanced  The Midwest sticks out with a 38 9  year over year gain in sales which stands in stark contrast with the on going lackluster starts data in the region  The West came in second with a 21 9  year over year gain  The South was exactly flat  and the Northeast fell by 6 5   Texas is a large part of the story of the South  so it is very possible the flat performance is indicative of a Texas housing market that is finally slowing down  I will be watching this as closely as ever 
The solid end to 2015 put annual sales at 501 000  This 14 5  year over year gain set a new post recession record for annual sales  The recovery picked up pace again as sales finally went over levels last seen in 2008

The National Association of Realtors  NAR  apparently correctly blamed November s plunge in existing sales on a regulatory air pocket   Know Before You Owe    Sales came roaring back in December with a 7 7  year over year gain  The NAR described the 14 7  month over month increase as the largest on record  but this was of course a result of the extraordinary drop that occurred in November  Like starts and new home sales  existing home sales ended 2015 on a strong note  Annual sales have not been this high since 2006

The surge in sales came at a cost  The inventory of existing homes for sale dropped sharply to a 3 9 month supply  This is the lowest rate since January  2005 when it stood at 3 6   Hopefully the market will soon come into better balance as the residual impact of the regulatory hiccup works its way through the system  Inventory was 5 1 months of sales in November  The drop in supply is one factor that has moderated the expectations for 2016 of NAR s chief economist Lawrence Yun 

 Although some growth is expected  the housing market will struggle in 2016 to replicate last year s 7 percent increase in sales In addition to insufficient supply levels  the overall pace of sales this year will be constricted by tepid economic expansion  rising mortgage rates and decreasing demand for buying in oil producing metro areas  

The story for first time home buyers is also very lukewarm  The annual share of 30  for first timers is only up one percentage point from 2013 and 2014  This is the final confirmation of my expectations that new home buyers would make no progress in 2015 

Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index  January  2016
The Housing Market Index  HMI  stayed flat with a downwardly revised December index at 60  This flat performance of the overall index hides a stark divergence between current and future sales conditions  Current sales conditions rose 2 points to 67 while sales expectations 6 months out dropped a surprising 3 points to 63  The component for buyer traffic also fell  The chart below shows the rarity of this kind of divergence  I will be watching carefully to see whether the drops continue  They could provide a leading indicator even as current conditions look good 

The Housing Market Index continues its divergence from consumer confidence with the component for sales six months out showing a particularly bad drop 
The three month moving averages for regional HMI scores declined in all four regions of the country  There must be some rounding error given the overall index was flat with the previous month  Regardless  the broad decline has my attention as well as the breakdown of the individual components 
Parting thoughts The strong housing numbers of 2015 augur well for the Spring selling season  The extremely weak performance of ITB this year contrasts greatly with the strong 2015 performance  Unfortunately  the earnings of home builders have not boosted confidence in the market  For example  KB Home  N KBH  p  Meritage Corporation  N MTH  delivered earnings on January 28  2016 that sent the stock soaring 14  off prices last seen in mid 2012  However  those gains have almost all reversed as the stock failed to gain any follow through momentum  The home builder confidence for January also presents cause for pause given the drop in expectations for future sales  Finally  the NAR s chief economist clearly has put a lid on expectations for 2016 s housing market 
So I think of the housing market at an important crossroads with strong results from the rear but an ever more shadowy outlook ahead  The market is racing to try to price in some kind of economic slowdown or even recession and generating some extremely cheap home builder stocks  I am treating this as a buying opportunity even as I remain wary about the overall stock market  Assuming no recession is forthcoming  the stocks of home builders should deliver tremendous upside over the balance of this year  The upside may push out into early 2017 given the seasonal strength in home builder stocks typically ends with the Spring selling season

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  is making a well deserved comeback 
GDP On Friday  February 26th  the U S  Department of Commerce s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported   Q4 GDP includes a continuing strong performance for domestic private residential investment  Since Q4 of 2014  the quarterly percentage changes have ranged from 8 to 10    very healthy numbers  These numbers are not surprising given the other strong results for 2015 

Strong growth in residential gross private domestic investment for the last five quarters
   January  2016 Privately owned housing starts for 1 unit structures came in at 731 000  The December 1 unit starts were revised slightly downward to 761 000  These numbers are well within the on going uptrend in housing starts

The 3 5  year over year gain and 3 9  month over month drop are consistent with another mixed picture from the confidence of home builders  see below   The South led the regions with the only positive year over year gain at 10 7   The South region includes Texas and thus continues to show remarkable resilience in the face of the collapse of the oil patch  The West led decliners with a 6 7  drop 
The overall trend and momentum for housing starts continue to encourage me 
New Residential Sales   January  2016 New single family home sales came in weak at 494 000  The 5 2  year over year drop and 9 2  monthly drop was a marked contrast from the year over year and monthly gains from the report on December  2015  This performance places new home sales into a potential range that could soon contrast with the rising trend in starts 
New home sales may be stalling   sales for the Spring selling season will be critical to matching up with rising housing starts 
Source  US  Bureau of the Census  New One Family Houses Sold  United States  HSN1F   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  March 6  2016 
The drop in sales brought new home inventory from 5 2 months to 5 8  This more in line with the six months typically considered balanced  Hopefully  the boost in availability will get more sales going in the coming months  The Northeast bucked the trend for the month with a surge in sales which increased 100  from year ago levels  This was a direct contrast to December s 6 5  year over year drop  So  the Northeast is likely just being volatile  The Midwest and the South had low single digit losses  The sales in the South are continuing to slow down  so I remain on alert for Texas despite the strong showing for housing starts in the South  The West was the region that really drove the plunge in new home sales with a 24 1  year over year drop  Given this was a flip flop from December s 21 9  year over year surge  I will cause this performance a wash 
Existing Home Sales   January  2016
Existing home sales performed a lot better than new home sales  The National Association of Realtors  NAR  reported  Existing home sales crept forward in January to the highest annual rate in six months  and subpar supply levels propelled price growth to the fastest increase since last April The West was the only region to see a decline in sales in January   On a year over year basis  existing home sales increased a very healthy 11 0   This is the best year over year performance since the 16 3  gain in July  2013  The robust sales for existing homes gives me confidence that new home sales will pick up again soon

Although housing inventory increased 3 4  from the prior month this is still down 2 2  from a year ago  Months of inventory nudged up from 3 9 to 4 0 months  Last months inventory was the lowest since 3 6 months of supply in January  2005  This inventory is far too low for a balanced market and is contributing to blistering price increases  The 8 2  year over year jump in the median sales price was the highest since April  2015  Prices have climbed for 47 straight months  The low supply and surging prices are causing concern for NAR s chief economist Lawrence Yun regarding the Spring selling season 

 The spring buying season is right around the corner and current supply levels aren t even close to what s needed to accommodate the subsequent growth in housing demand Home prices ascending near or above double digit appreciation aren t healthy   especially considering the fact that household income and wages are barely rising  

The poor inventory and price environment has not detered first time homebuyers at least  They represent 32  of the market which is up from 28  in January  2015 


Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index  February  2016
The Housing Market Index  HMI  dropped to 58 in February  In the last Housing Market Review  I cited a rare and troubling divergence between current and future sales conditions  In February  current conditions  finally responded with a three point dip from 68 to 65  Sales expectations 6 months stabilized a bit by increasing by a point  However  the component for buyer traffic plunged  This component has not been this low since May  2015  So once again  the HMI is sending mixed messages which provide a tight cap on my optimism for the Spring selling season  The NAHB s explanations are as usual inadequate  The group claims that builders are reflecting consumer concerns yet consumer confidence has stabilized in recent months and remains at lofty levels

The three month moving averages for regional HMI scores declined again in all four regions of the country  This broad decline continues to grab my attention along with the breakdown of the individual components 
Parting thoughts I earlier thought the strong housing numbers of 2015 augured well for the Spring selling season  The HMI in particular has tempered my expectations  I find it ironic that ITB is moving higher against what I see as yellow flags when it was declining a month ago amid what I thought were hopeful signs  Fortunately  my previous optimism paid off in some timely purchases in a range of home builder shares and call options  The big drops and some low valuations to start the year had me salivating for good entry points

The regions were very mixed in performance  The Northeast cooled off from last month s 100  year over year gain to a 3 8  drop in February  The Northeast s extreme volatility continues  The Midwest and the West were the two regions with gains over last year s February  1 9  and 10 2  respectively  The West bounced back sharply from January s monthly 24 1  year over year drop  The South had the largest yearly loss at  14 3   This poor performance puts me on full alert for Texas 
Existing Home Sales   February  2016
Whereas existing home sales performed a lot better than new home sales in January  this time  existing home sales were weak alongside new home sales  You know the data must be disappointing when the National Association of Realtors  NAR  uses a title like  Existing Home Sales Fizzle in February   The NAR reported 

 The lull in contract signings in January from the large East Coast blizzard  along with the slump in the stock market  may have played a role in February s lack of closings  However  the main issue continues to be a supply and affordability problem  Finding the right property at an affordable price is burdening many potential buyers 
The overall demand for buying is still solid entering the busy spring season  but home prices and rents outpacing wages and anxiety about the health of the economy are holding back a segment of would be buyers  

I am wondering whether it is also possible that a lot of demand was pulled forward into January for some reason  January s existing sales were last that high six months prior  On a year over year basis  February s existing home sales still increased 2 2   but they dropped 7 1  from January  This is not the kind of momentum expected or desired going into the Spring selling season  However  if there was some kind of pull forward effect in January  then February should look like a blip as the season pushes into March and April  We will see soon 

While disappointing on a sequential basis  existing home sales are still up from a year ago

 At the time of retrieval  for some reason  data were only available back to 2013  
Although housing inventory increased 3 3  from the prior month  inventory is still down 1 1  from a year ago  Months of inventory increased from 4 0 months to 4 4 months  still far short of the 6 months typically indicative of a balanced market  Recall that December s inventory of 3 9 months was the lowest since 3 6 months of supply in January  2005  Despite ever increasing prices  the supply side of the market is still not responding  However  this lack of response helps to explain the ability of home builders to steadily increase housing starts as shown above  February s 4 4  year over year increase in the median price of an existing home represents the 48th consecutive month of year over year increases 
Interestingly  individual investors bought 18  of existing homes in February  surpassing January s 17  share and well above a trough of 12  in August  2015  The participation rate of these investors is back to levels last seen in April  2014 and defies recent fears of a retreat of investors from the housing market that could also signal a top 
On the other hand  first time homebuyers are still stuck in neutral  Their share of purchases fell from 32  in January to 30  in February  This participation rate is still up from the 29  seen in February  2015 


Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index  March  2016
After a worrisome February  the Housing Market Index  HMI  stabilized at 58 for March  In the last Housing Market Review  I cited a rare and troubling divergence between current and future sales conditions  In February  current conditions  finally responded with a three point dip from 68 to 65  For March s reading  the overall stabilization hides a continued drop in sales expectations for the 6 months while expectations for traffic increased enough to compensate  I am more concerned with the on going drop in sales expectations than the apparent stabilization of prospective traffic  I will be very eager to see how these components respond through the Spring selling season 

Sentiment on prospective sales is the component to watch  It needs to stop going down here and soon 
 The March reading for Consumer Confidence was not ready at the time of writing 
In February  the three month moving averages for regional HMI scores declined in all four regions of the country  This month the numbers were more mixed    the Midwest posted a one point gain to 58 while the South was unchanged at 59  The West registered a three point decline to 69 while the Northeast fell one point to 46  
Parting thoughts I earlier thought the strong housing numbers of 2015 augured well for the Spring selling season  First  the HMI tempered my expectations  Next  it was new home sales  Now  it is existing home sales  The momentum has clearly slowed for the housing market  Normally  I would then look at the steady increase in housing starts as a cause for outright alarm  Yet  overall housing inventories are low and median home prices keep marching ever upward  So  overall  the prospect for increased housing supply is a good thing for now 
With the Spring selling season getting started  the seasonal trade on home builders has essentially come to an end  That reality combined with all this slowing momentum motivated me to close out a few more of my trades on home builders  I am exercising an abundance of caution while still looking out for the next opportunity to buy on dips 
The charts below show that the seasonal trade on home builders is performing at its worst since 2009 on an absolute and relative basis  compared to the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY

130893,352408,KBH,Here s Why There Is A Good Chance KB Home Will Crush Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"KB Home NYSE KBH  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings before the market opens on Friday  June 27th  KB Home is an American home building company  The previous housing starts economic indicator data revealed that new home starts came in about 50 000 homes fewer than expected  However the previous period reported in May came in well above expectations  This quarter Wall Street is expecting KB Home to report a significant increase in FQ2 EPS and for a 4  boost in year over years sales  Here s what investors are expecting from KB Home on Friday 

The information below is derived from data submitted to the platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for KB Homes to report 21c EPS and  547 64M revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 23c EPS and  564 36M in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting KB Home to beat the Wall Street consensus on the top and bottom line by a moderate margin 
Over the previous 5 quarters for which data is available the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting KB Home s EPS in each quarter and has been more accurate in predicting revenue 3 times  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a moderate differential between the two groups  expectations compared to previous quarters 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 20c to 27c per share and from  540 48M to  608 00M in revenues  This quarter we re seeing an average range of estimates on KB Home compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of earnings estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months the Wall Street earnings consensus rose from 19c to 21c while the Estimize consensus started and ended the period at 23c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast climbed from  521 05M to  547 64M while the Estimize sales consensus dipped from  568 60M to  564 36M  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a leading indicator  In this case we see a lite decline in consensus at the end of the quarter which can be a bearish indicator 

Among the analysts with   ZachLehner has been the most accurate with an average of 14 00 points per estimate  ZachLehner is an independent financial research professional who is ranked 6th overall among over 4 550 contributing analysts  This season ZachLehner has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 63  and 57  of the time respectively throughout 30 estimates 

On Friday the Estimize community expects KB Home to report a significantly better quarter than Wall Street is looking for  Housing starts data has been up and down  but on Thursday rival Lennar Corp  posted great quarterly results  signaling a strong home building industry  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are forecasting that KB Home will beat the Wall Street consensus by 2c per share in earnings and nearly  17 million in sales

130916,352431,KBH,Five Real Estate Investments Wall Street Isn t Talking About,opinion,Over the last two days  I ve demonstrated that the stage is set for a multi year recovery in real estate  The problem is  the obvious  and overcrowded  plays don t hold the most profit potential anymore  Individual homebuilding stocks  such as PulteGroup     KB Home    and Lennar Corp      have experienced meteoric rises over the last 18 months  Homebuilding exchange traded funds  which hold a basket of stocks  have enjoyed triple digit price increases  too  The two most popular real estate ETFs  the SPDR Homebuilders ETF    and the iShares Dow Jones Home Construction ETF     are up 110  and 150  respectively  from the August 2011 lows  The run up isn t limited to homebuilding stocks and ETFs  either  Many REITs are also enjoying solid upticks  As Charles Lieberman  of Advisors Capital Management  recently told Barron s   The popular parts of the REIT space  have been bid up by investors desperate for yield  and they no longer look attractive   That s to be expected  though  isn t it  I mean  the obvious beneficiaries of a recovery always get bid up first  However  the fact that homebuilding  stocks have made big moves and aren t cheap anymore   as O Hare cautions  doesn t mean the recovery is finished  Far from it  We simply need to adjust the way we go about profiting from it  The Hunt for the Next Big Real Estate Play Ends Here Let me be clear  I m not recommending selling out of any of the investments mentioned above  After all  it s common for stock prices to go much higher than anyone rationally predicts  What I m recommending  instead  is trimming up your stops on the most prominent housing plays  More importantly  I m recommending that you put new money to work in the sector by doing some extra research  That way  you can find investments that haven t even come close to rising  too far  too fast   as pundits  including mainstream ones at   warn  Now  if you find that you re allergic to extra work  you re in luck  I ve compiled a short list of such companies for you to consider  These companies run the gamut from construction material manufacturers to title insurance providers  I even uncovered a Canadian company   with meaningful exposure to the U S  real estate market As you can see  all of the companies are cheaper than the major homebuilding ETFs based on at least two valuation metrics   if not all three  And except for one  they haven t risen nearly as fast  either One more thing   none of the stocks above are currently holdings in either of the two major real estate ETFs  So there s no chance that everyday investors will somehow stumble upon them by simply pulling up the most recent holdings in each fund  It ll take them some time to get a clue By the time they figure it out  though  we ll hopefully be sitting on some handsome profits Time will tell  of course  So rest assured  I ll check back in on the group in about six months to see how each company is performing   Yes  I believe in holding myself accountable  Bottom line  Pointing to the rapid rise of homebuilding stocks as proof that the real estate recovery has run out of steam is a myopic and costly assessment  Many more real estate profits lie ahead To uncover them  all we need to do is take the time to find lesser known companies with meaningful leverage to the recovery  If other investors are too lazy to do the same  that s their problem  not ours ,2013-02-28,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/five-real-estate-investments-wall-street-isn’t-talking-about-157076,157076

130950,352465,KBH,Home Builders May Be Affected By Fiscal Cliff,opinion,The home builder stocks have been one of the best performing stock sectors over the past year  This industry group really emerged as a market leading sector October 4  2011 when the major stock indexes put in a significant low  Since that time  leading home builder stocks such as Toll Brothers Inc  TOL   and Lennar Corp   LEN  have increased by more than 100 0   This sector has also provided an increase in construction jobs which has helped this economy over the past year  Should the home builder sector start to decline in 2013 it could be signaling some serious problems for the U S  economy  One of the primary drivers for the home builder sector has been the artificially low interest rates that are being created by the Federal Reserve  The central bank has been buying  40 billion worth of mortgage backed securities  MBS  a month since it announced it s latest QE 3 program  Earlier today  a report was released that stated home buyers are coming back as contracts for October increased by 5 2  from a month earlier  This is once again being aided by low interest rates  The 30 year fixed mortgage is now at 3 40   which is an all time low The Mortgage Tax Credit  Third Rail  Now everyone knows that the fiscal cliff in the United States is looming  Many politicians have announced that they would like to cut the mortgage interest tax credit  If that tax credit were to end it could once again cause home prices to decline  Many first time home buyers depend on that tax credit as a major incentive to invest in a home  We shall see what the politicians do when it comes to this important tax credit  A strong case can be made that the housing sector must be revived if the United States is to have any sustainable recovery  manufacturing is certainly not going to do it   Today  most leading home builder stocks are trading higher on the day  Leading home builder equities such as DR Horton Inc  KB Home  KBH   and Beazer Homes USA Inc   BZH  are all trading higher on the session  The near term problem with the home builder stocks is that they are now all trading below the important and psychological 50 day moving average  Until this moving average is recaptured with conviction on the charts the sector looks vulnerable for a correction over the next couple of months ,2012-11-29,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-builders-may-be-affected-by-fiscal-cliff-145548,145548
130953,352468,KBH,10 Signs We re Not In Another Real Estate Bubble,opinion,Over at Yahoo  Finance  the headline for one of the most popular articles screams   Housing Already Shows Signs of a New Bubble   The exact same sentiment is being shouted from the rooftops at Forbes  too   Home Builders Could Become Heartbreakers Again   We re less than one year into a legitimate recovery in prices  and already the pundits can t help but sound the alarm about another possible  bubble   Give me a break  Forget Rodney Dangerfield  the residential real estate rebound gets  no respect   Don t worry  We re nowhere close to another peak  Nor has the profit potential for housing related investments suddenly vanished  Here are 10 hard facts to prove it  1  Too Far  Too Fast  Nope  Housing market bears point to the meteoric rise of homebuilding stocks as proof that the recovery has been too robust  too soon  The S P 1500 Homebuilder group is up 170  since hitting a low in August 2011  In the last year alone  many individual homebuilder stocks  like KB Home  KBH   PulteGroup Inc   PHM  and Ryland Group  RYL   doubled in price  As Bespoke Investment Group aptly points out  though   Remember that  too far  too fast  is relative   And  in this case  short term relativity can be deceiving  It turns out that the S P 1500 Homebuilder group is still down 55  from its 2005 high  despite the impressive run up over the last 18 months  Too far  too fast  I don t think so  2  Peak Activity  Nope  Actual homebuilding and sales activity haven t peaked  either  Based on the January data  single family housing starts remain almost 200  below the peak hit during the last boom  And they re more than 60  below the long term average since 1962  As far as existing home sales  we re still about 40  below peak levels  3  RFI is Back in the Black  Ever since 2005  the real estate market has been a drag on the U S  economy  More specifically  residential fixed investment  RFI  weakened GDP growth  Not anymore  In the fourth quarter  RFI added 0 4  to GDP growth  In dollar terms  RFI needs to increase another 40  just to hit the long term average since 1995  So forget being near a top  The latest data indicates that  the housing rebound is fairly entrenched at this point   as RBS Securities  economist  Omair Sharif  puts it  Entrenched  with plenty of room to run  too  4  Less Distressed  Any talk about the housing market wouldn t be complete without mentioning the unending onslaught of foreclosures and short sales  which naturally hold back a recovery   particularly in prices  But  surprise  surprise   distressed sales  are becoming less and less of a factor  Notices of defaults  scheduled auctions  bank repossessions and other filings fell 28  in the last year  according to RealtyTrac  Perhaps even more telling is the fact that new foreclosure filings are at their lowest levels since June 2006  As RealtyTrac s Daren Blomquist says   We re now well past the peak of the foreclosure crisis   I ll say  In all fairness  foreclosure filings are still running hot   at about twice the pace experienced in 2005  But we can t overlook the progress being made  In many hard hit markets  foreclosure sales now account for a dramatically smaller portion of the market  see table below   Take Las Vegas  for instance  In January 2012  foreclosures accounted for a staggering 45 5  of sales  Fast forward to today  though  and that figure has been more than cut in half  to 12 5   according to calculations by economist  Thomas Lawler  If we look at the short sale data  a similar trend is developing  too Add it all up  and as Bill McBride of Calculatedriskblog com says   In every area that reports distressed sales  the share of distressed sales is down year over year   and down significantly in most areas  That means conventional sales are picking up  which is  a major continued improvement for the market   according to Trulia com s Chief Economist  Jed Kolko  I agree And once again  the data points to a market on the mend  not in bubble territory 5  No More Negative Equity for You Aside from short sales and foreclosures  the other main factor holding back the real estate market has been the number of homeowners sidelined because of negative equity  But that s becoming less and less of an issue  too Thanks to rising prices  nearly two million homeowners were freed from negative equity over the last year  according to a report from Zillow Of course  the number of homeowners underwater remains high  at about 13 8 million  But that just means the real estate recovery has much more room for progress That s it for today  In tomorrow s column  I ll share five more signs   backed up by hard data   that the real estate recovery is here to stay  I ll also share a handful of ways to profit from the continued boom  So stay tuned ,2013-02-26,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/10-signs-we’re-not-in-another-real-estate-bubble-156712,156712
