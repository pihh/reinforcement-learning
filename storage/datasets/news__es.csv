1334,222849,ES,The Big Squeeze  This election year  it s all about the money,news,"By James Oliphant MIDDLETOWN  CONN    Two years ago  Judy Konopka and Craig Diangelo lost their jobs in the IT department of what was then known as  Northeast Utilities   NYSE ES   a regional electricity provider  when the company decided to replace about 220 employees with guest workers from India  In order to receive a more lucrative separation package  they had to train their foreign replacements both here and overseas  Both had trouble finding new work  Konopka  56  is still looking  Diangelo  64  is working as a contractor for a company that provides no benefits  making substantially less than he did before  He views himself as a victim of globalization  a casualty of offshoring and he credits Donald Trump  the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has cast himself as the champion of displaced and disaffected U S  workers  for bringing the issue to light   I ll vote for him   says Diangelo  over dinner at a Thai restaurant on this town s Main Street  Two others at the table murmur in assent  He continues  his voice rising   I wasn t planning on retiring early  I wasn t planning on making  35 000 less  I ve had to cut back a lot  I basically live paycheck to paycheck    I could never vote for Hillary Clinton   Diangelo says  citing Clinton s support of the North American Free Trade Agreement  passed while her husband  Bill  was president  as well as her advocacy of the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership  a trade pact that s still being negotiated by the Obama administration   Challenged by Bernie Sanders  Clinton has since retracted her support of TPP   Even Konopka  who favors Clinton  she calls Trump  the biggest idiot    has to admit Clinton s support of trade deals such as NAFTA gives her pause  When Northeast Utilities fired her after 21 years   I felt betrayed   Konopka took advantage of a federal trade assistance program to improve her skills in web design  then discovered she couldn t compete with designers outside the country who were willing to work for much less  Now  to get by  she sells vintage books on the web   It s starting to get really scary   she says  This presidential election is  purportedly  the Year of the Angry Voter  with images of scuffles at Trump rallies occupying cable news screens  But as befitting someone who lives in a place called Middletown  Konopka is more typical of voters  consumed by a stomach churning uncertainty  a vague sense of something lost  and an inescapable belief that an array of powerful forces corporations  politicians  government aren t looking out for them  Economists and pundits have been struggling to explain why  with unemployment below 5 percent and a bounty of positive economic indicators  voters seem so dismayed  so distrustful  It might be something as simple as bargaining power  In his best known book  The Art of the Deal  Trump advises every negotiator to  use your leverage   But increasingly  U S  workers  white and blue collar alike  feel they have none  They ve seen their power erode as they are tossed into a global labor pool  as companies consolidate and shed jobs to please Wall Street  as unions wither  state budgets tighten  technology advances and iconic brands such as Nabisco pack up and move to Mexico  The squeeze is on   There s a feeling among workers that not only are they replaceable  but that they will be replaced   says Gary Chaison  a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in nearby Worcester  Massachusetts   That there is no security anymore  that someone is making a profit by letting them go    Trump   he adds   has tapped into that very well   According to Reuters Ipsos polling  71 percent of Trump supporters either have had to take a lower paying job in the last few years  have a family member who has had to do so  or have a family member whose home has been threatened by foreclosure  In a sign of how widespread the phenomenon has become  63 percent of Clinton supporters reported the same dismal tally   People feel more insecure about trade than terrorism   Chaison tells me   Everyone knows someone who has lost their job   What bothers Diangelo most is that he was let go by a company that still valued his skill just not him   The sad part is that my job is still there   he says   It didn t go away  I went away   CANDIDATES IN HARD HATS None of this should feel particularly new  The United States has been bleeding middle class workers especially in the industrial and manufacturing sectors as long as Bruce Springsteen has been around to sing about it  Candidates adorned with hard hats vowing to bring back factory jobs have become a set piece of modern politics  The United States has lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years as the trade deficit has mushroomed  according to the Economic Policy Institute  a liberal think tank in Washington  Wage growth in almost all sectors has flatlined over that time  including for the bottom 70 percent of fouryear college graduates  and growth overall has been anemic  at under 2 percent  And while the 9 million jobs vaporized in the flash of the Great Recession have been recovered  the majority of them are of lesser quality than the ones they replaced  Perhaps most fundamentally  the relationship between employee and employer has shifted  Workers  share of the pie has decreased substantially since the 1970s  when the country s corporate and industrial base began to erode  Last year  workers  share dropped to 75 5 percent of corporate income  even as technology has made workforces more productive and efficient  U S  corporate profits  meantime  returned to pre recession levels in 2012  Workers  sense that the recovery is only partial  It helps employers more than it helps workers   Chaison says  If workers  sense of slippage seems familiar  the way their discontent is rippling through our politics feels newly transformative  Voters threw out the Republicans running Congress in 2006  then two years later elected the first African American president  an outsider who vowed reform  Souring on him  they replaced Democrats then controlling Congress with another set of Republicans in 2010 and 2014  making governance as unstable as the business sector  In a period of war  terrorism and economic chaos  all that churn might best be viewed as a deeply frustrated electorate trying to use what little leverage they have to change a system they consider to be otherwise unaccountable  Trump has been the main beneficiary of that frustration  He makes those in the crowd feel like they matter  that they finally have a bully of their own who can push back at what they view as an alliance of unprincipled corporate culture and an enabling government   You re looking at a situation where the jobs are being ripped out of our states  out of our country  like candy from a baby   Trump said at a rally this spring  It has been Trump  along with Democrat Sanders  who has pushed the issue of job losses to countries such as China  Mexico and India to the forefront  Trump has threatened to slap a tax on imports and tear up trade deals  In Indiana earlier this year  he ripped air conditioner manufacturer Carrier for announcing it would lay off 2 100 workers and move its operations to Mexico  He gave Nabisco the same treatment  pledging he would no longer eat Oreos  He has slammed companies such as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Boeing  NYSE BA  for their overseas operations  as well  Few presidential candidates have such temerity to challenge well known American brands  but clearly it is resonating   They might not like everything he says  but they believe he says what he thinks   Lewis Gossett  president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance  told me last summer   I think we re repeating a time in history when the very rich are removed from the very poor    TWO TYPES OF CEO MINDSETS  Michael Smith is one of the Americans Trump rallies for  Smith was among 600 Nabisco employees laid off at the bakery on Chicago s South Side earlier this year  after the company announced it was transferring some work to Mexico  He got the news at 3 a m   It was   Smith tells me   a dark night when all your livelihood passes in front of you  and you feel like you ve been given the royal shaft   Smith operated the machines that wrapped Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers  With overtime  he could clear  85 000 a year  He s 59 and wasn t thinking he would have to re enter the job market  The day before  Smith had shown up at a shareholders meeting in Chicago to confront Irene Rosenfeld  the chief executive of Mondelez International  the holding company that oversees the Nabisco brand  about the move to Mexico  While sympathetic  Rosenfeld said it was her duty to maximize the corporation s value to its shareholders worldwide by cutting costs   There are two types of CEO mindsets   Smith responded   those who care about shareholders and those who care about the shareholders and the people   In our conversation  Smith didn t begrudge the company s legal right to relocate the jobs  but he questions a CEO who earned more than  40 million in compensation over the last two years exhorting the virtues of cost cutting to a room full of laid off blue collar workers   That s not good citizenship   he says   Wealth comes from the workers  That profitability comes from us   Clinton met with a small group of the Nabisco workers in March  the day before the Illinois primary  But the visit didn t leave Smith with much hope that as president she could do much either for the workers  situation or to reverse the demands of a globalized economy  In part  that s due to Clinton s support of NAFTA  which Smith terms an  infection   but also because of the lobbying might of Mondelez  a  30 billion company  and other big corporations  Smith is the unusual American voter who says he hasn t decided between Clinton and Trump  He ll focus on the election later  First  he has to keep his household afloat and his daughter in school at Columbia College in Chicago  He has six months  salary to cushion him  He s trying to stay optimistic about finding work  saying his wife and daughter are counting on him  But  he concedes   I think I have been a little bit in denial  Even people of faith have bouts of depression   PINK SLIPS Angela Valero gives a one word reply when I ask her about a potential Clinton Trump matchup   Ugh   I might as well be asking about who s going to win the next regatta on Mars  so far is the election from her daily concerns  Valero s dream job was to be a corrections officer  She was finally hired on by the state of Connecticut last fall  The single mother of an 8 year old girl thought that  at last  she had a reliable  stable position with benefits  But after completing an academy training course and being posted as a guard at the state maximum security facility in nearby Uncasville  she found out this spring that she was being laid off  a consequence of a decision made by Connecticut s Democratic governor  Dannel Malloy  and the state legislature to not raise taxes on the wealthy to cover a budget shortfall  Lawmakers worried that the state s richest residents would relocate to Florida  which has no state income tax  or other states with lower taxes  During the downturn  Connecticut lost a bevy of high paying jobs in the financial services sector in the corporate hub of Stamford and elsewhere  The jobs created during the recovery were less lucrative  resulting in lower tax revenue  In addition  the state was spooked when  General Electric   NYSE GE   responding to an effort by the legislature to raise business taxes  announced it was relocating its headquarters from Fairfield to Boston  Aetna  NYSE AET   the health insurer based in Hartford  also threatened to leave the state  That shelved any notion of new taxes  The state looked to trim its public workforce instead   Easy targets   says Lori Pelletier  president of the state AFL CIO  Rape counselors  child service workers  prison guards began receiving pink slips  Ultimately  2 500 or more state workers could be let go  Pelletier contrasted that with the 200 jobs GE is moving to Boston  something that drew substantial media attention  The state of Massachusetts and the city of Boston helped recruit GE with a generous benefit package  including  25 million in property tax relief for a corporation that critics have long held pays little in U S  taxes   Angela last year paid more taxes than GE   Pelletier says   And she s the one losing her job   Valero tells me she has little faith that anyone in Washington can help her  She doesn t sleep more than four hours a night  kept up by worrying about paying the electric bill and keeping her house  She has no idea whether she ll ever be recalled to work  Throughout the interview  she stays stoic  determined  like the corrections office she was trained to be  Only at the end of our conversation does she slip a bit   I held back the tears   she says with relief  CULLING AND CUTTING Ron Ozer greets me at the door with the sheepishness of someone who isn t used to being at home during the workday  Ozer  53  was laid off from DuPont  NYSE DD  Co  in January after a 23 year career  A Ph D in chemical engineering  he has more than 20 patents to his name  He worked on long term projects at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington  Delaware  one of the more storied research facilities in the country  where products such as nylon  Lycra and Kevlar were created   Some of the great developments in American industry came out of that site   Ozer says   It was a time when America was growing so dramatically   But a lack of growth and pressure from investors forced DuPont to announce a merger with another giant   Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW   In advance of the merger  it has begun to shed jobs  In Delaware alone  DuPont plans to dump 1 700 workers many in the area of long term research  which can be expensive without yielding immediate rewards to shareholders  Ozer s group was eviscerated  The  130 billion merger of DuPont and Dow blends two U S  companies that date back to the 19th century  Barry Lynn  an economist at the New America think tank  says that industry consolidation chills the labor market  sapping demand for skilled workers such as Ozer  Dominant companies can use their market power to charge customers more or make suppliers pay less all without having to grow and create jobs to survive  Indeed  the push from Wall Street is to cull and cut  not grow  And when companies do expand today it s largely through acquisition  not investment   That s a huge amount of the energy that s behind Trump   Lynn says   the sense of power being consolidated and being out of control and harming me and my family and my community   Ozer will try to take advantage of his contacts at DuPont to become a consultant  but admits that s a gamble  Asked if he thinks he can replicate the six figure salary he enjoyed at DuPont  he laughs   I m not confident of that   His chief concern is his two daughters  both of whom are out of college  In order to give his youngest a leg up in the market  he sent her to private Haverford College in Pennsylvania  tuition   46 000  going deep into debt to do so   I have a lot of possibilities  but I need things to start turning into dollars soon   he says  OUTSOURCING AND GLOBALIZATION For Sara Blackwell  representing U S  workers displaced by the federal H1 B visa program began as a gig  Now  it s a full blown cause  The Tampa lawyer has been giving away clients who would distract her from her work  She jokes she s stopped sleeping and exercising  Recently  she launched a website called ProtectUSworkers com   I speak to an average of 10 people a day who are victims of this   she tells me   The more I learn about this  the more I have to fight   She began by representing IT workers at Walt Disney World in Florida who were replaced by guest workers from India brought in on temporary visas by outsourcing firms that contracted with Disney  She has filed a long shot conspiracy lawsuit in federal court  Blackwell contends that the practice of outsourcing low end  back office IT jobs to cut costs has become endemic  Globalization  she says  is systematically lowering the standard of living of American workers   It s a race to the bottom   she says  The Disney case garnered the attention of some in the U S  Senate  including Jeff Sessions  a Republican from Alabama who now is at the forefront of a fight against the American tech industry  which wants to expand the guest worker program citing a lack of domestic qualified engineers and programmers  But those tech companies are at the back of the line  According to Ron Hira  a professor at Howard University who tracks applications  outsourcing firms have been crowding out tech companies in the race to acquire the highly coveted H1 B visas  which are capped at 85 000 a year  Sessions  who is also a fierce opponent of immigration reform  was one of the first U S  politicians to embrace Trump and Blackwell has spoken out against the program at several Trump rallies  She also has consulted with the outsourced employees who worked at Northeast Utilities in Connecticut  including Craig Diangelo  Part of Diangelo s frustration and part of what is driving him toward Trump is that Washington has done so little to curb what he views as abuses of the H1 B program  There is a greater push now on Capitol Hill to broaden the program rather than rein it in   There s nobody to help us   he tells me   There s nobody to say you can t do this   Richard Blumenthal  a U S  senator from Connecticut  has been part of efforts to expand the program  but also to reform it   It s a desperately serious problem   he says  He told me that even though there is some bipartisan consensus on reform  efforts still aren t moving forward  consumed by the same paralysis that s stalling everything else   There are powerful forces against us   Blumenthal says   including the companies that exploit these programs   
To Diangelo  that s the dilemma of the modern  middle class voter  He worked hard for years  lost his job when his only transgression was being too old and making too much money  was humiliated when he had to train his replacement  and then watched how state and federal politicians have been able to do nothing to help him  Why shouldn t he support Donald Trump  What s worth preserving  He s a tech worker  sipping Pinot Grigio over pad thai  He s no militant or conspiracist  Yet     There is going to be an uprising   he says   People are starting to say   I ve had enough of this  I ve really had enough   ",2016-08-02,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/the-big-squeeze:-this-election-year,-it’s-all-about-the-money-418039",418039

year  gaining  32 7  vs a  20 6  increase  courtesy of its impressive comps record  Comps have been gaining from continued rise in consumer traffic and strong merchandising policies The Zacks analyst thinks these factors along with TJX Companies  off price model  strategic store locations and impressive brands have been driving its store and online performance  This was visible in the company s third quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year and beat estimates  and customer traffic rose for the 17th straight time The company began the fourth quarter on a strong note  which along with its constant sales driving efforts  solid holiday season prospects and expected market share gains led to a raised view  However  the company has long been witnessing

136123,357638,ES,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Avoid Portfolio Losses,opinion,Debt financing is nothing new in the world of investment and only a fortunate few can avoid it  Most corporates resort to debt financing to ensure smooth business operations  This is because companies do not have unlimited funds and they need to boost their financial resources from time to time to expand operations In fact  given the easy availability and affordability of debt compared to equity  in the majority of matured economies  the debt market is bigger than the equity market in terms of market capitalization  America   the richest economy in the world   is the biggest borrower too However  resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments In this context  it is imperative to note that the debt scenario in the U S  is quite disturbing at this moment  Huge spending on wars  big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation s burden over the years  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150  of the economy s GDP in 2047 from 77  currently Nevertheless  this should not dissuade investors from investing in stocks as debt has been a part of the U S  economy since its foundation  What investors need to do is to follow a prudent investment strategy and choose stocks that are burdened with lesser amount of debt Herein comes the significance of financial leverage ratio  This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage  or the extent of debt a company bears  Several leverage ratios have been developed historically for this purpose  with debt to equity ratio being the most popular among them Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a more financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity As debt ridden companies are more prone to bankruptcy in times of financial crisis  the very foundation of making safe investment is to avoid high leverage stocks With the market gearing up for second quarter releases  investors tend to get attracted to stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth  overlooking the debt on their balance sheet  Therefore to avoid huge losses we would urge investors to go for stocks with low debt to equity ratio The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion  it is imperative for a sensible investor to choose stocks that have a low debt to equity ratio However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their

136131,357646,ES,Avista  AVA  To Be Acquired By Hydro One For  5 3 Billion,opinion,U S  utility provider  Avista Corp    NYSE AVA   recently announced that it has signed a deal with its Canadian counterpart  Hydro One Ltd  Per the terms  Hydro One will take over Avista for a total cash of  5 3 billion  The merger is expected to close in the second half of 2018  and is still subject to approval from common shareholders and various regulatory authorities According to most of the media sources  Avista s shares took a 17 19  surge soon after the deal surfaced  in after hour trading Details of the MergerThe deal is aimed at creating one of North America s largest regulated utilities  which will serve more than two million customers across the region  The new company will set up headquarters in Toronto On completion of the merger  Avista will keep its existing corporate headquarters in Spokane  WA  The company s management team and employees will also retain their positions  Moreover  the company will go on with its operations in the states of Washington  Oregon  Idaho  Montana and Alaska as a standalone utility Further  Avista s operations will continue to be supervised by its own board of directors  This will ensure the protection of the interests of the Pacific Northwest and the communities it serves Benefits of the MergerAs a result of the merger  Avista s shareholders will receive  53 in cash per common share  which reflects a 24  premium to the share price as of Jul 18  2017  The deal will be accretive to Hydro One s earnings per share in the mid single digits in the first full year of operation From a strategic point of view  this acquisition deal will combine two industry leading regulated utilities with over 230 years of collective operational experience and combined assets worth  25 4 billion  This  in turn  will enable the new entity to provide safer  reliable and high quality energy with a greater scale  diversity and financial flexibility This merger is a notable one from an economic point of view as well  as it will involve no employee layoff from either of the two companies  Moreover  the rates at which customers of both Hydro One and Avista receive their electricity  will remain unchanged Our TakeEnergy services in North America were operated under monopoly conditions throughout most of the 20th century  Following Federal Energy Regulatory Commission s  FERC  Energy Policy Act of 1992  deregulation moved into the electricity market in the region  This  in turn  promoted a healthy competitive business environment  encouraging more energy providers to foray into this market In recent times  the states in the region  particularly those located in the Pacific Northwest  have been experiencing rapid customer and economic growth  To cater to this burgeoning market in here and expand into new lines of regulated utility business outside of its home country  Hydro One chose to take over Avista that has a strong presence in this side of the U S We believe this is in sync with the recent trend of continued interest from Canadian investors in US based utility providers as has been witnessed in the first quarter of 2017  Per a report by PWC  there were two inbound deals in the quarter representing 56  of total value in the North American power and utilities deals Moreover  the combined expertise of these two companies will allow the new entity to deliver cost efficient and more effective utility services to its customers  Further  since the new entity will not levy the cost of this deal on its customers by raising electricity rates  it may also attract more consumers  apart from boosting investors  optimism in the stock s growth expectations Price PerformanceOver the last one year  Avista has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  During this period  the company s shares gained 0 3   compared with the industry s loss of 1 6   This could be because the company s strong financials enable it to execute investor friendly measures at regular intervals  Avista also poses strong competition to its peers like Atlantica Yield PLC   NASDAQ ABY    Eversource Energy   NYSE ES   and Alliant Energy Corp    NYSE LNT   Zacks RankAvista currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see  3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend                   Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy   Last year  it was generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early ,2017-07-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avista-(ava)-to-be-acquired-by-hydro-one-for-$5.3-billion-200202449,200202449
136150,357665,ES,Northeast Utilities May Fall To  37 Per Share By 2013 ,opinion,Here we revisit our pricing model for a company from the Utilities category   Northeast Utilities  NU   a public utility holding company  which provides electric and natural gas energy delivery services In April  we concluded that the price should rise in the second quarter of 2012 to the level of  37 per share  with the relevant standard error of  1 23  The closing monthly price  adjusted for splits and dividends  in June was  38 46  It has increased to  39 3 in October  The updated model indicates that the price has to decrease by approximately  2 in the next few months  Otherwise  the price has to be relatively stable over the next seven months  i e  during the natural forecasting period  One may consider NU as a reliable company for investments but wait before buying at  37   Before presenting the best fit deterministic pricing model for NU we would like to brief on the underlying pricing concept  Our approach consists in decomposition of a share price into a weighted sum of two consumer  or producer  price indices  One may test quantitatively our simple assumption that the growth in some specific CPI related to NU  e g  housekeeping supplies  the BLS name is CUUR0000SEHN and we abbreviate it to HOS  relative to some independent but dynamic reference  e g  food away from home  CUUS0000SEF or SEFV  should be seen in a higher pricing power for the studied company  In essence  our stock price model tries to find one defining CPI and the best reference   In order to find the best pair of CPIs we calculate the RMS residual errors using all permutations from a set of 92 different  not seasonally adjusted  CPIs  In addition we allow for time lag  fixed between 0 and 11 months  between the studied price and both indices  and introduce a linear trend and intercept terms  The best model has the smallest RMS error between July 2003 and October 2012  The complete set includes the headline and core CPI  all major categories from food to other goods and services  and many minor subcategories with long enough history  i e  continuous estimates should be available since 2001    We have borrowed the time series of monthly closing prices of NU from Yahoo com  October 2012 is included  and the CPI estimates through October 2012 are published by the BLS  The best fit models for NU t  in March and October are as follows   NU t     2 57SEVF t 6    0 97HOS t 7    15 18 t 2000    267 79  March 2012 NU t     2 60SEVF t 7    0 98HOS t 8    15 25 t 2000    268 06  October 2012  where NU t  is the NU share price in U S  dollars  t is calendar time  The changes in the model are just minor with the same principal CPIs  very close time lags  and slightly changed coefficients  One can conclude that the data for the past seven months have validated the original model   Figure 1 displays the evolution of both defining indices since 2002  The housekeeping supplies index has a positive influece on the price  i e  the growth in HOS results in a higher NU price  Apparently  the negative slope of SEFV implies that higher food prices reduce the NU return  This is not against common sense   Figure 2 depicts the high and low monthly prices for a NU share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices  The high low prices put natural limits for the variation of the monthly price  The predicted prices are well within the high low share price curves  The model residual error is shown in Figure 3 with the standard error between July 2003 and October 2012 of  1 20  in March  the error was  1 23   All in all  the model is very accurate and all deviations are promptly recovered  i e  the measured curve returns to the predicted one  which leads by seven months  One can foresee the share price behaviour seven months ahead  as shown by solid red line representing a contemporary prediction of the price   Considering Figure 2  one can conclude that the price should fall in the fourth quarter of 2012 to the level of  37 per share  It will likely stay that level in 2013Q1 ,2012-11-18,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northeast-utilities-may-fall-to-$37-per-share-by-2013-144037,144037

136155,357670,ES,What Awaits Utility Stock Eversource  ES  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Diversified energy company  Eversource Energy   NYSE ES   is scheduled to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 7 69   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors to Consider
Eversource s natural gas segment is a key growth driver at the company  The company has shifted around 1 000 customers to natural gas in January and expects customer growth to continue  going ahead  In fact  Eversource expects to add nearly 12 500 to its natural gas customer base in 2016 
On the flip side  the company s service territories experienced historically warm temperatures last December  The warmer than expected winter lowered household expenditure on heating  This can not only offset the gain derived from customer growth  but may continue to dampen revenues in the to be reported quarter 
Nevertheless  Eversource remains focused on upgrading its distribution and utility transmission infrastructure  which will not only enable the company to provide reliable services to its customers but also aid in achieving its earnings growth target of 5 7  in 2016 and beyond  The company projects transmission capital expenditure of  911 million in 2016 
Surprise History

The above chart indicates that Eversource Energy was able to beat earnings estimate in two of the last four quarters  The average positive earnings surprise was 2 86  
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Eversource Energy will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 75   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 77 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 80 cents 
Zacks Rank  Though Eversource Energy s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a few operators in Utility Electric Power space worth considering on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Consolidated Edison  Inc    NYSE ED   has an Earnings ESP of   0 82  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to report earnings on May 5 
Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc    NYSE HE   has an Earnings ESP of   2 70  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to report earnings on May 4
