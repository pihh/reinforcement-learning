189618,411134,KR,Should Beyond Meat Investors Be Worried About Kroger s New Faux Meat Line ,news,"Supermarket chain Kroger  NYSE KR  is the latest company to don a pair of gardening gloves and dig its way into the plant based meat trend 
The new line of patties and ground faux meat extends the grocer s private label  Simple Truth Plant Based  one that it expects will see 50 different products launched this year 
Aside from the fact that Kroger plans to price its store brand of pea based meat alternatives below that of Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND   this new competitor actually poses a bigger risk to the industry leader than might seem possible  because it reveals several uncomfortable truths about Beyond Meat s position 

Planting the seeds of change
Kroger says the new Simple Truth Emerge  Plant Based Fresh Meats will become part of the largest natural and organic brand in the country  which had sales of over  2 3 billion last year  Simple Truth includes some 1 550 natural and organic products  and the new  plant based extension of the brand includes vegan chocolate chip cookie dough  oat milk  sour cream  deli slices  sausage  and other products 
The meat alternative line was first tested in 60 stores over 16 weeks in partnership with the Plant Based Foods Association  and also included deli slices  roasts  seitan  and jackfruit  Depending on who s counting  the protein segment of the plant based market is expected to grow at a compounded 8  annual rate over the next five years 
While a rising tide might lift all boats  there is good reason Beyond Meat investors should still be worried 
There seems to be plenty of opportunity for everyone  Beyond Meat was recently buoyed by the news that McDonald s  NYSE MCD  would expand its test of Beyond Meat s burgers in Canada  and rival Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown told Reuters it would be  stupid  for his company to pursue the chain    because it can t keep up with demand    and  having more big customers right now doesn t do us any good until we scale up production  
Some analysts agree  and caution that McDonald s willingness to only slightly expand the pilot program suggests it also has reservations about Beyond Meat s ability to service all of its restaurants 
While Impossible Foods quickly walked back its CEO s comments the next day  with Brown saying  we would never blow off or disrespect a potential customer   his original point underscores the limitations of these upstarts until they can reach scale 
All hat  no cattle
Competition is growing  In addition to Kroger  protein giant Tyson Foods introduced a plant based meat alternative  as did Nestle  while ConAgra  Hormel  and Kellogg have all also said they have or plan to 
It highlights just how shallow Beyond Meat s competitive moat is  as virtually anyone can enter the space  and Kroger s entry means a good portion of Beyond Meat s business may evaporate if other supermarkets do the same 
Although Beyond Meat s restaurant business is its fastest growing segment  retail has always been the biggest part of Beyond s business  and in the third quarter represented 52  of the total  
While Beyond Meat does have the benefit of name recognition  especially in comparison to the word salad that Kroger chose for its meat alternative  it may find  just as Blue Apron  NYSE APRN  did  that such advantages actually account for little  The meal kit maker saw its first mover advantage evaporate after other companies  especially supermarkets  began introducing their own kits  
There was nothing special about Blue Apron that justified it selling it meal kits at a premium  and now we re likely to see Beyond Meat lose the ability to price its product at a premium too  It only posted its first profit last quarter  now margins may soon come under pressure from rivals undercutting its prices 
Kroger entering the plant based meat market may not seem like a problem at first glance  but there are strong headwinds building up to its business model that we re likely to see Beyond Meat encounter even more turbulence ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph2-2,2057617
189637,411153,KR,Britain s Ocado to open first  mini  robotic warehouse,news,"LONDON  Reuters    British online grocer Ocado  LON OCDO  will open its first  mini  robotic warehouse in Bristol  western England  by early 2021  it said on Thursday  signaling its warehouse technology can be rolled out more quickly and in a bigger range of locations 
While Ocado s retail business holds only a 1 4  share of Britain s grocery market  its technology has powered the group s 8 1 billion pound   10 4 billion  stock market valuation  enabling it to secure partnership deals with supermarket groups around the world  including Kroger  NYSE KR  in the United States 
 This is not about Bristol  but about what it says for its technology biz   said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne 
He said the site going live as quickly as 13 months is half the typical deployment time for a larger warehouse  indicating that warehouses overseas could also be developed at a faster rate 
Identifying Bristol as big enough to sustain what Ocado calls a  customer fulfillment center   CFC  also triples the number of addressable cities for Ocado 
 It is about reducing execution risk  speeding up deployment and extending materially the applicable territories for the international deals   said Monteyne 
Shares in Ocado were up 0 9  at 0903 GMT  extending gains this year to 49  
The Bristol CFC  which is being built in an existing 150 000 square feet warehouse  will be Ocado s sixth and is expected to go live at the end of 2020 or early 2021  It will support around 815 jobs in the local area 
The mini CFC will have the capacity for over 30 000 orders per week compared to about 85 000 orders per week expected from Ocado CFC 5  currently under construction at Purfleet  east of London 
Despite its smaller size  Ocado expects the Bristol site to achieve productivity close to that of its standard facilities 
Ocado and Marks   Spencer completed a 1 5 billion pound joint venture deal in August  creating Ocado Retail and signaling the end of Ocado s supply contract with upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose in September 2020 
Ocado customers in Bristol and the surrounding area will have a wider range of options for delivery  including placing orders for delivery later the same day 
 In the future  mini sized CFCs can complement the standard sized CFCs to build a fulfillment network including in areas not suitable for larger CFCs   Ocado said

189639,411155,KR,3 Reasons Why Kroger  KR  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Kroger  NYSE KR  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this supermarket chain a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Kroger is 3 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 4 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 5  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Kroger has an S TA ratio of 2 87  which means that the company gets  2 87 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 2 26  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Kroger looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 1  this year versus the industry average of 0 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Kroger  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Kroger has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Kroger due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Kroger s Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates  Decline Y o YAfter registering two straight quarters of positive earnings surprises  The Kroger Co  reported a miss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019  The company posted adjusted earnings of 47 cents a share that fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and declined 2 1  from the prior year quarter The company envisions fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings in the band of  2 15  2 25 per share  which indicates an improvement over adjusted earnings of  2 11 per share reported in fiscal 2018  For fiscal 2020  management estimates earnings between  2 30 and  2 40 per share Total sales of  27 974 million came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  28 067 million  This was the second straight quarter when sales missed the consensus mark  However  the metric improved marginally by 0 5  from the prior year quarter  Excluding fuel and dispositions  top line improved 2 7  from the year ago period  The company s digital sales surged 21   while identical sales  excluding fuel  grew 2 5  Kroger expects underlying identical sales growth in the final quarter to be equivalent to third quarter  Management forecast identical sales growth of 2 2 25  for fiscal 2019  It envisions identical sales  excluding fuel  to be above 2 25  in fiscal 2020 We note that gross margin increased 30 basis points to 22 1   FIFO gross margin  excluding fuel  shrunk 24 basis points from the year ago period  mainly due to industry wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy  Adjusted FIFO operating profit fell 1 7  to  653 million  Kroger anticipates adjusted operating profit in the band of  2 9  3 billion and  3  3 1 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2020  respectively Strategic EndeavorsThe grocery industry has been undergoing a fundamental change  with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping  Kroger has taken stock of the situation and is in the process of giving itself a complete makeover The company s  Restock Kroger  program involving investments in omnichannel platform  identifying margin rich alternative profit streams  merchandise optimization  and lowering of expenses has been gaining traction  The company is expanding store base  introducing new items  digital coupons  and order online  pick up in store initiative Management informed that  Our Brands  sales grew 3 4   The company also introduced 231 new Our Brands items  Pickup or Delivery reached 96  of Kroger households  expanded to 1 915 Pickup locations and 2 326 Delivery locations   Management is also targeting  margin rich alternative profit streams  which are likely to contribute an estimated incremental  100 million in operating profit this fiscal year versus the prior  Alternative profit streams are anticipated to contribute an incremental  125  150 million in operating profit in fiscal 2020 Other Financial AspectsKroger ended the quarter with cash of  417 million  total debt of  13 644 million  and shareowners  equity of  8 728 million  Total debt decreased  1 374 million from the prior year period  The company lowered its debt burden by  1 5 billion over the prior four quarters  Management anticipates capital expenditures of  3  3 2 billion in fiscal 2019 and between  3 2  3 4 billion in fiscal 2020  The company forecast free cash flow generation of  1 6  1 8 billion in fiscal 2020  The company expects to make share repurchases of  500  1 000 million in fiscal 2020

189641,411157,KR,Should Value Investors Consider Kroger Co   KR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Kroger Co    NYSE KR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Kroger Co  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 55  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 29  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Kroger Co  s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 14 05  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 85  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Kroger Co  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 19  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Kroger Co  s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Kroger Co  has a P S ratio of about 0 19  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 51 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Kroger Co  currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes KR a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Kroger Co  is just 2 49  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 64  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 46  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 6 98  Clearly  KR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Kroger Co  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives KR a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and two lower  while the full year estimate witnessed three upward and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has not witnessed any earnings movement in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Kroger Co  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineKroger Co  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 24  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the

189681,411197,KR,Where s the fake beef  Not at Kraft Heinz  investors worry,news,"By Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale
CHICAGO  Reuters    Investors are chewing out Kraft Heinz Co  O KHC  for failing to lay out a full strategy for how it plans to compete in the roughly  3 billion a year plant based protein market 
At the Kraft Heinz annual meeting to be held in Pittsburgh on Thursday  shareholders will vote on a proposal asking the company to reveal its long term strategy for imitation meat and alternative proteins 
Products by rivals  Beyond Meat Inc   O BYND  and Impossible Foods have become the hottest food trend in recent years  gaining popularity among mainstream consumers looking to cut back on meat consumption 
 It s a fast growing market and they ve been really silent with investors on how they plan to tackle that   said Kyle Kempf  a spokesman for Green Century Funds  which proposed the proxy vote and owns a more than  460 000 stake in Kraft Heinz 
Kraft Heinz has been ranked one of the least proactive major food makers in the plant based protein market  according to FAIRR  a major investor coalition that includes several Kraft Heinz shareholders  The company s main meat alternative brand  40 year old BOCA Burger  has lost market share since 2013 
 Any company ranking at the bottom clearly has some catching up to do   said Peter van der Werf  head of responsible investment management at Robeco  which owns an  9 6 million stake in Kraft Heinz 
Robeco and another Kraft Heinz investor  NN Investment Partners  told Reuters they were inclined to support the investor demand that Kraft Heinz cough up more specifics about its alternative protein strategy  Neither company would disclose whether they will vote for the proposal  which Kraft Heinz s board of directors has recommended rejecting 
Kraft Heinz  which took a  15 4 billion writedown this year on its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands  has been criticized for spending too little on innovation and marketing after years of cost cuts under managers from 3G Capital  Kraft Heinz s No  2 shareholder  Since the writedown  the company s shares have fallen about 40  
BOCA LOSES SIZZLE
BOCA Burger  credited by some as the original U S  veggie burger for the masses  was bought by the then Kraft Foods in 2000  One problem for the aging BOCA Burger  however  is that the current alternative meat craze is actually being driven not by vegetarians  but by so called flexitarians   meat eaters who occasionally buy alternative protein products  To appeal to these shoppers  Beyond Meat and other upstarts are convincing grocers to stock their products next to fresh looking animal burgers in chilled meat cases 
BOCA Burgers  by contrast  are frozen and sit in refrigerators with vegetarian and vegan products  where meat eaters may not think to look 
 Kroger Co   N KR   one of the first grocers to sell Beyond Meat patties in meat cases  said on Tuesday it was testing a plant based protein section in the meat departments of 60 stores to gauge shopper behavior 
BOCA Burger s share of the U S  plant based burger market shrank to 3 8  last year  compared with 7 3  in 2013  according to Euromonitor 
Kraft Heinz declined to provide details on its plans for plant based proteins or comment on the forthcoming shareholder vote  In a filing ahead of the meeting  Kraft Heinz said several named executives had forfeited their bonuses for 2018 due to the company s performance  Chief Executive Officer Miguel Patricio  who took the helm in July  said last month that the company needed to better understand consumers and was  far behind the plant based market  
Spokeswoman Lynne Galia said Kraft Heinz had increased BOCA sales over the past year  driven by changes to the taste  texture and packaging of its products   We are committed to ensuring our BOCA products maintain meaningful competitive claims versus meat products  as well as competitive claims in the category as it evolves   Galia said 
But BOCA s new boxes lack the  plant based  buzzword  and tout an  All American Veggie Burger  at a time when rivals lure meat eaters by avoiding terms like  vegan  or  vegetarian  
Faryda Lindeman  a senior responsible investment specialist at NN Investment Partners  said big companies including Kraft Heinz that had fallen behind in the plant based market were likely set in their ways and did not want to invest in new risks  NN Investment holds a  9 4 million stake in Kraft Heinz 
 The only thing they can do is to buy other companies of course  they have a lot of cash   Lindeman said  3G Capital is known for scoring big M A deals to drive growth  but new Kraft Heinz CEO Patricio said when his appointment was announced in April that his focus  for now  would be on expanding existing brands ",2019-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wheres-the-fake-beef-not-at-kraft-heinz-investors-worry-1976401,1976401
189704,411220,KR,Beyond Meat beats revenue estimates  raises forecast as demand sizzles,news,By Tina Bellon and Uday Sampath Kumar  Reuters    Beyond Meat Inc s  O BYND  shares tumbled on Monday on plans for another stock offering just three months after its IPO while demand for its plant based burgers and sausages prompted an increase in its full year sales forecast   Trading was volatile and shares fell more than 12  after hours on news of a 3 25 million share offering that includes 3 million shares from selling stockholders  Proceeds are earmarked to raise funds to expand its manufacturing facilities that are being stretched by booming demand for its meat alternatives  Executives on a call with analysts declined to comment on the offering   Beyond Meat s shares have surged over 780  since the IPO in May as the company s meat alternatives entered the menus of restaurants such as Carl s Jr and on shelves of grocers including  Kroger Co   N KR   Plant based meat alternatives have seen booming interest from consumers and restaurants  supporting startups like Beyond Meat and its competitor Impossible Foods  and even sparking interest from veteran meat companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  and Perdue Foods  which now offer meat protein products mixed with plants   For another growth stock  the top line beat and raises would be enough to see a post market rally  but there are a lot of Beyond Meat investors out there looking for any excuse to sell a stock that has rocketed so much since its IPO   said Kamal Khan  analyst at financial markets platform Investing com  Beyond Meat products are now sold at more than 53 000 retailers and restaurants worldwide  with demand boosted by the grilling season underway  Beyond Meat s CEO Ethan Brown said on Monday  At supermarket chain Morton Williams  NYSE WMB   which owns 16 locations across New York City  some customers are buying Beyond Meat burger patties and sausages by the case  according to Victor Colello  the chain s director of meat and fish   Beyond Meat is really flying off the shelves  My business with it has almost doubled and we re sold out at times   Colello said  The latest version of the burgers is made from peas  brown rice  sunflower seeds and mung beans  Net revenue rose nearly four fold to  67 3 million in the three months ended June 29  above Wall Street s estimate of  52 71 million  according to Refinitiv IBES data  The company said it expects net revenue to rise over 170  to  240 million in 2019  up from the prior  210 million it had forecast just last month  The El Segundo  California based company reported a net loss of  9 4 million  or a loss 24 cents per share  compared with a loss of  7 4 million  or a loss of  1 22 per share in the year ago period  NO SIGN OF SLOWING Karen Formanski  an analyst at Mintel who authored a consumer research report on plant based protein  said there were no signs of the meat alternatives market slowing  with 38  of U S  consumers trying to add more plant based protein to their diet   But with growing competition  criticism over processed food and clean eating getting more important  companies will have to adapt and offer more variety than just burgers  Formanski said   Brown on Monday rejected growing criticism over Beyond Meat s products being overly processed and unhealthy  saying it was not a question of whether they were processed but how  The company seeks to further diversify its protein sources without relying on genetic modification  Brown said    There are an almost endless amount of crops you can pull from   and it is really important that Beyond is leading the effort of bringing new proteins into the market   Brown said  The CEO said he was confident his company could take on competition from Impossible Foods  which relies on genetically modified soy seeds to produce its burger patties  because of consumers hesitancy surrounding those technologies  Impossible Foods initially planned to roll out to retail stores this fall  but has continuously pushed back plans due to supply shortages  Analysts during Monday s call pressed Beyond Meat executives for details on looming supply chain bottlenecks as demand continues to surge   Brown said the company would expand its in house manufacturing facilities in Missouri  buy new equipment  while continuing to outsource the packaging of its products by adding new partners    That s not to say we won t have some periodic disruptions that may create temporary shortages   the CEO said  Brown said the company currently had a sufficient and continued supply of the protein it needs for its burgers  also thanks to the entry of larger players  including DuPont  N DD   into the pea protein market  Even so  the company has skeptics  Some 46  of the company s publicly traded shares are shorted  according to research group S3  Those investors  owning shares worth  1 1 billion  are betting on the company to miss its targets and the share

189746,411262,KR,Kroger  KR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Kroger  NYSE KR  reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on September 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This supermarket chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 4  
Revenues are expected to be  28 42 billion  up 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kroger 
For Kroger  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kroger will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kroger would post earnings of  0 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 72  delivering a surprise of  1 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kroger doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-09-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kroger-kr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200461932,200461932

189829,411345,KR,U S  Will Fail to Release Key Economic Report at Critical Moment,news," Bloomberg     The U S  growth outlook hangs more than ever on American consumers  resilience amid stock market swoons and trade war tensions  but key data on their spending    the biggest part of the economy    will be missing due to the government shutdown 
Was it a gangbusters Christmas shopping season as forecasts and anecdotal evidence suggested  Were consumers making big discretionary purchases in addition to essential spending as they entered 2019  even as some surveys showed confidence was waning  The answers will have to wait  as the December retail sales report won t be released as scheduled Wednesday while the Commerce Department remains closed  Failure to reopen soon also would delay last month s personal income and spending data  due by Jan  31 
Together  those reports constitute the most widely watched measures of household consumption  which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy  The disruptions come at a challenging time  plunging regional gauges of U S  manufacturing and business surveys indicate a slowdown in growth  and some big name retailers have issued warnings about mixed holiday results 
While the solid job market remains a bulwark and consumers are in good shape  more    not less    information is needed to assess if the economy faces bigger than anticipated risks  one reason investors are nervous and Federal Reserve officials have emphasized patience in raising borrowing costs 
 Job growth  income growth and low inflation are all positive for consumer spending   so having data to confirm would be helpful  said Scott Brown  chief economist at Raymond James Financial Inc   It could help soothe the market s fears to some extent  
With no end in sight for the shutdown  a burgeoning concern is that data may not just be delayed  they may also not get collected as normal  Brown said 
What U S  Government Shutdown Means for Economic Data  QuickTake
For now  investors and analysts will have to rely on a patchwork of data  The Johnson Redbook report showed December sales rose from a year earlier  though it tracks a limited sample of results  The Retail Economist Goldman Sachs weekly chain store sales figures are another source  Other groups provide clues on individual sectors  such as the National Restaurant Association s monthly index 
Without the government s retail report  it s also tough to accurately gauge how consumers are spending on big ticket items such as cars  Meanwhile  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV s Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said he s  concerned  about the shutdown s impact on the company s efforts to introduce crucial new heavy duty pickups 
The delay in government issued economic releases  introduces a greater degree of uncertainty  which typically isn t good   said Jim Paulsen  chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management LLC    It does create some real risk of misinterpretation  as people try to compensate with other  sometimes partial  sources of information  like a retail CEO s comments 
The nuances in signals from the consumer were evident this week in executive comments from Kroger  NYSE KR  Co   America s biggest supermarket chain 
 They feel incredibly good about the economy but very nervous about where things are headed   Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen said Sunday in an onstage interview at the National Retail Federation s annual trade show in New York 
Credit card results from companies including Visa  NYSE V  and MasterCard would help fill some of the void  And the Fed s next Beige Book release on Wednesday may also provide anecdotal details on spending and other parts of the economy  That s why some investors are taking the data disruptions in stride 
 In a world of big data  there are so many other ways to get a view of the consumer than the monthly numbers from the Commerce Department   said David Sowerby  portfolio manager at the investment firm Ancora  which manages  6 9 billion 
No Instruments
Still  companies depend on broader economic data to make investment decisions  and without it they re  to a degree  flying without any instruments   according to NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz 
The Commerce Department s monthly data are crucial to get a bigger picture because about 90 percent of retail sales come from small businesses  he said  Recently  several large publicly traded retailers such as Macy s Inc  and Kohl s Corp  provided discouraging updates 
 It was disappointing news  but I don t know how pervasive that performance was   Kleinhenz said 
The trade association itself is somewhat in the dark until the government releases the data  Without official numbers   we can t provide our final report this week either  on holiday spending  according to NRF spokeswoman Ana Serafin Smith ",2019-01-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-will-fail-to-release-key-economic-report-at-critical-moment-1747008,1747008

189832,411348,KR,Kroger  KR  Reports Next Week  What To Expect,opinion,"The market expects Kroger  NYSE KR  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This supermarket chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  36 78 billion  down 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 99  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kroger 
For Kroger  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 11  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kroger will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kroger would post earnings of  0 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 48  delivering a surprise of  5 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kroger doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kroger-kr-reports-next-week-what-to-expect-200431364,200431364
189833,411349,KR,Kroger  KR  Beats Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Kroger  NYSE KR  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 72 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 71 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 73 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 41   A quarter ago  it was expected that this supermarket chain would post earnings of  0 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 48  delivering a surprise of  5 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Kroger  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Supermarkets industry  posted revenues of  37 25 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 05   This compares to year ago revenues of  37 53 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Kroger shares have lost about 14  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 7  
What s Next for Kroger 
While Kroger has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Kroger was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 43 on  28 42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 19 on  122 46 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

1  ADP Employment  Services PMI Highlight Indicators
The economic calendar is packed tomorrow as most of the Wednesday releases were delayed for the national day of mourning for former President George H W  Bush 
ADP s measure of private nonfarm employment  closely watched ahead of Friday s official labor report  will be released at 8 15 AM ET  13 15 GMT   Private payrolls are expected to have grown by 195 000 in November  according to economists 
At 8 30 AM ET the weekly measure of initial jobless claims arrives  with economists predicting a drop to 226 000 for the latest period 
October factory orders come in at 10 00 AM ET  with a 1 9  drop predicted 
At the same time  the ISM will release its measure of services activity in the economy for November will be released 
On average  economists expect that the ISM non manufacturing PMI fell slightly to 59 2 last month 
2  OPEC Meeting Begins
The oil market will be particularly active as OPEC gets its meeting in Vienna underway 
Traders have been grappling with mixed signals from Saudi Arabia about whether there will be a production cut as the kingdom does not want to bear the brunt of any supply contraction by itself and also wants to avoid irking President Donald Trump 
Russia  which is expected to participate in any cut  has also been cagey 
In addition  traders will have the latest weekly oil inventories data   pushed forward a day   to digest at 11 00 AM ET  16 00 GMT  
The big rise in U S  crude stockpiles is a major reason why oil prices tumbled sharply last month

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Beyond Meat Inc    NASDAQ BYND    Restaurant Brands International Inc    NYSE QSR    McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   and The Kroger Co    NYSE KR   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Meatless Burgers Selling Like Hotcakes  Fad or Budding Trend With increasing health awareness and public campaigns regarding the adverse effects of processed red meat  consumers are gradually shunning meat based products for meatless alternatives  The silent yet pronounced shift in dietary preferences has brought to the fore evolving business models from quick service restaurants and startup firms as demand has far outstripped the supply As items like meatless burgers are selling like hotcakes  it appears that the trend is here to stay and a vegan revolution is likely to sweep the culinary tastes of the Americans What s Driving the Trend Alarming rise in average global temperatures due to adverse climate change has hampered the eco diversity of several places  risking human wellbeing  Various studies have revealed that beef generates about 41  of livestock greenhouse gas emissions   the largest among livestock  This has led to mass awareness campaigns by environmental activists to preserve natural resources  improve human health and animal welfare by reducing red meat consumption  In 2015  the World Health Organization also pitched in and linked the consumption of processed meat to cancer  branding red meat as a likely carcinogen This encouraged firms like Beyond Meat Inc  and start ups like Impossible Foods to come up with plant based protein products that are similar to the taste and appearance of meat  The innovative products instantly caught the fancy of consumers with a distinct appeal to their taste buds  and have witnessed exponential growth in the past couple of years Growing Market PenetrationImpossible Foods initially partnered with some restaurants to serve the meatless  plant based burger patty and gradually increased the tally to 7 000 as its products grew immensely popular  In order to cater to the huge demand  the firm increased its production facility with added employee base and even raised  300 million through celebrity funding from Jay Z  Katy Perry  Serena Williams  NYSE WMB  among others to fuel its growth engine  Impossible Foods has so far generated  750 million to run its business and aims to further extend its operations to bridge the demand supply imbalance Burger King  the second largest burger chain in the United State owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc   is the latest to partner with this start up  when it announced that it will offer a vegetarian version of its flagship sandwich using a patty from Impossible Foods  Named the Impossible Whopper  this delicacy will be offered in Burger King s 7 300 joints across the country  This is likely to further amplify the demand and put the industry on fast track to growth  On its part  Burger King aims to increase footfall to its restaurants by offering the meatless version of its signature burger    McDonald s Corp  also seems to be eager to join the fray as it started selling a meatless version of its burger in its German restaurants last month  Known as the Big Vegan TS  the company is likely to analyze the response to this item before taking a final call to introduce it in the United States Road AheadWith increased publicity  supermarkets like The Kroger Co  are mulling to start selling these items through their retail stores this year  That the culinary trend is here to stay is further corroborated by Beyond Meat  a leading competitor of Impossible Foods  which went public last month with  25 IPO price and is currently trading at  79 68 as of May 14  2019  Beyond Meat has reportedly improved its supply chain and even ramped up production to match the increased demand Dewey Warner  a research analyst at Euromonitor International  rightly summarized   There s a lot of flash in the pan  fast growing things in the food industry  But growth in the plant based meat alternative space is accelerating  indicating that this is more than just a fad  This may have some staying power  Will you retire a millionaire

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Kroger  NYSE KR  in Focus
Headquartered in Cincinnati  Kroger  KR  is a Retail Wholesale stock that has seen a price change of  6 65  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 14 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 18   In comparison  the Retail   Supermarkets industry s yield is 2 23   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 89  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 56 is up 5 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Kroger has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 71   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Kroger s current payout ratio is 27   This means it paid out 27  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend

190153,411669,KR,Wall St  drops amid worries over North Korea test  rate outlook,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  stocks dropped on Friday  giving the S P 500 its worst day since June as investor nervousness increased following a nuclear test by North Korea and Federal Reserve officials  comments lifted rate hike bets 
The CBOE Volatility index  VIX  closed at its highest level since late June  while the S P 500 index closed below its 50 day moving average for the first time also in about two months  a sign that further weakness may be ahead 
The equity selloff also came as the U S  Treasury yield curve continues to steepen  Long dated yields reached more than two month highs  after reports suggested Japan is considering measures to cut short  to medium term yields  while lifting those of long term bonds 
Traditionally  September tends to be a month of lower returns for stocks  and traders said this year could be no exception given the abundance of uncertainties including the rate outlook and November s U S  election 
 With worries about growth and what the Fed is going to do about rate hikes    It could be the start of a little bit of a pullback   especially after recent record high combined with low volatility  said Giri Cherukuri  head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle  Illinois 
North Korea conducted its fifth and biggest nuclear test on Friday and said it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile  drawing condemnation from the United States as well as China  Pyongyang s main ally 
Further pressure on the U S  equity market came after Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren  a historically dovish policymaker  said the U S  central bank faced increasing risks if it waited too much longer to raise interest rates 
He said a gradual monetary policy tightening was likely appropriate  although he added the Fed was unlikely to raise rates too rapidly 
The Dow Jones industrial average  DJI  was down 394 46 points  or 2 13 percent  to 18 085 45  while the S P 500  SPX  lost 53 49 points  or 2 45 percent  to 2 127 81  This was the S P s biggest one day percentage decline since June 24  the day after Britain s vote to leave the European Union 
The Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  dropped 133 58 points  or 2 54 percent  to 5 125 91 
Stocks also fell for the week  with the Dow down 2 2 percent  its biggest weekly percentage drop since the first week of 2016 
U S  stocks have been subdued for two months  with the benchmark S P 500 index failing to register a move of more than 1 percent on a closing basis in either direction since July 8 
The Fed holds its two day policy meeting on Sept  20 21  The perceived chances of a September rate hike climbed to 24 percent in the wake of the Fed comments  according to CME s FedWatch tool  from 18 percent the previous day 
 There are lots of reasons for people to get nervous  particularly with the market at all time highs  There s enough negative to tip things over to people taking some profits there   said Eric Kuby  chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp  in Chicago 
Kroger s  N KR  was the latest grocer to give a disappointing outlook  though its shares pared losses late in the session to end up 0 6 percent  Outlooks from Sprouts Farmers Market Inc  O SFM  and SuperValu Inc  N SVU  earlier this week also disappointed investors 
Utilities  SPLRCU  were down 3 8 percent and telecoms  SPLRCL  down more than 3 4 percent  the worst performing of the 10 major S P sectors  The sectors have been strong performers on the year as investors have used their high dividends as a bond proxy

190282,411798,KR,This Is Why Kroger  KR  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Kroger  NYSE KR  in Focus
Based in Cincinnati  Kroger  KR  is in the Retail Wholesale sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of  10 29   The supermarket chain is paying out a dividend of  0 14 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 27  compared to the Retail   Supermarkets industry s yield of 2 18  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 96  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 56 is up 5 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Kroger has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 71   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Kroger s payout ratio is 27   which means it paid out 27  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
KR is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  2 25 per share  with earnings expected to increase 6 64  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  KR is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-kroger-kr-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200396830,200396830
190291,411807,KR,Should Value Investors Pick Kroger Co   KR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Kroger Co    NYSE KR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Kroger Co  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Kroger Co  s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 15 6  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Kroger Co  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Kroger Co  s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Kroger Co  has a P S ratio of about 0 2  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Kroger Co  currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes KR a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 9  which is slightly better than the industry average of 9 4  Clearly  KR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Kroger Co  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives KR a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the

190333,411849,KR,Kroger  KR  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Kroger  NYSE KR  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This supermarket chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  27 58 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 1  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kroger 
For Kroger  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 58  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Kroger will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kroger would post earnings of  0 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 41  delivering a surprise of  7 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kroger appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kroger-kr-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200363625,200363625
190334,411850,KR,Will Kroger  KR  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Kroger  NYSE KR   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Supermarkets industry 
This supermarket chain has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11 88  
For the last reported quarter  Kroger came out with earnings of  0 41 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 38 per share  representing a surprise of 7 89   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 63 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 73 per share  delivering a surprise of 15 87  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Kroger  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Kroger currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 50   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on December 6  2018 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-kroger-kr-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200364058,200364058

these countries Further  referring to Australia as United States   long term trading partner   Trump stated that tariffs might be modified for the country along with a few others  Moreover  such tariffs have been imposed under a law which clearly allows any  action  in favor of U S  national security  Officials from the Trump administration have stated that both steel and aluminum are important for the defense industry of the United States European Union s Retaliation to Trump s TariffsIn a not so surprising move on Wednesday  EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr m announced at a press conference that EU was  discussing  about which U S  products it would impose tariffs on if Trump levies hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Ultimately  the EU officially announced a three way plan of action to hit back against the latest tariff plan  First  the EU plans to move a case against the United States to the WTO  in cooperation with other trading members of the bloc  This would be done in order to protect industries within the EU from Trump s tariffs  Further  Malmstr m stated that EU being an ally of the US in NATO forces cannot pose a national threat to America   which is principles on which the new tariff plan is based on Secondly  the bloc would use WTO allowed measures to fight tariffs it believes are unjust  Malmstr m made it very clear that any action would be taken in compliance with the rules and regulations established by the WTO and also stated that a trade war would not benefit any country Finally  the EU also plans to impose duties and tariffs on goods imported from the United States  The body has come up with a provisional list of products that would be met with hefty tariffs once imported into the EU  If imposed  such tariffs would amount to

190466,411982,KR,Disasters Dent Markets As Investors Brace For Irma,opinion," True heroism is remarkably sober  very undramatic  It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost  but the urge to serve others at whatever cost    Arthur Ashe
When most kids are young  they probably imagine themselves in a profession which draws plenty of attention  These days  as has been the case for many years  the majority of the publicity for work is drawn to athletes  musicians  actors  and if ever there was a group which clearly deserved no attention  our hard working politicians  In any event  with two once in a century storms striking Texas and Florida in the brief time span of two weeks  and maybe one more right behind them   there are plenty of people who are looking at an extended period of real difficulty  In these tough circumstances  the genuine heroes emerge with their hard work  compassion  and meaningful contributions helping society rebuild  They are our parents  teachers  nurses  librarians  doctors  lawyers  accountants  engineers  construction workers  police officers  fire fighters  sanitation  consultants  and of course  the public service employees in the multiple areas of government  city  state  federal   There is no television interview  cheering fans  red carpet treatment  or glamour anywhere to be found in these roles  However  as one matures and evolves  you come to recognize what is important and substantive  and conversely  what is shallow and meaningless 
In the investment world  the glamour usually goes to the star hedge fund or mutual fund manager who is shooting the lights out with great performance during the last six months or year  Meanwhile  all across the professional  there are unsung advisers and planners who find out about the goals and dreams of their clients and work hard to make them happen in a responsible way  It involves plenty of reading  analysis  and psychological strength  especially when markets  portfolios  or positions take a tumble  Over the years  quietly beating the market by one  two  or three percent  maybe more  can add up to an incredible amount of extra money for those fortunate to have capital placed with these excellent professionals  Like their fellow contributors in many unsung roles  yes  the humble financial person is also a hero 
In this light  I might add one of the most important skills an investor can learn  which many advisors excel at  is learning not to panic when things go against you  Yes  finding a good company at a fair price is critical in equity investing  but so is holding good companies when they may falter and not cutting them loose if they have a bad quarter  Often times  the best investment you can make is to reinvest capital into an existing position you are familiar with when it struggles  which happens to nearly every business  As an example  a few years ago a powerhouse holding had results which were OK  but the industry was in a poor place and the position sold off a little bit  A few years later  it has recovered nicely  and adding to it has worked out well  so far   A different course of action  like selling and taking a loss  would leave you with a completely different result  Again  no glamour involved  just making good decisions  which is really what investing is based on 
In the markets this week  on the macro economic front  Mario Draghi left its economic stimulus program unchanged but indicated that in October  it will cut back its bond buying binge  You might have noticed the lingering weakness in our dollar  especially against the now strong euro  If you haven t  fear not  you will hear about it more during earnings season  which will be upon us in a month or so  On the corporate front  a few final reports trickled in from computer giant HP  NYSE HPQ   not bad   and supermarket behemoth Kroger  NYSE KR   which was fine until they withdrew guidance for next year because of emerging competition  I wonder what company that could be  Whole Paycheck maybe  not now  that s for sure   Restoration Hardware  NYSE RH   long under attack by the shorts because of an aggressive buyback  blew out numbers and drew blood  Shorting works  until it doesn t  so don t think that is always the answer either  In the small cap world  DavidsTea  NASDAQ DTEA  and Zumiez  NASDAQ ZUMZ  also showed nice results so maybe retail is looking a bit better 
Finally  in the shallow world of politics  it turns out our savior in dealing with the nut ball from North Korea might be none other than our countries own nut job  No  it is not Donald  who has certainly imprinted our Presidential office with his own distinct seal  Our definition of crazy diplomat would be the tattooed one  the honorary Dennis Rodman  who offered his services in guiding the North Korean wacko down from the nuclear brink  In thinking about it  Donald could send the threesome of those he fired  Rodman  Mooch  and James Comey as a team to deal with North Korea  It certainly would get plenty of attention  which is what the trio specialized in  naturally  Of course  none of these people are genuine heroes  as you know who that distinction is reserved for  T Disclosure  Y H   C Investments  Yale Bock  and the family of Yale Bock own positions in securities mentioned in the blog post  Investing in stocks can lead to the complete loss of your capital  As always  on any company mentioned here  past performance is not a guarantee of future returns  Investing involves risk of losses on invested capital  One should research any investment and make sure it is suitable with your objectives  risk tolerance  risk profile liquidity considerations  tax situation  and anything else pertinent to your financial situation  Also  the CFA credential in no way implies investment returns will be superior for any charter holder ",2017-09-10,Yale Bock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/disasters-dent-markets-as-investors-brace-for-irma-200212343,200212343

Kroger stock is underperforming the market  It s beaten down  but it reports earnings soon  So is it a good time to buy  To answer this question  we ve turned to the Investment U Stock Grader  Our Research Team built this system to diagnose the financial health of a company 
Our system looks at six key metrics   
  Earnings per Share   EPS  Growth  Kroger reported a recent EPS growth rate of  54 17   That s below the food and staples retailing industry average of 37 84   That s not a good sign  We like to see companies that have higher earnings growth 
  Price to Earnings   P E   The average price to earnings ratio of the food and staples retailing industry is 29 96  And Kroger s ratio comes in at 12 4  It s trading at a better value than many of its competitors 
  Debt to Equity   The debt to equity ratio for Kroger stock is 219 14   That s above the food and staples retailing industry average of 70 82   That s not a good sign  Kroger s debt levels should be lower 
  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   Kroger s FCF has been lower than that of its competitors over the last year  That s not good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors 
  Profit Margins   The profit margin of Kroger comes in at 0 84  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this margin above that of its competitors  Kroger s profit margin is below the food and staples retailing average of 2 89   So that s a negative indicator for investors 
  Return on Equity   Return on equity tells us how much profit a company produces with the money shareholders invest  The ROE for Kroger is 25 23   and that s above its industry average ROE of 16 55  
Kroger stock passes two of our six key metrics today  That s why our Investment U Stock Grader rates it as a Hold With Caution ",2017-08-31,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-buy-kroger-stock-before-earnings-200210610,200210610

190558,412074,KR,2 Grocery Stocks To Buy  1 To Avoid,opinion,"The past few years for grocery stocks have not been kind to investors  Many of the companies that are in this industry have fallen on hard times  And their bleak outlooks on future earnings don t help them get back in favor of investors 
But with so many grocery stocks struggling  there have to be some stocks in this sector worth investing in  right  There are  Unfortunately the list is fairly short  I ll walk you through 2 grocery stocks to put on your radar or consider buying now  I will also highlight one popular grocer to avoid for the foreseeable future as they have hit some troubling times 
2 Grocery Stocks To Buy
 1  Sprouts Farmers Market  NASDAQ SFM 
Sprouts Farmers Market is not a household name  When it comes to investing  this can be a good thing since many investors are oblivious to it  Sadly this is not entirely the case with Sprouts  Many investors have jumped on this stock already  realizing how good of a company it is  But fear not  there is still time for you to jump in too and enjoy the ride 
For 2017  earnings per share for the company are expected to increase by 3 4  and analysts expect the stock to increase in value by 25  for the year 
And while buyouts should not be the only reason to buy a stock  there are rumors of Sprouts being bought by Albertsons 
 2  Kroger  NYSE KR 
If you just glance at the earnings of Kroger  you might think that this grocery stock isn t worth a second look  But you would be wrong  While in the short term Kroger faces some challenges  it has a lot going for it 
Even as earnings have fallen  same store sales have held up  In fact  they remained positive for 52 consecutive quarters until this most recent quarter  In addition to this  Kroger is growing its online side of the business  allowing people to grocery shop from home  They are also growing their private label foods to compete with lower priced alternatives 
Still the company has to face up to the growing community of discount grocers  Since the recession in 2008  discount grocery stores have seen tremendous sales growth and as a result  are adding new locations  This leads more customers to flow away from stores like Kroger s and to these low priced competitors 
But even with the added competition  Kroger is a stock to buy  They are the best positioned grocer out there to stand up against lower priced competitors  To help offset the potential decline  they are focusing on more lower priced organic foods  hoping to entice shoppers from more expensive grocers like Whole Foods 
While it won t be smooth sailing in the near term for Kroger  the stock should hold up well 
Grocery Stock To Avoid
 1  Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM 
As an organic grocery store  Whole Foods was all the rage  In many cases  they were the only game in town when it came to healthy  organic foods  But then other grocers started to take pages from Whole Foods playbook  Sadly for Whole Foods  the other grocery stores are playing a better game 
The other stores are offering the same products for much less  undercutting Whole Foods  As a result  the stock has tumbled  along with earnings  Comparable same store sales have been declining since 2015 
The major problem is how Whole Foods runs its business  Most other grocery stores work on a national network whereas Whole Foods works on a regional network  This allows them to offer popular local items  While this is great for shoppers  it is also a negative  By not having a cohesive network means it costs more to run the business 
So until Whole Foods can figure this out  the stock is not one to buy  That is unless of course you have time and just want to buy in now and patiently wait  hoping for a successful turnaround 
Final Thoughts
In all  grocery stocks are not a fun place to be as an investor  But if you can weed your way through the bad options out there  you can find a few diamonds in the rough  And when you do  make sure you hold on for the ride they are going to offer you

Industry  Consumer Staples  part 3

Link  

Despite a modest economic recovery and improvement in U S  consumer confidence  persistent uncertainty about the global backdrop could limit the staple stocks  upside potential 

A host of factors have been plaguing the global economy  with uncertainty related to the Fed rate hike being one of them  Although the possibility of a rate hike in September is now behind us  it has fueled expectations of an interest rate hike by the U S  Federal Reserve in December 

Apart from this  the tightening U S  Presidential election is also adding to market uncertainty  Markets don t like uncertainty and the prospects of a close election could potentially weigh on stocks  all stocks  over the coming weeks 

In addition  headwinds like unfavorable currency  food deflation  potential price wars  a competitive environment  slowdown in international markets  political turmoil in Russia  sluggishness in Japan and an unfavorable economic environment in Europe are hindering growth  In Europe  the economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit  Britain s exit from the European Union  

Amid global worries  we note that consumer spending pattern is changing and they are not willing to splurge despite benefiting from still lower fuel prices and higher wages  While some are busy boosting their savings  others are burdened with higher health care costs 

Hence  investors should carefully select stocks for their portfolio as certain headwinds are likely to prevail in the coming months

An oversupply in some types of food   particularly meat  poultry and dairy   has dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions  Cheaper groceries have also hurt the restaurant business  with more people opting to save money and eat at home 

The natural supply cycle in beef  a massive rebound in poultry and egg production following last year s Avian flu that overshot demand and the stronger dollar along with general weaker demand for dairy in Asia led to the oversupply and resultant drop in commodity prices 

Analysts believe the price wars between companies will erode profits  leading to declining margins in the near term 

Slowdown in Emerging Markets

The majority of the global population lives in emerging economies  Due to a slowdown in income and consumption growth  affordability is low  Though there remains huge opportunity for sales growth in these markets  currently the state of affairs remains volatile 

Apart from China  which is struggling since the past few quarters  developing countries like Brazil and Mexico are facing economic slowdown  The Middle East  Russia and Ukraine are witnessing continued political and civil unrest resulting in challenging operating conditions  Some developed markets are also facing weakness due to sluggish consumer demand

190633,412149,KR,Let s Go Krogering For Value And Profit  ,opinion,"Introduction
In today s frothy stock market  finding value in dividend growth stocks is hard to do  Unfortunately  most of the premier dividend growth stocks such as those found on  of Dividend Champions  Contenders and Challengers are currently overvalued 
Dividend Champions have raised their dividends for 25 or more straight years  Dividend Contenders have raised their dividends for 10 to 24 straight years  and Dividend Challengers for 5 to 9 straight years 
However  not every stock on these prestigious lists are above a sound or attractive buy range  But considering the overall high valuation of the market  there is usually a reason or reasons why a specific stock might be going against the grain 
The specific company could be experiencing some problems  the industry it operates in could be going out of favor or the company s stock price is simply experiencing a rational reversion to the mean are typically the primary reasons  The trick is to find and identify a great business that is soundly valued based on solid fundamentals 
The dividend growth stock I am featuring in this article is the Kroger Company  NYSE KR  which is the second largest grocery store in the country  The reason it is currently attractive is because it has reverted to the mean of fair value from being overvalued for all of 2015 and most of this year 
This is my favorite kind of fair valuation find  because I consider the company strong and healthy on a fundamental basis  Consequently  the only reason that I can see for its stock being weak recently is simply because it was previously overvalued based on fundamentals 
Kroger is a Dividend Contender that paid its first dividend in 2007 and has increased it ever since  11 consecutive years  at an average dividend growth rate of 13 2  per annum 
Although the current yield is not that high  the earnings growth and dividend growth past  present and future is expected to be higher than average  Therefore  I offer this to the dividend growth investor looking for total return and above average future dividend growth 

The Kroger Company
Here is a brief description taken directly from the company s website 

 CORPORATE OVERVIEW OPERATIONS Headquartered in Cincinnati  Ohio  The Kroger Co  is one of the largest retailers in the United States based on annual sales  holding the  20 ranking on the Fortune 100 list published in June 2015  Kroger  was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902 
At the end of fiscal 2015  Kroger operated  either directly or through its subsidiaries  2 778 supermarkets  1 387 of which had fuel centers  Approximately 42  of these supermarkets were operated in Company owned facilities  including some Company owned buildings on leased land 
In addition to supermarkets  Kroger operates  by franchisees or through its subsidiaries  784 convenience stores  323 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer  Subsidiaries operated 711 of the convenience stores  while 73 were operated by franchisees through franchise agreements  Approximately 54  of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in Company owned facilities 
The Company also manufactures some of the food for sale in its supermarkets  As of February 1  2015  the Company operated 38 food production plants  All of the Company s operations are domestic  

Although most of Kroger s growth has been generated internally based on its superior competitive advantages that include regional scale and densely cluttered store locations  the company has recently made a strategic acquisition merger which stands to expand their geographical reach and future profitability 


 Kroger and Roundy s Announce Definitive Merger Agreement
Kroger to Add Complementary Footprint of 151 Stores  Including New Wisconsin Geography and 34 Mariano s Locations in Chicago
Roundy s Shareholders to Receive  3 60 Per Share in Cash  Transaction Valued at Approximately  800 Million Including Debt
Company Release   11 11 2015 8 31 AM ET
CINCINNATI and MILWAUKEE  Nov  11  2015  PRNewswire     The Kroger Co   NYSE  KR  and Roundy s  Inc   NYSE  RNDY  today announced a definitive merger agreement under which Kroger will purchase all outstanding shares of Roundy s for  3 60 per share in cash  

The Kroger Company  Fundamental Strength And Growth
In the long run  earnings drive shareholder returns and dividend growth  The following F A S T  Graph plots Kroger s earnings since 1997  Although earnings growth has been a little lumpy  Kroger has produced higher and more consistent earnings growth than any other grocery store that I have reviewed  Additionally  notice how earnings growth has accelerated since 2011 

With this next graph I ve added the light green dividend line  white looking  indicating that Kroger paid their first dividend in 2007  and it has increased it every year since at an average dividend growth rate of 13 2  
The dark green shaded area below the light green line represents the portion of earnings paid out to shareholders  or the dividend payout ratio  Therefore  you can graphically see that the company pays out approximately 20  of their earnings currently  Consequently  the dividend payout ratio is low and there is certainly room for it to grow 

On this next graph  I ve added the company s monthly closing stock prices  the black line   Clearly  we see a high correlation between Kroger s earnings and its stock price over time 
But most importantly  we clearly see how Kroger s stock price became significantly overvalued in 2015 as it disconnected from the orange line  and how it has been reverting to the fair value mean throughout 2016 
This has caused many people to question Kroger s stock  People get agitated when a company s stock price drops  However  to me it is clearly a function of overvaluation 
Therefore  I see nothing wrong with Kroger other than the fact that it was overvalued  Irrational stock price action can occur on any company  and I believe the recent overvaluation on Kroger is a classic example 
Morningstar currently estimates Kroger s fair value at  32 per share  Therefore  I found it interesting that this is approximately the valuation that Kroger s stock price has fallen to 
However  Morningstar has also announced that they have assigned this stock to a new analyst and expect to publish a new fair value estimate by August 19 
Given the company s recent drop in stock price  I am quite curious to see what that might do to their new fair valuation estimate  Note  Morningstar has updated their fair value estimate on Kroger dated August 8  2016 and if The fair value estimate and  32 per share   Here s an excerpt from Morningstar s current fair valuation discussion on Kroger 
Kroger currently trades at Morningstar s current fair valuation estimate 

 Our fair value estimate for Kroger is  32 per share  which implies a forward price earnings ratio of 14 times  an enterprise value EBITDA ratio of 7 times  and a free cash flow yield of about 2   Our base case fair value estimate reflects 0  1  square footage growth annually over the next decade  identical store sales growth of around 3 0  3 5  over the next five years and near 3   the middle of management s 2 5  3 5  long term target  over the latter stages of our explicit forecast period  


With this next graph I ve added the dividends after they have been paid out of earnings  the light green shaded area on the graph    does this to illustrate that the price following earnings is what generates the capital appreciation component of total return  and the dividends paid out generate the income component  Combined they provide the company s total return 

It s important to note on the above graph that Kroger s stock price was fairly valued at the beginning and has now come back into fair value at the end  Consequently  Kroger s capital appreciation over this timeframe of 12 7  correlates very closely with their 11 5  earnings growth rate over this timeframe 
The difference is easily explained because Kroger s P E ratio on January 1  2006 was 13 9 and the current P E ratio on the graph is slightly higher at 15 1  In other words  earnings growth of 11 5  coupled with modest P E ratio expansion from 13 9 to 15 1 explains the 12 7  capital appreciation 

Kroger s Valuation Based On Cash Flow
Whenever I am evaluating a company for prospective investment  I always start out by looking at the company s earnings and price relationship over time  Additionally  I always run multiple timeframes in order to establish whether growth is accelerating  decreasing or staying the same 
However  I also then look at the company s cash flow and price relationship as well  To me  this is especially important when evaluating dividend paying stocks 
The dark blue historically normal price to cash flow  P CFL  illustrates that Kroger s stock price is well within its normal historical range relative to cash flow  In addition to being another important valuation measurement  evaluating a company based on cash flows provides insights into the company s ability to pay and continue paying a dividend 

However  I never stop there  After I reviewed the price to earnings and price to cash flow graphs  I like to look a little deeper under the hood  The following FUN Graph  financial underlying numbers  graphs Kroger s cash flow per share  cflps   operating cash flow per share  ocflps   free cash flow per share  fcflps  and dividends paid per share  dvpps   These metrics clearly illustrate that Kroger s dividend is amply covered by all of its cash flows 
Cash Flow Per Share  cflps   Operating Cash Flow Per Share  ocflps   Free Cash Flow Per Share  fcflps   Dividends Paid Per Share  dvpps 

Grocery stores are notoriously low net margin businesses  However  Kroger does produce strong gross profit margins  and its net profit margin is higher than most of its peers  as indicated below

For a grocery store  Kroger generates very attractive returns on invested capital  The following graphs illustrate Kroger s returns on invested capital for the past 12 quarters  and the second graph plots Kroger s returns on invested capital since 2001 
The following excerpt from Morningstar indicates that they believe that Kroger s attractive returns on invested capital support their moat 
Morningstar s economic moat 

 We believe that Kroger  as the second largest grocer in the U S  with  110 billion in annual sales  has a narrow economic moat due to throughput driven cost advantages and a brand intangible asset resulting from superior locations  private label brands  and consumer analytics  Kroger s ability to sustain excess ROICs  which we project to continue averaging around 11  12   versus our 6 6  weighted average cost of capital estimate   is driven by its ability to drive traffic and volume through its stores at the local and regional level

Looking To The Future  Kroger s Earnings Growth
The consensus long term estimated earnings growth forecasts for Kroger by 9 analysts reporting to S P Capital IQ is 9 24   If these forecasts are reasonably accurate  then long term shareholders of Kroger going forward could enjoy double digit rates of return  including dividends 

Zacks is in agreement with the consensus estimates as evidenced by the following excerpt 

 Zacks  We believe that given the robust identical supermarket sales growth  excluding fuel  for about 50 successive quarters and better than expected bottom line performance for 10 consecutive quarters  Kroger is poised to achieve its long term earnings per share growth rate target of 8  11   We expect the company to sustain its earnings growth momentum  buoyed by the Customer 1st strategy  effective cost management and share repurchase activities  

Summary and Conclusions
Kroger is not the highest yielding Dividend Challenger in the universe  However  it is one of the fastest growing and one of the most attractively valued  Consequently  I suggest that dividend growth investors looking for an above average total return from a high quality and fairly valued dividend growth stock might want to take a closer look at Kroger

190634,412150,KR,Weighing The Week Ahead  Showdown At Jackson Hole ,opinion,"This week s calendar features yet another light week for data  a lot of politics  and slow summer trading  Something has to fill all of that air time  This week the punditry gets their favorite topic     Chair Yellen s speech on Friday may set the tone for post election monetary policy  Sometimes there is also a presentation from a non Fed economist that challenges current policy  Will there be a showdown at Jackson Hole 
Last Week
The important economic news was positive  Despite the impending options expiration  the big story was the lack of action  There has not been a daily 1  move since early July  This is much lower than the normal August volatility 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted discussion about whether the oil price stock price relationship was at an end  My claim is that there was never a solid basis for the correlation  despite the intense focus by traders  It was a good guess about a topic in a quiet week   A    Both TV and print journalists kept  as influences on daily trading  The real story was the lack of volatility  Last week the dead air was filled with a sandwich promotion  This week the news was about a reported theft from athletes at the Olympics  I understand why this story is important for athletics  the host country  the Olympic rules  endorsements and other angles  It has little importance for financial markets  The attention it got highlights the lack of other news 
The Story in One Chart Short
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart from Doug Short  The overall range is very narrow  with stocks remaining near record highs  Doug has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis and several other charts providing long term perspective 


The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The Good 
Homebuilder sentiment was strong again at 60  an  

Initial jobless claims fell 4000 to 262K  Claims have now been below 300K for 76 weeks   Jeffry Bartash    
The first post Brexit news is positive  as UK employment is stronger than expected    
Leading Economic Indicators rose 0 4 percent  This signals continuing slow growth for the next six months   provides analysis and this chart 

Industrial production continued the recent rebound  up 0 7  in July   has the story 
July housing starts   another  solid report  via    
The Bad 
Oil bankruptcies increased  

Fed Facebook page  Undaunted by the prior efforts at transparency  the Fed has launched a Facebook  page  This will not end well 
The Ugly 
Serious consequences from bad information  Here are two quite different examples 
The government believes you to be dead and your benefits are ended   
Airline passengers  conditioned by recent events  hear something perceived as a shot   at JFK results 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  Nominations always welcome  For ideas  go to your favorite conspiracy site and look for people doing data mining and or poets writing about economics 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have another rather slow week for economic data  but plenty of impending big news  While personally I watch everything on the calendar  I highlight only the most important items in WTWA  Focus is essential 
The  A  List 
New Home Sales  T   A good read on an important sector 
Michigan Sentiment  F   The only concurrent data on job creation and spending 
Durable Goods Orders  Th   Volatile July data is relevant to confirm the industrial rebound 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Existing home sales  W   Not as important as new homes  but a solid indicator for the overall market 
GDP   2nd estimate for Q2  F   Old news  but it will be the base for evaluating the rest of the year 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
The big news will be the Yellen presentation at Jackson Hole  Markets will get a hint when the specific topics are announced on Thursday 
Next Week s Theme 
This week s quiet trading might end with a bang  The Kansas City Fed s annual Jackson Hole conference attracts economists and central bankers from around the world  There may be exploration of new policy ideas or hints at new policy directions  This is especially true when the Fed Chair is speaking  It is not a single  unified message  Some presentations may well feature dissenting viewpoints  While it provides food for the punditry  many market participants would prefer a clear policy statement from a single voice  Instead  everyone will be wondering  Will there be a showdown at Jackson Hole  
Several viewpoints have already emerged 
The conference generally has little market impact  even when the Fed Chair speaks 
Too many voices mean there will be no clear message 
The presentations will be too theoretical to be meaningful

Insight for Investors

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Ben Carlson s advice about   He observes that most investors are focused on the risks  giving little thought to the possible upside 

But there s another risk in the markets that most investors don t spend too much time worrying about   a melt up in prices 


It would seem to me that all of the ingredients are in place for a potential U S  equity bubble  Interest rates are extremely low  central banks around the globe are almost accommodative across the board  there is a substantial need for returns from pensions and retirees and a general lack of alternatives elsewhere to invest  That doesn t mean it has to happen  but the pieces are in place for upside volatility  something very few investors believe could occur these days 


In fact  if you look back historically at how stock markets have generally performed  they are much more likely to rise substantially than fall substantially in a given year 

Take a look at the odds

Investors have an addiction  Many of us feel like we can t help it  we buy high and sell low even though it s more logical to do the exact opposite  This addictive behavior is dooming us to a rocky investment experience and underperforming portfolios 


Final Thoughts 
The continuing laments about the Fed seem concentrated among those who have done a poor job of predicting both the policy and the effects  The most recent variant is the complaint that there is not a unified message  and Fed members are not elected 
If the Fed had  even more  political accountability  rates would never increase  Politicians love low rates  The Committee currently includes a group of appointed officials with Congressional ratification  just as we have for the FDA  SEC  FCC  and other regulatory agencies  It is the nature of committees that the members will disagree  discuss  and compromise 
Instead of complaining about a very normal process of the U S  style of government  it is more profitable to pay attention and to accept the diversity 
If the underlying data do not do not send a clear message  why should we expect the Fed to declare an unwavering policy  I expect interest rate increases sooner than the market currently believes  and that it will reflect economic improvement ",2016-08-21,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-showdown-at-jackson-hole-200149122,200149122

4 Stocks to Buy on U S  Dollar Surge

The U S  dollar posted a third week of gains on Friday  close to its highest level in two months  Gains were primarily attributable to higher chances of a Fed rate hike in June  Despite the decline versus the yen experienced on Monday  the greenback s rise is expected to continue in the days ahead 

Companies which primarily conduct their business within the U S  are expected to gain from the dollar s surge  A widely expected rebound in U S  GDP will also give such stocks an added impetus  Adding such stocks to your portfolio makes good sense at this time 

Dollar Rises on Possible Rate Hike

The dollar registered its third successive weekly gain on Thursday  increasing 0 8  over last week  Minutes of the Fed s most recent policy meeting and last week s comments from Fed officials have led to the increasing feeling that a rate hike is likely to occur in June  Moreover  New York Fed President William Dudley said he is  quite pleased  to see strong possibilities of a rate hike in June July  He added that if he sees that his own forecast  is sort of on track  then he thinks that  a tightening in the summer  the June July time frame is a reasonable expectation

Improving Indicators Hint at GDP Rebound

A data dependent Fed has indicated that a pickup in growth in the second quarter would lead them to hiking rates in June  Most reports released in May seem to indicate this is indeed the case  Retail sales rose 1 3  last month  reaching its highest level since Mar 2015  Industrial production rebounded from a 0 9  decline in March to rise by 0 7  in April  posting its highest percentage increase since Nov 2014

Our Choices 

Encouraging economic indicators are providing the Fed with the evidence it requires of an economic recovery to bring about a rate hike in June  The dollar is expected to rise further in this case  In such an event  companies which conduct all their business within the U S  are likely to be in an advantageous position compared to those with substantial overseas operations 

Domestically focused companies are likely to gain further with an uptick in GDP  This is why it may be a good idea to pick such stocks  At the same time  selecting winning stocks is a difficult task

5 Retail Picks to Add to Your Cart as April Sales Shoot Up

Following lackluster growth in the first three months of this year  retail sales have picked up in April  In fact  sales at retailers touched the highest level last month in more than a year  Gains were robust  with auto dealers  gas stations and Internet retailers left grinning  This is a welcome relief  especially after a string of discouraging results from department stores in the first quarter that raised questions about the financial health of consumers 

A steady rise in income levels is also expected to lift consumer spending  which will eventually boost retail sales in the future  Moreover  consumer confidence in the U S  has already gained strength in May  Hence  it will be prudent to invest in fundamentally sound stocks from the retail sector 

Retail Sales Post Biggest Gain in a Year

Sales at retailers jumped 1 3  in April from a month earlier  the biggest gain since Mar 2015  according to the Commerce Department on Friday  This leap in retail sales was led by gains among auto dealers  gas stations and online merchants  Demand at auto dealers moved north at the fastest pace in a year  while sales at Internet outlets were the strongest in almost two years 

Internet and catalog sales had surged more than 10  in the past year as Americans showed more of an inclination to purchase goods online  Departmental stores figures  on the other hand  sank 1 7  over the last 12 months 

Nevertheless  April s gains were broad based with 11 out of 13 major retail categories showing increases  Besides  the  core retail sales  figure that excludes cars  petrol  building materials and food services gained 0 9  in April  the most since Mar 2014  Core sales figure was also revised up 0 2  in March  which was larger than previously reported 

Auto Dealers  Gas Stations and Online Merchants Lead

Purchases at auto dealers advanced 3 2  in April  a sharp reversal from the 3 2  decline registered in the previous month  This figure was more or less in line with industry data  Sales of cars and light trucks increased at an annualized rate to 17 3 million in April  according to the Ward s Automotive Group  April s data indicated that Americans were drawn toward purchasing SUVs and pickup trucks  banking on cheaper fuel costs and low interest rates 

Gas stations posted a 2 2  increase in sales in April  In March  sales at gas stations had increased 3 1   Meanwhile  Internet and mail order sales leapt 2 1  last month  This category includes online vendors 

These e commerce giants are coming up with better results than the traditional retailers  as evident from their recent earnings reports  Nonetheless  the struggling brick and mortar department stores also posted a gain of 0 3  in sales in April 

Retailers Ringing Recession Alarm 

Traditional retailers are left wondering why there is this disconnect between an improving economy and spending at their stores  Both companies have reported a drop in same store sales for the first quarter  while Kohl s profit fell below estimates as well  Macy s also slashed its outlook as sales took a plunge 

Logic  however  says that healthier household finances  as reflected by the increase in income  are expected to shore up profits for such retailers  According to the Commerce Department  personal income increased to 0 4  in March  more than the downwardly revised 0 1  in February  Based on this faster rate of income  it is expected that consumers will be able to spend more in the near term 

Wages have already grown significantly last month  Average hourly earnings ticked up 8 cents in April following a 6 cent increase the month before  Plenty of job opportunities also remain in many high paying industries and with the unemployment rate at 5   there is no immediate reason to remain concerned that the job market is souring 

Top 5 Retail Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio

As mentioned above  improvement in income will help sales at retail outlets to gain momentum in the near future  Wage growth has already propelled U S  retail sales in April  suggesting that consumers could help revive economic growth in the current quarter  U S  consumer confidence also soared to its strongest level in almost a year in May  The University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index for this month came in at 95 8  way ahead of April s final reading of 89 

As the future looks good for the retail sector  supported by April s stellar performance  it will be a smart move to invest in stocks related to retail  We have selected five stocks from the retail sector that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  

However  it is important to remember that picking winning stocks may not be easy  Hence  we have narrowed down our search with a  of  A  or  B   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners 

U S  Auto Parts Network  Inc     operates as an online retailer of aftermarket auto parts and accessories primarily in the U S  PRTS has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Score of  A   Overall  sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers gained 4 5  in April on a year over year basis 

The Kroger Co     operates mostly grocery stores in the U S  KR has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of  B   Overall  sales at grocery stores advanced 2 5  in April on a year over year basis 

Shoe Carnival Inc     operates as a family footwear retailer primarily in the U S  SCVL has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of  A   Overall  sales at clothing   clothing accessories stores increased 1 9  in April on a year over year basis

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  0 42 on  3 75 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
General fears are that the 365 stores will cannibalize Whole Food s core business rather than confront competitive threats from Sprouts  Kroger  NYSE KR  and even Trader Joe s
Whole Foods plans to open 30 new stores this year  3 new 365 stores  and sees an opportunity to open 1200 stores in the long term
Whole Foods is scheduled to report second quarter results tomorrow after the market closes  Despite a nice beat last quarter  earnings over the past 2 years have been quite volatile as organic grocers become a dime a dozen  This month Whole Foods will open its new 365 stores as part of its continuing efforts to cater healthy food to everyone and rid itself of its high price reputation  General fears are that the 365 stores will cannibalize Whole Food s core business rather than confront competitive threats from the likes of Sprouts Farmers Market Inc  NASDAQ SFM   Kroger Company  NYSE KR  and even Trader Joe s  While the new stores will have no bearing  investors will be interested in sales guidance for these new stores moving forward 
Unfortunately  this quarter is expected to be characterized by slowing comp sales and margin contraction largely in line with past trends  The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  0 42 on  3 75 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Per share estimates have increased 8  since Whole Food s last report but still reflects a 2  year over year decline  Revenue on the other hand is predicted to increase 3

Moving forward  Whole Foods is focused on opening new Whole Foods and 365 stores  This year  the company plans to open 30 new stores  comprising three 365 stores and two to three store relocations during fiscal 2016  The company believes that there still exists room for 1 200 new stores in the long run  In the meantime  Whole Foods faces threats on all sides  Whole Food s core business has come under pressure from stiff competition  and accusations of being overpriced  as demand from value driven consumers wanes ",2016-05-04,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/could-whole-foods-crumble-on-earnings-this-quarter-200127750,200127750

Specialty grocery retailer The Fresh Market  TFM  reported higher than expected net income of  20 2 million  up from  2 0 million in 4Q 2013  when it reported fiscal fourth quarter 2014 results on March 5  2015  This is equivalent to  0 55 in Earnings per Share  EPS   At the same time  revenue was lower than expected at  480 5 million 
Net sales rose 12 8 percent to  480 5 million  Comparable store sales or sales of stores open at least a year  were up 3 0 percent to  412 3 million  The company reported  44 8 million in cash from operations vs   35 8 million in the 4Q of 2013  Gross margin expanded 80 basis points  attributed to adjustments in promotions  pricing and costs 
For fiscal 2015  the company announced a strategic decision to exit the California market and focus its efforts on the eastern half of the United States  The Fresh Market announced it will open approximately 19 new stores during the next fiscal year

The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth 

Market Share Versus Profits
Companies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth 

Compared to the same quarter last year  TFM US s change in revenue trailed its change in earnings  which was 914 58   The company s performance this period suggests a focus on boosting bottom line earnings  While the revenue performance could be better  it is important to note that this quarterly change in revenue was among the highest in the peer group thus far  Also  for comparison purposes  revenue changed by 14 55  and earnings by 35 58  compared to the immediate last quarter 

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company s earnings growth was influenced by year on year improvement in gross margins from 33 51  to 34 28  as well as better cost controls  As a result  operating margins  EBITDA margins  rose from 10 75  to 11 93  compared to the same period last year  For comparison  gross margins were 32 93  and EBITDA margins were 8 90  in the quarter ending September 30  2014 

Cash Versus Earnings   Sustainable Performance 
TFM US s year on year change in operating cash flow of 25 35  trailed its change in earnings  This leads Capital Cube to question whether the earnings number might have been achieved from some unlocking of accruals  On a positive note  the increase in operating cash flow was better than the average announced thus far by its peer group 
Margins
The company s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors   1  Improvements in operating  EBIT  margins from 7 13  to 8 59  and  2  one time items  The company s pretax margins are now 6 56  compared to 0 46  for the same period last year

190688,412204,KR,S P 500  Follow The Trend  Buy Weakness,opinion,"In the last few weeks I have been big about trying to gain a  feel  for the markets  Despite the vicious fighting going on in Iraq and the Russians still supplying the separatists in eastern Ukraine  the S P 500 has shaken off the bad news like a good soldier and kept on climbing 
Okay  here s a chart  But even the chart just says what your gut is telling you 

Yesterday the Federal Reserve released its latest monetary policy decision  There was really nothing new  We did not hear about hiking rates quicker and nor did we hear anything about  tapering the taper  
With the Fed taking off another  10 billion of its monthly asset purchases and the S P less than 1  off its contract highs  the S P  CME SPU14  started moving higher  but the question is why  The Fed s latest  includes the  Dot Plot   which shows what the members of the FOMC are predicting will be the path of potential rate hikes 
The latest Dot Plot showed an even wider dispersion than usual of opinion about where interest rates will be in the next 3 years and over the long run  The report basically showed there is no consensus in the FOMC at this time 
Connecting the Dots

As you can see  the projection for the end of this year remains unchanged  but one FOMC member sees rates going to  0 25  to 2 25  by the end of 2015  Interest rates and projection for 2016 have moved from 0 50  to 0 75  
Conclusion  There is no consensus right now on where the Fed thinks rates are going  With no change in the statement  it may be a good idea to  follow the dots   With the ECB lowering to negative rates and the U S  stock market on new highs  there seems to be no reason to hurry to raise rates anytime soon

NO FEAR
Our view  The S P roll is over and the June Quad Witch is on tap  Today  the June expiration study shows the cash S P  SNP  GSPC  up 18 and down 12 of the last 30 occasions and Friday s stats are even better  up 21  down 9 of the last 30  By now  everyone  is bullish and my concern is  what does the S P do for an encore after such a big push up 
But the other side of the coin is the CBOE s fear gauge  the VIX  It sold off to a record low of 10 57 yesterday and my gut is telling me it s going into the low 9 00s at some point  There is no fear 
Our view is to continue to go with the trend  sell the early rally if you like or just make it easy on yourself follow the trend and buy weakness  The ESU is going to 1965 1970 soon

190690,412206,KR,Whole Foods  Long Overdue Crash,opinion,"Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM  dropped 4  on Thursday morning after reporting disappointing sales growth  the most recent hit in a rough 2014 for the stock  Slowing growth  margin concerns  and increased competition have helped send shares down 35  so far this year 
As I wrote back in 2010 

There is a difference between a good consumer product and a good stock  Whole Foods may produce a terrific product  but if they are  1  not able to profit from their product and  2  the stock s valuation is too high  the current price in the high 30s  implies the company will grow revenues compounded annually at 20  for the next 11 years while also improving their returns on invested capital by 25  over the same time  

Thinks Again
What most investors do not know is that Whole Foods is not as profitable as people think  Digging through the footnotes in WFM s filings  we saw that their accounting earnings consistently overstated their economic earnings  For example  we found over  4 billion  110  of reported net assets  in off balance sheet debt  Off balance sheet debt allows companies to obscure the true amount of capital invested in their business  artificially increasing ROE and return on invested capital  ROIC  
While other sites around that time were reporting that WFM earned an ROIC above 10   we recognized its ROIC was actually in the mid single digits  Investors who don t read the footnotes don t get the full picture 
The profitability of the company has actually improved since my 2010 article  ROIC is up from 6  in 2010 to 8  last year 
Adjust Your Expectations
The bigger problem has been that the expectations reflected in its share price remain much too high  As is too often the case with stocks  no matter how good  or bad  the business  the valuation implies future cash flow growth that the company is highly unlikely to achieve 
Stocks with such high expectations tend to be ticking time bombs  It is hard to know when they will crash or which straw  such as a minor stumble on EPS  will break the camel s back  but when they do crash  they crash hard 
WFM remains significantly overvalued despite the recent decline  After my 2010 article  momentum drove the stock up enough that  even with this year s decline  WFM has still outperformed the S P 500  However  the worst of the carnage may not be done 
Hard To Believe
Though it has dropped far enough for it to earn my  Neutral  rating  WFM is still not a cheap stock by any of my measures  At its current valuation of   38 share  WFM has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 2 9  a good bit higher than the S P 500  2 5    More specifically  to justify the current price  the company has to grow after tax cash flow by 12  compounded annually for 18 years  It s hard to believe that Whole Foods  a mature company in a competitive industry  can grow profits at such a high rate for such a long time  For comparison  Kroger s  NYSE KR  NOPAT growth over the past decade has only been 4  
The message here is that overvalued  high growth stocks might work out  for a time  Investors who bought into WFM in 2010 have done pretty well  Investors who bought in 2011 or later are probably hurting  Momentum can drive a stock up far beyond the value of its cash flows  but eventually gravity takes hold  We saw it with Angies List  NASDAQ ANGI   LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD   Zynga  NASDAQ ZNGA  and now WFM  Chasing highflying stocks might lead to short term profits  but it carries the risk of long term pain

 Margins I tell you what  there s more margin pressure now on natural and organic than there s ever been  It seems that it s becoming more and more of a competitive category  And so although margins tend to be better in natural and organic  I don t know that s going to continue for the foreseeable future  

That would be a big shift in the natural foods market and may be indicative of the fact that the mainstream adoption of healthier diets is changing the landscape of the formerly niche industry   High margins and strong demand have attracted competition  But as organic options become more and more widespread  the products may struggle to avoid being commoditized 
On the other hand  I can see a couple of reasons why organic food may be able to maintain its price margin premium over time 
if organic foods are more expensive due to lower crop yields    e g   more losses without pesticides  GMOs    then it would make sense that an organic product would be more expensive than the non organic because the costs per unit of production are higher 
Margins may be defendable because there is a heavy trust factor involved the purchase of organic food  Consumers have to be able to trust that the vendor has made decisions with its supply chain that protect the customer s dietary values  That lends itself to branding  which is one of the best ways to protect margin ",2014-09-16,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-organic-food-maintain-its-margins-226075,226075

Stocks Entering Period of Seasonal Strength Today 



The Kroger Co   NYSE KR  Seasonal Chart


The Markets

Stocks closed firmly lower on Wednesday as energy shares once again dragged upon broad market benchmarks  The drawdown in energy share prices was  fueled  by another significant plunge in Oil prices as the latest inventory report indicated another increase of 1 5 million barrels  Analysts were expecting a decline of 2 7 million barrels  The current read puts oil inventories 52 million barrels above average for this time of year as increased production in the US floods the market with excess supply  Inventories typically decline in the month of December  The price of Crude Oil remains significantly oversold as it attempts to find a low that would correspond with seasonal norms for this time of year  Looking at the monthly chart  the commodity is testing support around the 200 month moving average  a level that has shown some significance in the past  providing support to the 2002 and 2009 lows  Horizontal support remains apparent around  58  below which the 2009 low around  35 would have to be watched  The intermediate trend of the energy commodity remains firmly negative  however  significantly oversold conditions increase the probability of a near term bounce as negative bets are covered  particularly ahead of quadruple witching day a week from Friday and the Christmas holidays  Crude Oil enters a period of seasonal strength in February 





Looking at the Bullish Percent Index of the Energy Sector  the breadth indicator has declined to levels that have typically corresponded with significant lows  at least on a short term basis  When the technical indicator has fallen to levels below 15  tradable lows have typically followed  in some cases allowing for substantial short term gains  as gauged by the Energy Sector ETF  ARCA XLE   Isolating the instances over the past 14 years that the Bullish Percent Index for the sector has fallen below 5  the Energy Sector ETF  XLE  has averaged a gain of 5 24  in the week that followed and a gain of 10 02  in a 30 day period that followed  These bounces can be powerful as everyone that flooded into negative bets is forced to abruptly cover once the perceived direction changes  Seasonal tendencies for energy stocks start to turn positive in January  ahead of the period of seasonal strength for the commodity itself 







With energy shares taking a large hit  the Toronto market was once again impacted  The TSX Composite  TO TLV  is now hovering around the October lows  although  a longer term rising trendline that stems back to the 2009 low remains intact  a segment of that trendline is shown in the chart below   Still  declines below the October low down to around 12 900 remains a possibility  testing what was a previous level of resistance as new support  A break below 12 900 opens the probability that the highs charted in August and September were part of a double top pattern  given the apparent level of long term resistance just above 15 000  Downside pressures in this case could be significant  Seasonal tendencies for the Canadian market turn positive at the end of December as energy and material sectors strengthen into the new year 





Sentiment on Wednesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended close to neutral at 0 96

190757,412273,KR,Asia s Changing Demogrphics,opinion,Hitting its peak in 1965 1970  the population in Asia skyrocketed at 2 5  at annum  outpacing the rest of the world in growth  Today  Asia is home to 60  of the world s total population  or roughly 4 2 billion people  Rapid growth in its population in the past signaled that Asia was and still is a place with consumer growth and market potential  In the past few decades  however  the population growth in Asia has slowed  which led to rapid ageing of demographics across Asian countries  Meanwhile  labor force growth in Asian has also decreased below the world average Across eight major economies in Asian  the downward pattern in population growth is obvious  According to Credit Suisse Research team in Assessing Asia s Demographic Promise   For our detailed demographic analysis  we selected eight Asian countries economies that cover a wide spectrum in terms of population  labour force  economic development  social systems  etc  These are China  CN   Hong Kong  HK   India  IN   Indonesia  ID   Malaysia  MY   Japan  JP   Republic of Korea  KR   and Singapore  SG   Exhibit 7 presents population growth rates of the selected countries with Japan currently undergoing negative population growth and India and Malaysia experiencing slowing population growth over the last two decades  Due to the slowly growing population and ageing population  the old age dependency ratio is increasing in the aforementioned eight major economies of Asia  Changes in fertility rates and mortality rates have led to changing population structures  The child dependency and old age dependency ratios are two summary measures of the population age structure  In the definition used by the United Nations  child dependency ratio is the ratio of population aged 0 14 per 100 population aged 15 64  and old age dependency ratio is the ratio of population aged 65  per 100 population aged 15 64  These ratios reflect the number of dependents relative to the working age population  Exhibit 14 shows that the old age dependency ratio is the highest in Japan in 2010  which makes it the oldest country in the world  Malaysia  India and Indonesia have low old age dependency ratios  The traditional measures of dependency ratios  however  are becoming increasingly obsolete as youngsters today are spending more years in education and entering the labor force at later ages  That is  the appropriate age ranges for the working age population are shifting  As a thought experiment  we also calculate the old age dependency ratios using an alternative measure with those in the 20 64 age range as the working age population  It resulted in higher old age dependency ratios  compared to the traditional measure Looking at the Demographic Transition Model  which represents the transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a country advances from pre industrial to industrialization  we can explain in more detail what changes in demographics are occurring to each group of nations in a similar industrial transition   According to this framework  different Asian countries are in different stages of the demographic transition  India  Malaysia  Indonesia and Vietnam    the younger Asian countries are in stage two of falling death rates  high birth rates and increased population  China is in stage three of falling death rates and birth rates  while the Republic of Korea is in stage four of low birth rates and death rates  Japan is experiencing a stage where birth rates have become so low that they are lower than death rates  leading to a declining and aged population  The fact that Asian countries are in different stages of demographic transition has led to very different patterns of population growth  age structure and life expectancy in these countries  In changing demographics  it is crucial to understand how much working age population growth contributes to the overall GDP   the contribution of working age population growth was very significant in explaining overall real GDP growth in Singapore during 1990  2010 and in Hong Kong during 1990 1999  On the other hand  in Japan and the Republic of Korea  labour productivity growth contributed the most to real GDP growth in 1990 2010  In Japan  the working age population growth fell during 2000 2010 and dragged overall real GDP growth down  In the future  these ageing countries cannot rely much on working age population growth and will have to increase labour productivity growth  Demographics characteristics vary significant across countries in Asia  However  as shown above  the general trend is that birth rates are slowing down and consequently  the population is ageing more rapidly  Therefore  the challenge ahead of Asian economies is how to resolve the labor force dependency continuously shifting over to the older population  The solution will require a structural policy changes across pensions
