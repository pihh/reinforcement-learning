197263,418779,IVZ,Why Invesco Sputtered in 2019    and Where it Goes From Here,news,"A strong stock market like the one we saw in 2019 is generally good news for asset management firms  which invest for their clients 
But not all asset managers took advantage of those tailwinds  including Invesco  NYSE IVZ   Now the sixth largest money manager in the U S   Invesco was one of the worst performing stocks in the sector  returning just 7 4  last year    well below the sector average  
What factors caused the Atlanta based firm to underperform in 2019  And where does the stock go from here 
Challenges in integrating an acquisition
One of the main challenges for Invesco last year was integrating Oppenheimer Funds  which it acquired from MassMutual last May for  5 7 billion  
Oppenheimer Funds brought to Invesco about  246 billion in mutual fund and institutional investment assets  increasing Invesco s total assets under management  AUM  to  1 2 billion  Oppenheimer Funds will complement and expand Invesco s capabilities  particularly with its international and emerging market portfolio management and robust third party distribution platform  

Over the past six months  the company has been working to reduce expenses  eliminate jobs  and streamline its product offerings 
 We ve made tremendous progress in the integration of Oppenheimer Funds  which deepens relationships with U S  clients and expands the capabilities we can offer domestically and internationally  while further scaling our business for the benefit of clients and shareholders   Invesco President and CEO Marty Flanagan said in the third quarter earnings release  As of that point  the company had achieved  501 million in cost savings by streamlining and eliminating duplication    much higher than the  476 million estimate  
But the integration has led to large fund outflows  meaning investors pulled out of their funds  The firm had net outflows of  5 8 billion  which is  4 9 billion more than the third quarter of 2018  The active funds were hit the hardest  with  15 7 billion in outflows 
However  revenue grew by 28  to  1 72 billion year over year in the third quarter  due primarily to an increase in investment and service fees related to the higher AUM from the acquisition  Net income was down 36  year over year to  167 million  Earnings per share fell 44 6  to  0 38 
Eliminating Funds and ETFs
Invesco moved into the next phase of the integration in December  when officials announced plans to streamline its fund lineup  It will eliminate 42 exchange traded funds  ETFs  and 38 mutual funds in 2020  on top of the 11 mutual funds that were liquidated last year 
The plan will further reduce costs by eliminating overlapping fund offerings and moving forward with the best products from both lineups 
It will likely be another transition year for Invesco as it fully assimilates the Oppenheimer acquisition  but the added scale in an industry that is consolidating could put Invesco on solid ground over the long term  The stock is extremely undervalued  with a P E ratio of 7 80  and has a low entry point  trading at  18 48 per share 
For investors looking for a good value stock with growth potential  Invesco might be an option to consider ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmbvq,2066917

on a listen only mode until the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Today s conference is being recorded  If you have any objections  you may disconnect at this time Now  I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today  Marty Flanagan  President and CEO of Invesco  Loren Starr  Chief Financial Officer  and Greg McGreevey  Senior Managing Director  Investments Mr  Flanagan  you may begin Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorThank you very much  and thanks everybody for joining  This is Marty Flanagan  along with Loren Starr  our CFO  and Andrew Schlossberg  Head of the Americas  And if you re so inclined  the presentation is on the website if you want to follow along  That said  we re going to follow the format that we did last quarter where much shorter prepared remarks so we can get to Q A  Loren will get a brief overview of the business results before we get into the questions though And as we ve discussed on previous calls  we view this combination with Oppenheimer s multi growth    multi year growth story that deepened our relationship with Invesco clients  expanded the capabilities offered globally  scaled the business for both the benefit of our clients and shareholders  and we re already seeing that  This expansion meaningfully enhances our ability to grow our business  achieve very strong operating results  and compete in the ever increasing dynamic market environments Importantly  this is a long term growth story  That said  we are seeing real and meaningful signs of the power of the combined firm  We ended the year with just over  1 2 trillion in assets under management  That s a 38  increase year over year  That s a record high for the firm  We also have higher assets under management across all channels and all regions as we ended the year Long term outflows for the year were  34 billion  That s a 11  improvement from the prior year  We hit record levels of revenue and record levels of operating profits for the year ended 2019  We also achieved significant expense savings delivering ahead of schedule and at  551 million is more than  25 million ahead of the synergy target that we talked about at the time of the combination  And we ll continue to look for additional synergies in 2020 Lastly  and importantly  we did return  1 2 billion to shareholders in 2019  And looking ahead  we believe we are well on the path to continue to make progress to move into positive flows in 2020  The key factors that we ve looked at are improving equity performance and several capabilities where they re in high demand  continued very strong fixed income performance  meaningful progress on the integration of our US sales team  strong momentum in our growing China and ETF business  a very strong institutional pipeline  including large ones and solutions  And finally  the clarity on Brexit will help the investors who backs away risk on mindset and we are beginning to see that So  I m going to turn it over to Loren to give our results Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorThank you  Marty  So  I d like to spend the next few minutes highlighting some of the key items for you on the topic of flows  expenses and capital management  So  starting on flows  as you can see on Slide 7  we re seeing year over year and quarter over quarter long term net inflow improvements in the regions of EMEA ex UK and our Asia Pac area  The Q4 net flow growth in EMEA ex UK was driven largely by our ETF business as well as our direct real estate business  So we saw  for example   0 9 billion in the S P 500 UCITS ETF and  0 7 billion in real estate The Q4 growth in Asia Pacific is largely centered in Greater China and is driven by strong flows into our joint venture  The JV flows were  2 6 billion across many asset classes with fixed income contributing  1 7 billion followed by balanced  0 8 billion  We are also seeing quarter over quarter improvement in our UK business We had positive net flows in our institutional business  and that was driven by direct real estate primarily but also fixed income where we had  1 3 billion in real estate and  1 1 billion in fixed income  Our retail flows do remain somewhat challenged  You ll see the majority of the  16 billion in net outflows in Americas was attributable to the retail business  and that was driven by a  9 4 billion in outflows from some of the legacy OFI funds  some of the largest outflows included  OFI global equities  there was  3 9 billion there and the OFI senior loans  2 2 billion We didn t see a natural redemption out of maturity of our BulletShares  There was  1 7 billion out of that activity   0 8 billion came from Invesco International Growth   0 7 billion from stable value  and  0 6 billion from global asset allocation  I d like to note though that about  2 billion of these outflows is due to the previously disclosed New Mexico 529 plan  It was a deal related redemption that we discussed earlier So  on the next page  let s drill down a little bit on net inflows in the Americas  So you ll see on Slide 8 we show the 2019 history of AUM monthly gross sales and net flows for the Invesco and the OFI US active retail products combined  which includes periods both pre and post close  So  another way  this reflects the two firms together over the entire period  including the pre acquisition period So these tables highlight a few points  So first  both the legacy Invesco and OppenheimerFunds have maintained AUM levels aided by the market  Net revenue yields are stable across the timeframe  Second  you ll see our gross sales post close are still well below the pre close levels  and they did dip in Q4 although we did see a stronger December  We ve made progress with the integration of the two sale teams and we worked to provide the teams with the tools that they need to hit the ground running in 2020  but we are not fully operational yet  We do have Andrew Schlossberg  as Marty mentioned  the Head of our Americas business here with us on the call today and he ll be able to elaborate on this during the Q A session Third point I d like to make is  net outflows have been elevated post close  And this is largely a function of the abnormally low gross sales levels in conjunction with performance challenges we have in some of our active equity portfolios  As you can see on the chart in Q4  outflows were impacted due to the previously announced  2 billion deal related redemption of the New Mexico 529 plan  As we get to the second half of 2020  we expect the US retail net flows to be on an upward trend  and this should be driven by improved gross sales levels and moderating redemption rates on many of our portfolios that have recently seen a significant step up in investment performance So next  let s get to expense management and the P L  So  on Slide 9  we set out our revenues and expenses  You ll see revenues included  52 2 million in performance fees in the period compared to  18 7 million in Q3  and that was largely from our real estate business  Of particular note  expenses are up  36 million a quarter that was driven by several factors  among which the most significant was the movement in foreign exchange rates and global markets in the quarter  Despite these factors  we maintain our focus on expense management and achieving our expense synergy targets discussed last quarter So  on Slide 10  we provide additional information about our expenses to highlight the foreign exchange and market impacts and the other factors that drove Q4 expenses above Q3 levels  I d like to walk you through briefly these variances that are shown in each of the columns on Slide 10 before turning to the impact of these items on our 2020 expense run rate So  first  foreign exchange and market  The FX and market both increased expenses in the quarter by  21 million  We saw a strengthening of the pound and the euro against the US dollar during the quarter  Pound was up 7   euro is up 3   we also saw other currencies like the renminbi up 3  in the quarter  Additionally  markets increased significantly where we had the S P 500 up 8 5   MSCI Emerging Markets Index up 11 4   Russell 2000 up 9 5   MSCI All Country Index up 8 5   all that impacted our variable expenses The next column is our integration impacts and you ll see that we realized  3 million in integration savings in the quarter  And there were  9 million more in savings related to compensation that was largely the result of the decline in our bonus pool related to the transaction and integration departures in connection with the confirmed exits of employees in Q4  These savings  however  were offset somewhat in the period by about  6 million in property  office and technology costs  That s related to the step up in outsource admin costs  some of which will go away when we get to a single operating platform by the end of 2020 The third column to talk about is seasonal expenses  We had about  9 million of our operating expenses in Q4 were due to elevated seasonal expenses primarily related to marketing spend  And then  the fourth item is non recurring items  So  we saw about  9 million in expenses following that quarter or occurred in the quarter that were non recurring  and that s largely in the G A area with the small amounts in property  office and technology  These expenses included regulatory  legal settlement  security related expenses as well as product launch costs So  let me next move to the 2020 expense run rate  So  if you ll recall  we indicated in the Q3    in the third quarter that our operating expense levels of  726 million would be a good expense run rate for 2020  but that was assuming FX and market levels consistent with those at the end of the third quarter  So  if FX and market levels remain consistent with the 12 31 19 levels or end of year levels of the revised 2020 quarterly expense run rate will be  755 million per quarter  And that s comprised of starting with the baseline of  726 million as discussed from the third quarter  adding in the fourth quarter FX and market impacts of  21 million or add in an incremental full quarter run rate expense impact of  9 million resulting from the FX and market levels at the end of year end 2019 Then you add in the savings related to integration of  3 million  and then one quarter of the impact of the seasonally high expenses that occurred in Q4 since that will probably happen again since our seasonal  So  the resulting  755 million represents an average quarterly run rate for the operating expenses for 2020  and realistically  I mean  there will be some quarterly variation around this average  A good example of the quarterly variation is the Q1 increase that we often see  or we always see  in compensation expense to the seasonal payroll taxes  which we d expect to be about  15 million to  20 million for the combined organization in Q1 of this year So  the full year 2020 guidance for operating expenses based on year end 2019 market and FX levels is  3 02 billion  And we re confident with our ability    confident in our ability to maintain this level of expense based on year end 2019 market and FX levels  which means that we re achieving our targeted cost synergies of more than  500 million  And we will continue to update you with respect to our ability to generate more and greater cost savings as we move through 2020 So next  let me move to Slide 11 and talk about the increase in operating income quarter over quarter that was offset by some large movements below the line  In fact  non operating net expenses impacted our EPS for about  0 07 quarter over quarter driven in large part by two big non cash items  So  the first was    that we recognized  15 million in negative valuation adjustments on our co investments related to our CLO holdings  These marks are booked on a one month lag  And so  the pickup that we actually saw on the bank loan market in the month of December was not reflected in these results  But importantly  this is a non cash item  This is really just mark to market activity And then additionally  we saw positive market gains on our seed portfolio as you might expect with the strength of the markets in the quarter  But that was offset in other gains and losses by the FX impact of the settlement of an economically hedged cash transaction we had in place related to our intercompany dividend  Basically this item is really just the FX impact on an intercompany loan  This represents about a  27 million swing quarter over quarter  And then once again  this is a non cash item So  let me move to capital management  and you ll see on that slide  Slide 12  I think  that we did have    did not have a significant buyback activity in the quarter  I d also like to note that we paid down our credit facility balance to zero  And then  after completing about  975 million in stock buyback since the announcement of the Oppenheimer deal in October 2018  you ll see that we ve transitioned to a more balanced approach toward capital management with a greater focus on our strengthening our balance sheet So let me just in summary say we remain diligent in our approach to expense and capital management  We continue to pursue greater cost synergies related to the Oppenheimer transaction  We are focused very much so on increasing US sales in the US  and we believe that our sales teams are now positioned for 2020 with the tools that they need to succeed And with that  operator  I think I ll now ask you to open up for Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Robert Lee with KBW  You may ask your question  Your line is open Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good morning guys  Thanks for taking my questions  Maybe despite the start out with the    in talking about the trajectory of new sales in the US  I mean  obviously you ve talked about the integration of the sales force and product performance  But maybe    I m just kind of curious how long do you think the lag is between    you ve had the combine forces now for  I guess  going on about six months and what s kind of the lag between when you get it together and you get out in the field and they start talking to advisors that you think you can really start to see get back to where you    the combined firms you are pre deal And then maybe you also have a little more granularity if there s in the US kind of the handful of products that you think could really kind of drive that demand  where you think you could really kind of leverage sales Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorAll right  Andrew Andrew Schlossberg    Senior Managing Director and Head of AmericasYeah  Hi  Thanks for the question  Maybe it s rather important to kind of take a step back for a minute  While we did put the two companies together six months ago  it was one of the largest asset management transactions in history  as you know  And we started putting the teams together then  and we re just kind of getting them on the field now One of the really important strategic decisions that we took when we integrated the companies was to rapidly change the distribution force to meet where a client needs are moving to  So we took a very holistic look at all of our resources and took a real sense of urgency to try to make change and to fully integrate them systems and people So that was something we wanted to do swiftly and right at close  So  the last six months  we ve made a lot of    we ve had a lot of progress since then  and we positioned ourselves to start to hit the ground running here in 2020  start to see the progress throughout the year  And as Loren said  I think get into the back half of 2020 in a real way  Maybe to get a little more specific about your question though  I think there s three key reasons why we re confident in the progress we ve made  I think  firstly  we ve established what we believe is the leading distribution force in the US wealth management intermediary industry  As I said  the second reason is that we ve built out a single fully integrated team and product line by end of 2019  and that s pretty important that we were able to do that And then  lastly  I think we created a truly relevant platform for top US wealth managers that we serve  And as you know  they re consolidating those relationships pretty rapidly at the asset management level  Let me just put a little color around each of those  and then I ll pause and get to your second question In terms of establishing a leading distribution force  at close  we selected the team and we were about 50 50 from Oppenheimer and from Invesco  So  we ve got the top talent  We also achieved the synergy targets that you re familiar with  but we also repositioned the firm toward growth trend  So  we positioned toward high net worth or IVs  Phonetic  well centers  digital data  things like that  while focusing on core key clients and segments like regional broker dealers  home office platforms  So  we think we ve got that leading team in place now  resources repositioned toward the things I mentioned  I think we feel like we ve built out an integrated team and product line by 2019  We announced the mergers of our products  ETFs and mutual funds in December  That was a big milestone  I gave clarity to analysts that cover our products on where we re going  and I think that was important thing to do  We ve also got territories and training in place  We did a lot of that during the back half of last year to get running for 2020 And then  lastly  in terms of having a relevant set at the top of US wealth managers  we have a significant seat at the table  I mean  now we have over  600 billion with client AUM  With US wealth managers  we have client AUM  with US wealth managers  we have half dozen clients greater than  25 billion in AUM and a top 10 position and the largest active fund categories and the largest sort of alternative beta ETF player out there  So  we ve got everything served up we think for success into 2020 Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystMaybe just a quick but I mean maybe this is a little old fashioned way to look at it  But I guess I ve always historically thought that any distribution forces  I know  some number half dozen  10 strategies products that you kind of focus on  Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah Robert Lee    KBW    Analyst   and really drive  So  just kind of trying to get a sense of what you think those are this coming year Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  No  Thanks  Probably three things I d mentioned  I think the first and biggest driver of our net flows success in the US is going to be in the fixed income space and that s both active and passive  So  as Marty mentioned and you can see in the deck  our fixed income performance is quite strong across the board  Those products are capable and ready and in particular in the muni space  core plus multi sector again across active and ETFs  that s a big area of focus for us and where we think we ll see success I d say  the second is ETFs in general and factors  We had strong momentum in 2019 and we did around  16 billion positive net flows globally in ETFs  In both income and volatility mitigation strategies  that we believe is going to continue to be important to us by the second area And then  lastly  I d say on the redemption side just slowing the redemptions on the active equity strategies  improving performance is common international equity  certain US equity strategies and we think coupled with that product integration clarity that I mentioned  and the sales team focus on those redemptions that should be a point of improvement in 2020 Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking my questions  I ll get back in the queue Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorThanks  Rob OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research  You may ask your question  Your line is open Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystHey  Good morning  Thank you  I think there s been a little confusion on the comment you made in December on inflows and kind of what you said today  So  is the view that you could be in inflow by the end of 2020 or the full year could actually be an inflow year  And more specifically  I think you mentioned earlier a strong pipeline and solutions wins  Could you maybe help frame that a little bit more specifically  And within that  how should we think about the  11 billion solutions when coming through over the next few months Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  Great question  So  we re not talking about the end of the year  We look at it as 2020  We see the line of sight for inflows for the year with everything that we ve just been talking about today  So it s not    you ll start to see it pretty quickly here Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  And I think  in terms of the institutional pipeline  we ve seen continued growth in the pipeline  Quarter over quarter  it grew about 4  to 5  both in AUM and revenue basis  A lot of that is being driven by real estate and other traditional areas  but we re now competing in RFP businesses or opportunities around solutions that we haven t in the past  And so  as a result  we re actually seeing larger scale win opportunities than we ve ever    never    haven t seen those in the past The one that you referenced  the  11 billion  is going to happen probably in the second quarter of this year  I think it was just as we said in the first half  it s probably more likely to happen in the second quarter  We re seeing similar opportunities like this of similar magnitude  plus or minus  that we expect to also be generated as an inflow in this year  So  more to come on the solutions  but we really  I think  are seeing significant success now bringing our solutions capability to clients in a way that we hadn t in the past Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystThank you Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is open  You may ask your question Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking my question  Just a follow up on    wondering whether you have any update thoughts on potential incremental expense synergies  Just want to gauge any relative confidence you have potentially on achieving incremental synergies  And also as well  when you originally broke out the categories for the synergies  there are some longer tailed categories such as property and office as well as G A  Just wondering whether those are the particular areas where you could see some potential incremental synergies  Thanks Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  So  Ken  thanks very much for asking  Yes  absolutely  because when we first talked about this transaction  as you remember  we said that there was a long tail to the integration that would take us through the full year 2020  And they were related largely to some of these technology and back office elements  And I even referenced  obviously  there was  6 million that stepped up in this quarter really to outsource admin cost  and some of that will go away as we get through the end of this year    full expectation  So  order of magnitude is    there s something there  Probably if you look at the numbers  it was in the order of magnitude of  sort of   10 million to  14 million that could be possibly generated  We still feel very confident that those numbers will get delivered I think  as we said in the past  we still are evaluating how much of that might drop to the bottom line  guess    versus getting reinvested in some of the high growth areas that we ve talked about like China or digital  But we are absolutely  through the course of 2020  going to give you full line of sight as to what we think can drop versus what we feel we absolutely need to use for reinvestment Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  And just one follow up question  if I may  Just on that slide showing the US retail active net revenue yield ex performance fees  it looks as it s been pretty stable recently  Wondering if you could just give us some color on any relative impacts from either mix shift or changes to gross fee rates  Thanks Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  Again  so the one thing I would say that obviously this is just ex ETFs  This is really just the core mutual fund products  additional products  There isn t a huge amount of shift that happens between the mutual funds  The biggest shifting that we ve seen really has been the mix between mutual funds versus ETFs  This we don t think is going to change  I mean  even with the sale of more fixed income  I don t think it s going to have a massive or sort of material impact on these types of fee rates But probably  as we do sell and continue to look at ETFs  that will have a bigger impact overall  And so  I do think there s still some amount of expected fee decline for the firm as a whole as we continue to sell ETFs at a higher rate Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  But I think an important point that often gets lost is  don t correlate levels of fee rates to profitability  The ETF business is very  very profitable for us Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan  You may ask your question  Your line is open Ken Worthington    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  Good morning  Can you talk a little bit about the balance sheet  Loren  I think you mentioned the pay down of the credit facility and you talked about reprioritizing the balance sheet with regard to capital management  What does that mean  How aggressive do you want to be here on the balance sheet  Are there any targets or goals that you can share with us in terms of deleveraging or debt pay down or a couple of ratios  that would be great Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  So  I think you should expect us to live up to our commitment of the buybacks  which we ve talked about   1 2 billion  We ve got about  950 million completed through when we first announced  So there s some  200 million left that we re looking to complete in this year 2020  Again  we can do more or less depending on how markets react  But in terms of kind of what you should expect from us  it s probably a much more sort of steady normalized buyback pattern along the lines I m just mentioning versus the very accelerated front end loaded buyback that we were doing when the deal was announced What we want to do is be able to build up some cash  As we ve said  we want  1 billion in excess of regulatory capital levels  Generally we re not quite there yet  So there s still opportunity for us to build some more cash  And we do want to have some flexibility  Come 2022 when some debt is coming due  there s  600 million to potentially allow that to be paid down or we might roll it  But having that financial flexibility by continuing to build little cash is we think prudent Ken Worthington    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  Great  And then  just following up on some earlier questions on the Oppenheimer deal  I think the original target was organic growth of  say  1  to 2  for Oppenheimer for 2020  Is that still a realistic target  And if it is  can you kind of walk us through either by distribution channel or maybe a couple of the big products like  how do you get from sort of the bigger outflows that we ve seen more recently to that flip to 1  to 2  organic growth Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  Let me make a couple of comments and then maybe Andrew can pitch in  So  it s really    we still think it s    that is very typical issue will be timing  right  So  what you can t foresee when you begin these things are relative performance  Loren hit on two important areas  the headwinds around bank loans that came over and one of the international funds  The performance in international is improving  I think it was    Andrew was talking about when you first to look for slower redemptions But when you look through the totality of what s on that platform  we feel very confident about the opportunities  And we re also seeing opportunities outside of the United States already institutionally and also retail in EMEA  So  again  what we saw at the beginning is something that we still feel very confident  and it s going to be an issue of timing Andrew Schlossberg    Senior Managing Director and Head of AmericasYeah  I mean  maybe the only two things I d add is  we saw    I think through some of the disruption that we mentioned earlier and combining the distribution forces  you can look back at Page 8  we re still operating pretty well below our gross sales that we had as two individual companies And just getting back to that level  which we think will happen sooner than later  then lets us sort of go into that acceleration mode  I think you ll see it    we re going to see it on the gross sale side I think to make that pickup happen The other thing I would mention is  we ve been focused a lot on the active US retail position on page 8  but the ETFs are going to be a really important accelerator  And with this stronger distribution force together  we have a lot more energy and resource against growing that business rapidly as well Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  And obviously some of this has to do with the performance of the products  And we ve seen some improvement  Obviously we continue to see an improving trend on some of the core products like international growth as a good example  That s going to really help us achieve those levels  But probably realistically within 2020 getting to 1  or 2  is probably not realistic at this point  and I think we have a path to it Ken Worthington    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  Okay  great  Thank you very much Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America  Your line is open  You may ask your question Shaun Calnan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  guys  This is actually Shaun Calnan on for Mike  Just going back to the product offerings  in 2019  we saw significant pickup in industry ESG flows and it looks like more of a    there s going to be more focus on this from competitors and investors  So I m just wondering what your current offering is there and what your plans are going forward  Thanks Andrew Schlossberg    Senior Managing Director and Head of AmericasYeah  Hey  It s Andrew Schlossberg  I ll jump in in the first instance  We ve been  like many others in the asset management space  investing in the ESG space for some time  So  our first focus really is making sure that sustainability and other ESG factors are incorporated into our active strategies as a factor that they look at  Most of the demand we see from clients  including in places like Europe  is for inclusion portfolios not exclusion  So  our first protocol is to make sure that we re contemplating that Where we anticipate seeing some increased demand though is in ESG portfolios and things that    that s the core focus of it  We ve incubated and put strategies in place across our entire platform  One area of note  and then maybe Marty can pick up more fully  but in the ETF space in the US  we ve been sort of running sustainability focused ETF since 2005  And they are in place  We have  I think  six or seven of them  and we re starting to see more demand  We expect to see more demand into next year  And likewise in Europe  we listed a set of strategies last year to address the same set of challenges and opportunities Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  Okay  If you look at where the impact is  where it s been real  it has been on the continent  If you re not absolutely engaged and focused on ESG inclusion  you have a real business problem regardless of what you think about it  And you can tell in the United States where from my perspective has been more of a conversation  Technical Issue  pick up  So  it is definitely a reay opportunity and really frankly something that is going to be actually pervasive  I d say  throughout the whole industry globally  which is a good thing  Yeah  I would just say  I mean  in Europe in particular  I mean  we just launched some new ETFs that were ESG focused in Q4  I know we have a bank loan capability that s all ESG focused that is also being told and doing well  And the big solution when we had in the US that we ve talked about was actually focused around ESG offering  So  we have the capabilities to deliver on ESG and we re actively pursuing those Shaun Calnan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank  You may ask your question  Your line is open Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Good morning  folks  Can we just go back to the organic growth trajectory and let s put the positive in sort of the timing of that  So  you mentioned  Marty  the institutional pipeline  what s strengthening  Of course  we ve got the    I think it s announced as  11 billion mandate that s funding in the second quarter  if you could just sort of go into the different components of that Obviously  you mentioned Brexit is a little bit more    the situation there is a little bit more favorable  And if you combine the nuance    maybe you can talk about actually the new products that you plan to launch on the Oppenheimer strategies during the year in terms of the institutional products and then the launching of maybe euro down the sales front  How that plays into that trajectory of positive organic growth  It certainly looks like the second quarter  you can achieve that with the funding of the mandate  Do you think you can possibly achieve that in the first quarter given the trends you re seeing so far Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorThe answer is yes  So let me try to hit the highlights  So  you re seeing continued rapid growth in China  we expect that to continue  The ETF business  what Andrew talked about  globally we continue to see that positive flows and increasing  There s more to do in Brexit  but round one has actually been very important  You can already start to see more positive activity on the continent You did see some improvement in our UK business just in the fourth quarter  So  those are two areas where they were very strong contributors to our business a couple of years ago  but as Brexit became very real  I mean  we just saw an incredible drop off in any real activity as people went to the sidelines  So  those are all very positive  along with the institutional business that you talked about  So  again  this is    you re going to start to see  very quickly here  all these things starting to show up in the numbers  And it s quite broad  it s not one area Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorAnd I mean  what we re just seeing is    I mean  solutions is  by far  in a way  the fastest growing part of our institutional pipeline  The other parts continue to grow  direct real estate and bank loans are    they are fixed income as well would be the areas that we see growth and interest Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorAnd you talked about the Oppenheimer  So  right now  I think it was Q4 introduced four different Oppenheimer capabilities into the use of products on the continent and they were often roadshows in Q4  So  again  that s the beginning of that and also where we ve seen interest is  in the global equities  emerging markets equities  emerging markets debt  all outside of the United States institutionally  So  again  they re longer tailed engagements institutionally but they re well known  well recognized and there is real demand for the asset classes Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then maybe just to put two expenses real quick  I missed the comment about the incremental cost sales in 2020 on that  3 02 billion  Maybe if you can just rehighlight the principle  the  3 02 billion  does that include additional market returns in 2020  And then  I know you re still wrestling with when you get cost    incremental cost in the deal you may reinvest them  So  maybe just a little bit more color on if that  3 02 billion could be improved by additional cost saves from Oppenheimer Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  So  on the first question you had  it does not include any incremental market returns that have already happened in 2020  so there may be some lift depending on where  what and how the quarter comes through  It s really based on year end levels  so December 31st levels In terms of incremental cost sales  again  there s probably 10 to 14 that we easily see in terms of opportunity to deliver more synergies  And so that is something that we will  as I mentioned  sort of be able to talk through as we get through 2020 as to how much of that could drop to the bottom line versus not  But the  3 02 billion does not include any incremental sales at this point  It is really consistent with the 501 that we originally talked about Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGood  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo  You may ask your question  Your line is open Chris Harris    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThanks  Just to follow up on the 2020 expense guide  how would equity markets up say 8  or so affect the outlook Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorSo  again    I mean  you can kind of look at what happened in this current quarter to get a gauge where we did have equity markets sort of similar levels  So again  there may be some parallel there  Now  about the market and FX  about half of that was market and half was FX of the 21 that we are showing  So  you can get a sense of sort of roughly  10 million that could be due to an 8  lift Chris Harris    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  great  Helpful  And then  just want to talk to you guys a little bit about Brexit  So  on the one hand actually signing a deal would remove a layer of uncertainty  but I guess there s additional uncertainties regarding how the new Brexit situation might affect the local economy  So  like what are you guys seeing and hearing from your investors  I mean  are you actually seeing some folks saying  hey  look  once this deal is inks  Phonetic  that might remove so much uncertainty that we can get involved in equities again  or I guess I was kind of hoping to get some thoughts about what s driving the confidence there Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  It s a very good question  and people are quick to point out the second part of Brexit is a trade deal and how that s all going to turn out  You could absolutely sense incredible sigh of relief on the continent and in the UK with just round one of Brexit being agreed  You can start to see that in the activity on the continent in particular and fund flows  It s trailing in the UK  but again it s just a total sense of relief that there s a pathway forward How high would that enthusiasm be is unclear  but everybody that you talk about    talked to  there are record levels of cash on the sidelines in the UK and on the continent  And you re not making very much money at all  needless to say  with the rate environment and negative rates in particular  So  that s why you re starting to see some sort of activity emerge  Yeah  I can t predict how disruptive this next round of trade talks will be  but everything that we re seeing is    round one is actually a very  very important positive step Chris Harris    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next questions comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies  You may ask your question  Your line is open Dan Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  Good morning  So  a follow up on expenses  and I understand you re talking about synergies and incremental savings  but if I were just to look at core Invesco and we re sitting here today after the kind of the results and the flows you re seeing  I think we would be talking about cost cutting or other ways to curtail investments  So  could you talk about    obviously you have the integration on what you ve outlined and you ve achieved there  but at the end of the day  the business are doing worse than you expected  So  what are you doing  I guess  when we think about incrementally to adjust for an environment that we are now And I think you ve talked about any additional savings or expenses being    have to be reinvested into the business  So  can you help us think about a market backdrop  maybe that s not as favorable what you can do  or other things beyond just the integration that are keeping expenses under control Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  Great question  Dan  So  I mean  we have been very focused on this deal and the synergies coming out of this deal  but I want to say it s not where our focus stops  So  there is a greater    larger focus about what happens sort of day two kind of ideas around how can we make the entire firm more effective  more efficient  And there is work being done completely separate from the Oppenheimer transaction about looking at how can we simplify some of our technology and systems particularly sort of some of the systems that may not be directly back office or middle office  but others that sort of get more into investment support and other things that could simplify the way we manage our various capabilities  And that s just as an example of something that is interesting to us  because obviously we do have a fair amount of technical data associated with supporting multiple teams  There may be opportunities for us to sort of streamline some of that infrastructure  So  that s a good example of an area that could be quite large Other things that have been clearly talked about beyond Invesco but we re actively pursuing is how can we move more to the cloud having things that are on premise  Phonetic  is very expensive  There is a lot of maintenance and support required for that kind of physical maintenance  And so  if we can move more to the cloud  there really is a significant opportunity to sort of eliminate a lot of cost  data centers  and other things that are just not necessary anymore So  those are things that we re working on through 2020  probably as we get through it  it s more of a 2021 opportunity for us  But we absolutely will want to talk further through 2020 about some of these ideas as well not just the Oppenheimer ones Dan Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And then  can you expand upon the MassMutual relationship and what has happened or what you are planning in terms of 2020 from a contribution through that channel of those advisors and what kind of the potential could be there Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  I ll make a couple of comments and Andrew can chime in  So  obviously the first quarter call is  there are 8 500 advisors and literally it s onboard and capabilities that they couldn t make available historically looking at areas of alternatives that could be made available to that sales force  Also  and some conversations going on looking at the general account around the product portfolios capabilities that we have that they will take on as mandate  So  again  it s a very strong relationship and we re expecting it to be beyond the important shareholding that they have  but also doing business together Andrew Schlossberg    Senior Managing Director and Head of AmericasYeah  The only thing I d add is on the advice insurance side  one of the bigger opportunities we usually see is with model portfolios and solutions into that channel  open architecture but also highly inclusive of our active and passive strategies  And so that s what we see as maybe one of the larger opportunities in the advice channel Dan Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystAnd is that in 2020 or is that beyond Andrew Schlossberg    Senior Managing Director and Head of AmericasThanks Dan Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS  You may ask your question  Your line is open Adam Beatty    UBS    AnalystThank you and good morning  This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan  Just wanted to focus in on China a little bit more and your business there  It sounds like things are going well  Appreciate the breakdown on the flows  Just wanted to get a sense in terms of the financial contribution  the magnitude and timing that you might be expecting  Also  any regulatory updates and when you might increase the stake in the JV  And finally  any thoughts on the competitive there  Thank you Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  So in terms of the financial  again  I d point you to our press release  We do provide detail in the footnotes that allow you full transparency in terms of the revenue and the expenses in our joint venture  What you ve seen is that the margins sort of somewhere between 40  to 55   I mean it moves around a little bit quarter to quarter  I think it dipped down a little bit this quarter but generally they re well in excess of the firm s margins  and it is a business that has the same kind of very positive incremental margins  You d expect for something that has generally higher fees  and there s been a lot of infrastructure necessarily required to support the growth  So financial  I think it is a one that is going to help accrete our margin as we continue to see that business grow I forgot the other part of your question Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  I ll pick it  So  the shareholdings  we continue to be    there s meeting of the minds that will increase the shareholding  We re not we ve not come to final terms  But I think a very important point is it s less relevant for us than others because the point is we have management control  and we have had management control of the joint venture  And so  we operate in China as really a combined firm because of that  And that s what s unique about it If you look at the competitive nature of it  those estimates that half the flows in the industry over the next 10 years can come from China  We ve been managing Chinese securities since 1992  The joint venture was 2004  Very strong expertise managed clients in China  50 billion of Chinese whether it d be large institutions or the retail business  and we continue to see growth  So it is people look at as an opportunity  The fundamental fact is very competitive  And to me  my sense is that the start up time to become successful is quite long tailed  So having the depth of capabilities and tenure and experiences  what we looked at is a very important competitive advantage for us Andrew Schlossberg    Senior Managing Director and Head of AmericasYeah  I think I also say just the investment performance of the products that they re managing is spectacularly strong  And so  they really do have a wonderful position in the market right now  and    which has allowed them to be able to launch products probably more rapidly than others just because they re seen as being experts in this area when regulators are looking at  kind of  who s equipped to do these product launches Adam Beatty    UBS    AnalystYeah  That s great  Appreciate all the detail and the nuance on the control  That s all we had  Thanks very much Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorThank you Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah OperatorThanks  Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs  Your line is open  You may ask your question Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  Good morning  guys  I wanted to pivot the discussion on organic growth from AUM to fees for a second  I guess first  maybe you could talk a little bit about the fee rates on the  11 billion  when you expect to fund in the second quarter  And then  Marty  just given your comments around line of sight on positive flows for the year  what are the fee rates you guys expect to get on that pipeline  And I guess just taking a step back  if you could talk about organic fee growth for 2020 as opposed to organic AUM growth  that would be helpful Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  So  I think what we said for solutions  that s a solution  kind of typical fees  So  I think single digits  So  it is not higher fee  it tends to be at a lower fee  which is generally what we re seeing  I mean  a lot of the capabilities are going to be in the ETF space as well  So  again  it s somewhat consistent with the overall index strategy So  in terms of overall fee progression  I think we said we re not into forecasting  kind of  fee rates just because it is so hard with mix and hard to figure out different things around foreign exchange and market that moves that around  But clearly with ETF s growth  you ll continue to see some focus on fee rates coming down as ETFs become a more prominent part of our overall mix But as Marty mentioned  it s not a margin sort of dilutive  This is a very positive margin    high incremental margins for that growth  So we actually have no issue with sort of our fees coming down due to the ETF s growing The bigger topic has been outflows in the higher fee product  And so that s the wildcard in terms of productiveness  And we ve talked a little bit about how quickly can we sort of stem what we ve seen around some of those higher fee redemptions  We re hopeful that we can get there through some of things we ve talked about  But that s the bigger part to forecast and is the hardest wanted to say how quickly that s going to happen Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  thanks  And then  the second question I had for you guys was just around the non US growth dynamic  particularly UK and Europe  So clearly lots of money on the sidelines  You mentioned that  and we have as you see some of that as well  As you think about prospect of some of that money coming back into the investment products  can you share some of the perspective of whether or not you think it s going to be more of a money flowing back into the active products or the passive products  So just some flavor what you actually hearing from the distribution channels in the UK and on the content that would be helpful Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  I ll make your comment Loren can pick up  So what you saw last year  Our ETF flows were sort of record flows right  So the second largest inflows in Europe into our ETFs that s going to continue  Look it s early days post the Brexit  but the focus on active is actually picking up and we re seeing that early trend  And again  I mean  we re not even    we re almost done with January  So I don t want to extrapolate too much  but there has been a change already Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  I mean  I would just say  I think probably it s going to be a mix  but probably there is going to be a heavy component of ETFs flowing into Europe  Really  we ve seen that and we don t expect that to change what we do think is probably helpful that some of the active is going to start coming back  We have some great products that are performing really well  European balance high income  European corporate bonds are examples of the products that are doing really well from a performance perspective  So  our European lineup on active is actually pretty strong  And so  any sort of improvement on the risk off we re getting more risk on is going to be helpful for some of those cross border flows coming back to us Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI think I might just add two quick things  one is that initially cash balances being high the equity demand has been so depressed the last few years that just a pickup back into equity strategies off a low base is both active and passive we expect  And then the other thing I d mentioned  which is relevant in EMEA  but also globally that we didn t talk about was  we re seeing more demand come into alternative strategies throughout the world  Institutionally  I mean emerging retail  So I probably look for flows to return there as well as people come off the sidelines Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThat s helpful color  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse  You may ask your question and please standby  Your line is open Craig Siegenthaler    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Good morning  First  I just wanted to come back to be positive net flow commentary earlier in Q A  were you specifically called out the Oppenheimer international fund  just given the trailing performance that fund  I wanted to hear why you thought flows would be improving over the next several quarters Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYes  So the one year performance has significantly improved on that particular product  And screaming a little bit to see if I can find it right now  so I can actually tell you  but I think we ve seen a real pick up in is it  Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorIt is 32nd Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing Director32nd percentile on a one year basis Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorOne year Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorOkay  So it s definitely improved from where it was  So it s not so much that it s going to turn it around dramatically  but it will allow us to protect it and sort of maybe stem redemptions little  So that s going to be a big help to the flow story overall Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorIt s a well established team with high conviction and again money comes back also into the international equity space with some of the headwinds changing or continues to come in with the performance improvement we feel better about the redemption rate Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  I mean just anecdotally  I know it s a short period  but I think on a three month basis it s a percentile  So it s really come up well and so near term it s definitely performing well Craig Siegenthaler    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Loren  And then just my follow up on Jemstep  Can you provide us an update on this business and also do you know what the current AUM contribution is from Jemstep  which I assume would mostly be inside of PowerShares Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  So  the total digital platform right now  there is  900 billion in assets under administration  So it is due to certain to come online  Pretty quickly you will see some advancements of clients into Jemstep here and then next little while the business on the continent continues to be very  very strong  This fourth quarter  we talked about the model portfolio launch  clients are starting to come online in that we suspect up probably mid year before you start to see meaningful flows into that  but again we feel really good about the strategy and you ll start to see some good things happening here  but we ll talk holistically about Loren M  Starr    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Managing DirectorYeah  I think  I don t have much more to add other than  Yes  so it s a huge opportunity  I think is less than 2  of Invesco AUM and the share of you just mentioned  So  it s not material at this point  but the opportunity that is before us in terms of being able to actually penetrate the AUAs is very real one  So I think it s a story for 2020 that we hope we re going to be able to tell more fully Martin L  Flanagan    President  Chief Executive Officer and DirectorAnd to put in a context  So with the active model portfolios that were introduced in the UK about 18  to 20  of that content is Invesco products  And so you put in the context of open architecture and the other distribution platform if you had 18  to 20  of the mark share that would be is basically 4 to 5 times higher than having a successful position and a traditional platform Craig Siegenthaler    Credit

197274,418790,IVZ,Fallen fund star Woodford s firm suffers ignominious end,news,"By Simon Jessop  Sinead Cruise and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON  Reuters    Once one of Britain s most celebrated money managers and idolized by a legion of investor devotees  the collapse of Neil Woodford s business has been swift and brutal 
The 59 year old moved quickly to call time on his eponymous asset management company late on Tuesday  hours after being sacked as manager of the firm s flagship fund by its administrator  Link Fund Solutions 
The move followed four months of efforts to sell out of a number of unlisted and little traded stocks   some 20  of the fund s portfolio according to Britain s regulator   and raise cash to pay off investors irked by weak returns 
With bad news swirling  attempts to raise enough cash were hampered further after some of his biggest investments   including healthcare technology firm BenevolentAI   were revalued at much lower levels 
Woodford s team had initially been given until December to execute on their plan and had hired bankers PJT Partners to aid their efforts  The team also traveled the length and breadth of Britain to persuade advisers and investors to keep the faith 
But on Monday  Link pulled the plug 
In a letter to investors on Tuesday  Link said it was closing the fund as it did not believe the repositioning of the portfolio would be completed by December  potentially leading to a need to suspend again  to the detriment of investors 
In announcing the closure of the firm late on Tuesday  Woodford said he deeply regretted the impact on investors  A spokesman for Woodford was not immediately available for further comment on Wednesday 
A spokesman for Link told Reuters on Wednesday it had always acted in the best interest of shareholders   of which almost 300 000 came from Britain s biggest online investment platform  Hargreaves  Lansdown  L HRGV   Hargreaves customers accounted for less than half the investments in the fund 
Woodford was initially surprised and then dismayed by the decision  a company source with direct knowledge of the meeting told Reuters 
 There was no indication of their intentions before that at all     So this was a real surprise   the source told Reuters 
Dozens of investors equally stunned by the action posted angry messages on Woodford s website  with many also questioning both Link s decision and the role of regulator the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA  
 You made some very strange decisions in my time invested here Sir   said one former investor on Woodford s website   I m just relieved I reassessed my decision in early 2018 and made my redemption when I did  it saved me a fortune  
As a  value  investor  Woodford made his name during a storied 26 year career at U S  firm Invesco  N IVZ  by buying shares in companies on which the market had become too pessimistic  hoping to chalk up outsize profits as good news eventually came through and was reflected in the share price 
That style served him particularly well at two junctures  the tech bubble at the turn of the century and during the great financial crisis of 2008 2009  In both cases  he suffered periods of underperformance only to come good in market beating fashion as many rivals faced meltdown 
Woodford s reputation as an active manager  in a world where investors are increasingly turning to index tracking funds  helped him to grow his assets to more than  30 billion before he struck out on his own with the launch of Woodford Investment Management in 2014 
Once the starting gun was fired  that name spurred investors to invest in first the Equity Income fund  then the listed  Woodford Patient Capital Trust   L WPCT  and  in 2017  the smaller LF Woodford Income Focus fund 
Yet as far back as Invesco  the seeds of Woodford s demise could be seen in his desire to invest a small proportion of his fund in riskier  less liquid investments 
Freed from the more restrictive corporate shackles of Invesco  Woodford became a major backer of technology start ups  many of them spinning out of Britain s top universities and with the potential to change the world in sectors such as healthcare 
His more conventional yet contrarian take on public market stocks had also led him to double down on deeply unloved sectors such as UK housebuilders   hit by uncertainty around the impact of Britain s exit from the European Union 
As such  from late 2017 he started to seriously underperform his peer group  triggering outflows of client cash and forcing an almost continual restructuring of the portfolio as he sought to make sure he had enough money on hand to pay off investors 
While that worked for a while  a crunch point was hit in June  when he ran out of money after the pension fund of public sector workers in the county of Kent in southern England  asked to withdraw its cash  triggering the suspension 
Some  though  feel Woodford deserved more time 
 I would much prefer Woodford to sort things out as he has skin in the fund both financially and in terms of saving his reputation   investor Julian Thornett said ",2019-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fallen-fund-star-woodfords-firm-suffers-ignominious-end-1997146,1997146

197328,418844,IVZ,Is Invesco  IVZ  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Invesco Ltd    NYSE IVZ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Invesco has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 82  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 88  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Invesco s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 48 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 12  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Invesco has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 86  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Invesco stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Invesco has a P S ratio of about 1 50  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Invesco currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Invesco a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Invesco is just 1 03  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 65  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  IVZ is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Invesco might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F  This gives IVZ a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and three down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has jumped by 2 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Invesco Ltd  Price and Consensus   Apart from this bullish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineInvesco is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 35  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might

197441,418957,IVZ,Is Invesco  IVZ  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Invesco Ltd    NYSE IVZ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Invesco has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Invesco s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number remaining more or less stable over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Invesco has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Invesco stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Invesco has a P S ratio of about 3 0  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is just slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years As we can see  the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Invesco currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Invesco a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Invesco is 1 2  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1 4  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  IVZ is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Invesco might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B  This gives IVZ a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Invesco PLC Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineInvesco is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a good industry rank  among the Top 42   and strong Zacks Rank  Invesco looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value

197451,418967,IVZ,Meet Riot Blockchain  Wall Street s Latest Trendy Stock,opinion,"Riot Blockchain   NASDAQ RIOT   briefly gained more than 15  in morning trading Tuesday  extending the stock s strong run and lifting it to a new 52 week high  Shares quickly fell from that peak  but the former biotech equipment company  which now focuses on buying cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses  have still soared nearly 50  in the past five days 
If you are feeling left out of the fun or if you are thinking  What the heck is a Riot Blockchain   don t worry  you are not alone  The company has exploded into popularity on investing social media forums only recently  and for many  Riot s business model is still relatively unclear 
Let s start with what we do know  On Wednesday  Oct  4  a small firm focused on manufacturing biotech diagnostic machinery  Bioptix Inc   changed its name to  Riot Blockchain Inc   in the hopes of more accurately representing its new focus 
Based in Castle Rock  Colorado  Bioptix found itself in dire straits recently  The company was once known as Venaxis Inc   but it changed its name after buying out BiOptix Diagnostics Inc  in 2016  According to company management  that acquisition turned out to be a mistake 
 When I got on the board  they had made an acquisition that we decided as a board did not make sense  so we closed that down and then decided to change our focus   Riot Blockchain CEO Michael Beeghley told  last month   We looked at the sector and said   How can we participate in this  and how can our shareholders participate in this very exciting industry that s like the beginning of the internet   
But what exactly is this exciting new industry that Beeghley speaks of  We know that Riot s new focus is to invest in companies that utilize blockchain technology or engage in the cryptocurrency business  but what does that even mean 
Let s define some key terms here  First up  the word  cryptocurrency  refers to any form of digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions  verify transfers  and control the creation of new units 
A blockchain is basically a continuously growing record book that uses cryptography to link and secure individual records  which are called  blocks   By now  you have likely heard of bitcoin  the world s most popular cryptocurrency  Bitcoin helped revolutionize digital currency because it utilized blockchain as the public ledger for its transactions 
According to Riot Blockchain s official website  the company has launched its own bitcoin mining operation and intends to  gain exposure to the blockchain ecosystem through targeted investments in the sector  with a primary focus on the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains  
Riot s first move under the new name was to invest in Coinsquare Ltd   a Canadian company that operates an online cryptocurrency exchange  Riot also boasts stakes in Tesspay  a blockchain based escrow service for wholesale telecom carriers  as well as Verady  a cryptocurrency accounting service 
In the near term  Riot Blockchain will face questions related to debt and revenue  The sale of the company s Bioptix assets might have generated some cash  but after a problematic acquisition and a minimal revenue year  Riot is likely deep in the red 
Nevertheless  management has already made some attempts to answer its critics  On Tuesday  Riot announced that it appointed Frank M  Bishop  a former top executive at Invesco   NYSE IVZ    to its advisory board 
Bishop s experience at one of the world s largest investment management companies should be valuable  and his appointment could add legitimacy to Riot s new business direction  Still  with share prices skyrocketing  investors will want to see results fast

197531,419047,IVZ,These 4 U S  Stocks Tanked Over 10  After Brexit ,opinion,"Last week s decision made by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union sent global markets sharply lower  but there were several U S  based stocks with larger European exposure that were absolutely hammered in trade after the decision 
In the last two trading sessions after the Brexit decision was made  the following stocks lost more than 10   and could continue to feel the effects of the decision for the foreseeable future due to heavy exposure to the region 
Manpower Group Inc    NYSE MAN  
A global leader in the employment services industry  Manpower Group Inc  suffered heavy losses after the Brexit decision  with its shares plunging more than 21 5  in its last two trading sessions  The company believes that the UK s exit from the EU will have a significant effect on its business because EU workers will not be able to move freely to the UK 
Nearly two thirds of the company s revenue comes from Europe and the UK  with the UK attributing nearly 10  of the company s total revenue  This dependence on the area leaves the company incredibly vulnerable to regulations and changes enforced as a result of the Brexit  and could hurt its stock even further 
 MANPOWER INC WI Price   Invesco Ltd    NYSE IVZ  
 
Atlanta based asset management firm Invesco Ltd  also saw a major drop in its share price after the Brexit decision  as IVZ fell more than 20  in its last two trading sessions   1 3 billion  nearly a quarter of the company s revenue  came from the UK last year  leaving IVZ vulnerable to feared economic problems that may arrive in the region 
Invesco was also downgraded by Citigroup   NYSE C   on Monday  from buy to neutral  which also caused the stock s plunge  The group s price target was lowered from  38 down to  27  and said the stock was likely  dead money  as investors consider the effects of Brexit 
 INVESCO LTD Price   The Priceline Group Inc    NYSE C  
 
Online travel and restaurant reservation provider Priceline Group Inc  also saw its shares slide after the Brexit decision  as PCLN sank 15  lower in its last two trading sessions  The company was not alone  as many travel stocks saw major sell offs after the decision  though PCLN saw one of the worst drops of all 
Approximately 15  of Priceline s bookings are estimated to come from the United Kingdom  leaving the company susceptible to a drop in travel in the region  Priceline also owns Dutch based Booking com  which does a great deal of business in the UK and Europe  which could also see a decline in business and hurt Priceline s revenues 
 PRICELINE COM Price   American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL  
 
Although its shares were up nearly 5  Tuesday in early afternoon trading  American Airlines Group Inc  saw a major sell off after the Brexit decision as well  with its shares sinking 17  in its last two sessions  Nearly 20  of the company s revenue came from the Atlantic region in the last 12 months  which includes the UK  and flights to the UK account for 6 2  of AAL s capacity 
The company also has a joint venture with UK flag carrier British Airways  further exposing the company to the region  Unfortunately for AAL and other airlines with heavy traffic to the UK  the International Air Transportation Association estimates that Brexit could reduce UK air travel passenger volume by 3  5  by 2020 on decreased GDP figures 
 AMER AIRLINES Price   Bottom Line
 
Though these stocks are all based in the US  each has significant exposure to the UK in terms of their businesses and revenues  leaving each vulnerable to any economic downturn or regulation changes in the region  While the effects of Brexit and the direction of the UK s economy on these companies is yet to be determined  it will definitely be something for investors to watch in the coming months ",2016-06-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-4-u.s.-stocks-tanked-over-10-after-brexit-200138797,200138797
