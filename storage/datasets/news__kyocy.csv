5980,227495,KYOCY,Japan Stocks Hit Record High  2 Stock Picks,opinion,"The Nikkei 225 hit a 15 year high on Wednesday even as the Bank of Japan left its monetary policy unchanged  Ignoring the lone voice of dissent  a majority of the central bank s policy board voted to keep asset purchases at their current level  Meanwhile  opinion is divided as to whether stimulus should be wound down or increased over the coming months 
Destabilizing Financial Markets
Some central bank officials believe that the current program of monetary stimulus may have some undesirable consequences for financial markets  In particular  it could harm bond markets and lead to potential bubbles  which could potentially be harmful over the longer term 
Monetary stimulus has boosted stocks to record highs and pushed the yen lower  Both these effects have proved beneficial to the economy in the short term  However  the BoJ s measure of inflation declined to zero in February  This has led to fears that financial market distortions may arise even before the inflation target is achieved 
Risks of Delaying Additional Stimulus
On the other side of the debate are calls for further additional stimulus  Some market watchers believe that equity market gains have been the only perceptible positives for the economy  Excluding this stock surge  there is little Prime Minister Shinzo Abe can show as tangible results of his stimulus measures 
Some of the original proponents of Abenomics believe that the central bank should not delay additional stimulus for too long  They point to weak consumer spending and the reluctance of large manufacturers to increase investment  This could soon lead to deflationary tendencies  they believe 
Kuroda Resilient
The central bank s governor Haruhiko Kuroda dismissed the proposal to reduce the size of monetary stimulus  Speaking at a news conference  he said that since price stability had not been achieved  such reductions were unlikely at this time 
At the same time  Kuroda said he believes that monetary easing has been effective  Emphasizing the reduction in the gap between supply and demand  he also spoke about the increase in nominal wages and improving inflation expectations  He also said that once the oil price situation stabilizes  Japan will achieve its inflation target  Further  he denied that a stock market bubble was building up  attributing such gains to strong earnings 
Despite calls for further monetary easing  Kuroda denied that further action in this direction was on the anvil  He believed that last October s concerns had been addressed  This was when stimulus was increased over deflationary concerns  following the slump in oil prices 
Our Choices
Despite some element of risk  Japanese markets continue to make steady gains  Below we present three stocks which will gain from these trends  each of which also has a good Zacks Rank 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc  NYSE MTU  is the world s largest bank holding company with  279 2 trillion in total assets as of Dec 31  2014  The company trades on the Tokyo  Osaka  New York  and Nagoya stock exchanges

The central bank governor s confidence in current policy measures may yet bear fruit  At the same time  further stimulus over the next few months cannot be ruled out  This is why these stocks would make for a prudent choice ",2015-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/japan-stocks-hit-record-high:-2-stock-picks-247773,247773

5982,227497,KYOCY,4 Top Japan Stocks To Buy On Abe s Overwhelming Win,opinion,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s sweeping election victory paves the way for ultra easy monetary policies that have driven stocks to the highest level in two decades  With more money expected to be circulated in the economy  the Japanese yen fell against the U S  dollar 
A weaker yen generally bodes well for Japan s exporters  In fact  the country s exports grew for the 10th straight month in September on higher overseas demand  Banking on the bullish trends  investing in sound Japanese exporters appears judicious 
Abe s Big Win
Abe s Liberal Democratic Party  LDP  secured a thumping victory in early parliamentary election  His ruling coalition scored a two third majority in the Lower House election  The party secured 313 seats in the 465 seat lower house  LDP alone won 284 seats  giving the 63 year old political veteran a mandate for reform  both constitutional as well as economic 
Abe s gamble on an early election paid off  despite pre poll elections showing a drop in his approval ratings  His victory gave him a chance to lead Japan through 2021  and the landslide win decimated his weak opposition 
Among the opposition parties  the Constitutional Democratic Party  CDP  won only 54 seats  The party was established about two weeks ago by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano  Governor Yuriko Koike s Kibo no To  Hope  party secured just 49 seats  which she called a  tough result  
Japan Stocks at Two Decade High  Yen Weakens Against Dollar
Financial markets cheered the victory of Japan s pro business Prime Minister  The Nikkei Stock Average went up 1 1  to 21 695 on Oct  23  its highest peak in two decades  The benchmark index also posted its 15th consecutive rise and its longest winning streak in almost 70 years  The broader Topix index also added 0 84  to finish at 1 745 25 points 
The Japanese yen  on the other hand  fell to its lowest level against the dollar since July amid expectations of ultra loose monetary policy by the Bank of Japan  BOJ    After all  Abe s victory has given hopes that BOJ s monetary easing  including moves like introducing negative interest rates and an innovative yield curve control program will persist  This in turn will increase the country s money supply  causing a proportional long run depreciation of its currency and supporting Japan s exporters in the global markets 
Let us not forget that Abe s economic steps better known as   Abenomics  are based on  three arrows   one of which includes monetary easing  The other two are fiscal stimulus and structural reforms 
Japan Exports Rise for 10th Straight Month
Meanwhile  Japan s trade surplus leaped on strong exports to the rest of Asia  Japanese exports climbed 14 1  to 6 8 trillion yen   60 3 billion  in September from a year ago  The gains marked the 10th straight monthly improvement  banking on a recovery in overseas demand and a weaker yen  Exports to China  in fact  surged 29  after its economy performed better than anticipated this year 
Analysts are further expecting an uptick in export growth  thanks to a rise in demand in the holiday shopping season  An Oct  1 BOJ report showed that confidence among Japan s largest manufacturers is at the highest level since 2007  On the same day  the International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for Japan s economic growth to 1 5  for 2017 and 0 7  for 2018  up from its July projections of 1 3  and 0 6  
4 Solid Choices
Abe s landslide victory is a shot in the arm for major Japanese exporters  which should see stronger profits from a weaker yen  This calls for investing in such stocks which also flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

5983,227498,KYOCY,7 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Own Before Earnings,opinion,"Here are seven stocks with exposure to the semiconductor industry  trading at a low P E multiple  and have yet to report their Q3 17 earnings 
A Semi Surprising Earnings Season
This earnings season has been a story of semi surprises thus far with 275 members of the S P 500 having reported as of Friday  October 27  According to Factset  76   209 of 275  of companies that have reported Q3 17 results have beat their EPS estimates  This is above the trailing 4 quarter average EPS beat percentage of 71  and well above the 5 year average of 59   In addition  these companies have beat their expected earnings on average of 4 7  which is also above the 5 year average of 4 2  
The reason this earnings season has been semi surprising is due to the minuscule impact these positive surprises have had on share prices  Companies that have reported upside earnings surprises have seen an average price impact of only  0 1  immediately following the announcement  Investors typically expect a stock to jump much higher when the company beats their estimates  We re not seeing this impact because the market has already priced in these positive earnings as illustrated by the S P 500 s premium valuation  The forward P E ratio for the S P 500 currently stands at 17 9x  This is well above its 5 year average of 15 6x and its 10 year average of 14 1x 
However  there has been a silver lining among these earnings announcements 
Semiconductor Stocks Outperforming
The Information Technology  IT  sector has been a clear leader this earnings season with 91  of companies reporting earnings above estimates  Furthermore  these companies are beating their expected earnings on average of 11 3   This sector is on pace to achieve 14 8  year over year  YoY  growth 
More specifically  companies in the Semiconductor   Semiconductor Equipment industry have significantly outperformed reporting 42  YoY earnings growth thus far  factset   Other IT industries such as Software  IT Services  and Internet Software   Services have also reported healthy earnings growth of 12   11   and 10   respectively 
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is constantly facing booms and busts as demand for its products quickly changes  However  it is worth taking a closer look at stocks in this industry when times are good as they currently are  iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  NASDAQ SOXX  is up 40  since the beginning of the year and nearly 10  in the last month 
Therefore I was curious to see if there were still any companies that have  1  exposure to the semiconductor industry   2  have yet to report earnings  and  3  are still trading at a fairly reasonable valuation implying that there s still upside potential 
Screening For Semiconductor Stocks With Low Valuations
According to finbox io  the forward P E multiple for the entire IT sector currently stands at 21 4x  well above the 17 9x of the S P 500  This is not surprising as premium growth warrants a premium valuation  Therefore I use the 21 4x multiple as a ceiling in my screen The following are all the filters applied in this semiconductor stock screen 
Company s Description contains  Semiconductor  
Days to next earnings is within 15 days 
Sector is Information Technology 
Forward P E ratio is less than 21 4x  and

source  finbox ioSkyworks is expected to report earnings on Monday  November 6th after markets close and analysts are expecting the company s bottom line to grow by 17 4   CapitalIQ

The company s forward P E multiple of 17 5x is below all of its selected comparable public companies  Semtech s  NASDAQ SMTC  20 5x  Cavium s  NASDAQ CAVM  23 0x  Analog Devices   NASDAQ ADI  20 6x  and Comtech Telecommunications   NASDAQ CMTL  31 1x 

source  finbox ioUnlike the other semiconductor names on this list  MACOM s stock is actually down  13  year to date and  10  over the last month  The majority of these losses are a result of the company s disappointing Q2 17 earnings announcement  Shares fell 25  after management reported net profit that grew 57  but missed analyst estimates by 3 6  according to CapitalIQ

With positioning at extremes  and leverage at extremes  and valuations at extremes  Deutsche Bank s Binky Chadha raises the red flag as the correlation across asset classes soars to record highs signaling extreme contagion risk    
Very strong momentum across asset classes has seen Crude Oil up  the dollar down  equities and bond yields up  with the average correlation between them rising to 90

UST breaks down beneath the Cycle Bottom Support 

The 10 Year Treasury Note Index plunged through its Cycle Bottom support  leaving no visible support at hand  A Master Cycle low may have been made last week  but is only seen as a hesitation in the decline  If so  UST may not see another bounce until late February 
The 10 year Treasury yield jumped to a four year high after a better than expected jobs report reflected rising wages      Yields also got a boost from higher than expected consumer confidence numbers as investors began to bet on accelerating inflation from this growing economy 
The US Labor Department reported Friday that the US economy added 200 000 jobs in January  topping economist expectations of 180 000 jobs added  Average hourly earnings posted a 0 3 percent gain for the month and an annualized gain of 2 9 percent  the best gain since the early days of the recovery in 2009

European equities closed lower on Friday afternoon as investors digested further earnings reports    
The pan European Stoxx 600 closed Friday provisionally 1 38 percent lower with every sector trading in negative territory  The index recorded its biggest weekly loss since November 2016 mainly driven by banking stocks and higher yields

A double barreled blast of bond buying by the Bank of Japan did little to weaken the yen on Friday  as the test of wills continues between the central bank and the investors who suspect it is readying to retreat on massive monetary easing  Nikkei Asian Review  
Market watchers were surprised by the timing of Friday s fixed rate purchasing operation  in which the BOJ names a yield and offers to buy an unlimited amount of Japanese government debt at that level  Since its introduction in 2016  this has been regarded as the bank s ultimate weapon for keeping the Japan 10 Year at its target of around zero

USD consolidated without reaching its  Point 6  target at 88 20  The fact is  the Cycles Model calls for a probable continuation of the decline to the week of February 5 with a likely overshoot of its goal  Having said that reaching the target may be reason enough to take downside profits  As Sir John Templeton once said   I like leaving a little on the table for the next guy  
The greenback slid further Thursday after the Trump administration was seen as stepping back from the strong dollar policy that has been in place since the 1990s  CNBC  
The dollar index was slightly lower  after falling sharply Wednesday on the initial comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that a weak dollar was good for US trade  But when given the opportunity to clarify his comments at the World Economic Forum early Thursday  Mnuchin did not latch on to the strong US  dollar rhetoric used by past Treasury secretaries 
Gold has an inside week 


Gold consolidated under last week s close  but did not make a new low  Gold is still very extended and may not give a tradable signal until it declined beneath Short term support at 1308 19  However this action suggests the end of a trend 
Gold may be heading for the biggest weekly loss since December  but bulls are keeping the faith  confident that the dollar s biggest advance in more than a year won t last  Bloomberg  
The greenback jumped as much as 1 percent after stronger than expected US jobs data bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates  Gold dropped after the report  While higher rates dampen the appeal of non interest bearing bullion  Tai Wong  the New York based head of base and precious metals trading at BMO Capital Markets  is skeptical the greenback s gains will hold

   Hi tech shares lifted by Apple s strong earnings
   Resource stocks rally on commodities advances

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO  April 21  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei climbed for a
second straight session on Thursday  helped by robust U S 
earnings including expectation smashing results from Apple Inc
  	
 The upward move  however  was limited with volumes staying
thin as investors are reluctant to make big bets before Canon
Inc and construction machinery maker Komatsu Ltd
 report next week 	
 Apple s results  which has been under scrutiny for clues
about how severely Japan s March 11 earthquake  tsunami and
nuclear crisis were affecting global supply chains  follow
strong forecasts from Intel Corp  	
  Adding to the positive sentiment  top manufacturers United
Technologies Corp and Eaton Corp raised their
full year earnings forecasts  saying that they were becoming
more confident in the U S  economy s direction 	
   The market is looking for clues about the damage from the
quake in U S  earnings  but it s hard to draw any conclusions as
both Apple and Intel have very diversified supply chains   said
Koichi Ogawa  chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments 	
 Ogawa added that the market will probably move in line with
Wall Street for the rest of the week  but could turn volatile
once Japanese companies report       	
  He said he will focus on energy related companies such as
Mitsubishi Heavy   which is involved in gas turbine
business  that can benefit from possible changes to Japan s
energy policy after the nuclear crisis is resolved 	
 By midmorning the benchmark Nikkei average rose 0 5
percent to 9 654 21  while the broader Topix gained 0 2
percent to 838 80 	
 Tokyo stocks have recouped about two thirds of their losses
from the immediate aftermath of the devastating March 11
earthquake  but trade has turned more volatile and thinned out
ahead of earnings reports 	
 Shares of manufacturers that had underperformed since the
quake such as high tech and precision machinery makers posted
strong gains  with Kyocera Corp gaining 1 6 percent to
8 510 yen and camera maker Nikon Corp gaining 1 5
percent to 1 661 yen 	
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 0 8 percent to
377 yen  underperforming the overall market after sources said 
a Japanese securities joint venture of the banking group and
Morgan Stanley will book a net loss of about 140 billion yen
  1 7 billion  for the year ended in March due mainly to massive
bond trading losses   	
The company is also planning to raise 30 billion yen   363  
million  to shore up its capital  a source with knowledge of the
 matter said   ID nL3E7FK344 	
 Trading houses  miners and other commodity shares continued
to shine  with Japan s biggest gas and oil developer Inpex Corp
  up 3 3 percent after Brent oil jumped 2 percent to
near  124 a barrel on Wednesday 	
 Boosted by positive reports also from F5 Networks Inc
 and United Technologies  the Nasdaq posted its largest
daily percentage gain since October while the Dow hit its
highest close since early June 2008 	
 Trading house Itochu gained 1 6 percent to 818 yen
after the Nikkei business daily reported that it will take a 25
percent stake in an investment unit belonging to China s Citic
Group  opening up opportunities in consumer finance services and
matchmaking deals

   Shippers biggest losers  Baltic Dry Index down for 4th day
   Exporters hurt as yen near 4 mth highs vs dollar
   Foreigners seen cutting futures longs before long weekend

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  July 14  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average fell 
dipping briefly below a major support on Thursday after Moody s
said it may cut the United States  triple A credit rating 
sending the dollar near four month lows and pressuring
exporters 	
 Mounting concerns about U S  debt coming on top of euro zone
woes are likely to prompt foreign players to trim long positions
in Nikkei futures ahead of a long weekend in Japan and will also
likely mean that Tokyo stocks will continue to struggle going
into the earnings season  analysts said 	
 Those long positions were built in a rally since mid June 
with the Nikkei last week hitting its highest since the March 11
earthquake above 10 200 before a dismal U S jobs report hurt
sentiment  	
  Moody s move still hasn t been priced in by the markets  so
we re seeing the Nikkei tracking losses sustained by S P futures
after the Wall Street close   said Nagayuki Yamagishi  an
investment analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities 	
  Debt ceiling problems are likely to be solved right before
the deadline  so financial markets  still jittery about euro
zone debt woes are facing an uncertain couple of weeks   he
said 	
 The benchmark Nikkei lost 0 5 percent to
9 909 80  after falling at one stage to as low as 9 884 00 
beneath support at its 200 day moving average at 9 900 	
 The broader Topix shed 0 5 percent to
855 97 	
 After Moody s move  the greenback dived towards 78 50 yen
   and remained under pressure in morning Asia trade  at
one point hitting a four month low at 78 45 yen  putting
exporters under pressure 	
 Sony Corp lost 1 5 percent to 2 116 yen  while
electronics parts maker Kyocera Corp dropped 1 3
percent to 8 170 yen 	
  We re likely to have a mixed day with the dollar yen rate
dictating the mood   said Takashi Hiroki  chief strategist at
Monex Securities 	
  A higher yen will probably sour sentiment and keep
exporters under pressure  but hopes for more easing will limit
any bigger losses  	
 Moody s cited rising prospects that the  14 3 trillion U S 
debt ceiling may not be raised by an Aug  2nd deadline  Failure
to increase the country s borrowing limit by then could result
in a U S  default that would roil financial
markets   	
 Shippers dropped the most among the 33 Topix
subindexes after the Baltic Dry Index   which tracks
rates to ship dry commodities  fell for a fourth
session  	
 Nippon Yusen was down 2 0 percent at 294 yen and
its biggest rival  Mitsui O S K  Lines lost 1 4 percent
to 421 yen 	
 But shares of Toyota Auto Body soared 8 9 percent
to 1 476 yen and Kanto Auto Works jumped 3 8 percent to
824 yen on Thursday after Toyota Motor Corp announced a
 1 3 billion overhaul of its manufacturing in northeastern
Japan  including the purchase of the two units  	
  Stainless steel maker Nippon Metal Industry jumped
11 percent to 103 yen and Nisshin Steel rose 2 6
percent to 158 yen after industry journal Japan Metal Bulletin
reported that the two companies are in the final talks to merge
their operations and are close to announcing the deal

26 percent of its value last week  staging what market players

During the two weeks from Oct  5 the Nikkei rose more than 5
percent on better than expected results from firms like JPMorgan
Chase   Co 
 The broader Topix lost 0 7 percent to 894 59 
 U S  stocks fell on Friday after disappointing results from
General Electric Co and Bank of America Corp demonstrated the
road to economic recovery will be bumpy 
 Additional pressure came from a report showing that U S 
consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in October  tempering
optimism inspired by news of a rise in industrial production in
September and reinforcing views that the U S  economic recovery
still faces some large hurdles 
 Investors are waiting for earnings results from both the
United States and Japan  and while there s no real reason to
believe these will be bad    especially in Japan  where some
companies have been revising their forecasts upwards    nobody
really wants to buy before then   Okasan s Hirakawa said

 Sony Corp  which climbed on Friday after a brokerage upgrade

including copper  fell on Friday   Itochu lost 3 1 percent to 600
yen  Marubeni Corp lost 2 6 percent to 458 yen and Mitsubishi
Corp lost 1 7 percent to 1 952 yen 
 JAL rose to 110 yen  though market players warned these gains
might well be temporary in the face of the company s challenges 
   There s a lot of problems such as the cost cuts that are
being demanded in areas such as pay and pensions  and since this
doesn t just affect current JAL employees but its pensioners  the
issues have deep roots and will take quite a long time to
resolve   said Nagayuki Yamagishi  a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities 
 Asahi Kasei Corp rose 2 2 percent to 468 yen after the
chemical and housing maker said it is likely to report first half
operating profit 3 2 times higher than its previous forecast 
buoyed by recovery in demand for plastic materials and cost
cutting in its housing business 
 But Casio Computer Co shares fell 7 4 percent to 704 yen
after it lowered its annual outlook to an operating loss of 5
billion yen   55 million  from its previous forecast for a 15
billion yen profit 
 Casio cited a bigger than expected fall in sales of its
mobile phones and digital cameras

TOKYO  Oct 13  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average edged up 0 6
percent on Tuesday  buoyed by exporters such as Honda Motor Corp
after the S P 500 posted a sixth straight day of rises  but
stalled ahead of key U S  and Japanese earnings 
JFE Holdings and other steel shares climbed after Goldman
Sachs hiked its ratings on the companies and upgraded its
coverage views on the steel sector in Asia to  attractive  from
 neutral   saying demand for steel is likely to rise in 2010 
  But trade was lacklustre ahead of corporate earnings reports
in the United States and Japan  with major companies including
Intel Corp due to report earnings later in the day 
   Though a lot of investors held back during the morning out
of a wish to wait for Intel s results  it seems now that some
buying is emerging simply on expectations   said Takashi Ushio 
head of the investment strategy division at Marusan Securities 
 On top of indicators being good  there s hopes that the
July September results will prove better than thought  prompting
buying    much as happened this summer when markets rallied on
expectations  
 Others said views that a recent rise in the yen might be
coming to an end helped underpin the market  The dollar edged up
to around 89 90 yen 
 Many Japanese exporters have set their exchange rate
assumptions for the dollar at around 90 95 yen for the financial
year to March  with any yen advances raising worries about the
negative impact on earnings 
 The benchmark Nikkei gained 60 17 points to 10 076 56  while
the broader Topix rose 0 4 percent to 901 40  Tokyo markets were
closed Monday for a holiday 
Intel s earnings were being keenly watched due both to its
benchmark status and for clues to the health of the U S  economy 
market players said 
  When Intel reports earnings  its outlook will likely be
particularly in focus  If chip makers were to say they expect
demand to increase  that would mean the economy is on the mend  
said Mitsuo Shimizu  deputy general manager at Cosmo Securities 
 But others said the positive impact of even strong earnings
was likely to be limited in Japan 
  Good results from Intel could potentially boost shares in
companies such as TDK and Kyocera  but Japanese companies are
also likely to face pressure from a stronger yen   said Masayoshi
Okamoto  head of dealing at Jujiya Securities 
  Though there s likely to be a knee jerk positive reaction
right after the results come out  the longer term fundamentals in
Japan are quite different  
 EXPORTERS GAIN
 Market players said the Nikkei would also need some fresh
positive factors in order to break above its 25 day moving
average  currently around 10 125 
 But exporters gained a boost after the S P 500 managed a
sixth consecutive day of gains on Monday to end at its closing
high for the year as energy shares rose along with the price of
oil 
Honda rose 2 2 percent to 2 810 yen  while Advantest Corp

    JAL surges after government says it is ready to support it
    Banking sub index hits lowest since mid March
 TOKYO  Oct 1  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average hit its
lowest point in two months on Thursday  with shares of exporters
hurt by a stronger yen  while uncertainty about the policies of
the country s new government dampened investor confidence 
 Banking shares  including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 
lost ground on a string of events including financial services
minister Shizuka Kamei s interest in introducing a moratorium on
the repayment of the principal on mortgages and bank loans to
help small and midsize businesses 
  What the market hates the most is uncertainty  We have no
clear idea about the direction of the new government s policies 
So far  there s no policy ideas that are positive for stocks 
with a cut in public spending and the loan moratorium having a
negative impact   said Masaru Hamasaki  senior strategist at
Toyota Asset Management 
  The Nikkei could even break below 9 000 if the recovery
scenario that investors expect for the second half were to fall
apart  exacerbated by the stronger yen  
 The benchmark Nikkei began the second half of Japan s fiscal
year on a weak note  sliding 1 6 percent to 9 974 45  after
briefly touching 9 965 06  its lowest since July 24 
 The broader Topix fell 1 5 percent to 895 92 
 Market players also said Tokyo shares were likely lifted the
previous day on window dressing buying at the end of Japan s
fiscal half year  and that their weakness may be partly due to
such buying has dissipating 
 Little impact was seen from the Bank of Japan s closely
watched tankan survey  which showed that Japanese business
confidence improved as expected in the three months to September 
 U S  stocks fell on Wednesday after a surprising contraction
in an index of Midwest business activity  but buying of
technology bellwethers like Cisco Systems Inc at the end of a
strong quarter limited losses 
 A focal point in the near term will be forthcoming U S 
economic indicators including jobs data on Friday  as well as
fluctuations in the yen 
 BANKS SLIDE  YEN WEIGHS
 The yen stood around 89 90 yen to the dollar on Thursday 
after hitting an eight month high against the greenback of 88 23
yen on trading platform EBS on Monday 
 Investors fret about a stronger yen as it eats into
exporters  profits when they are repatriated  and many Japanese
exporters have set their exchange rate assumptions for the dollar
around 90 95 yen for the current fiscal year to March 
 Chip tester maker Advantest tumbled 5 8 percent to 2 345 yen
and Canon Inc lost 3 percent to 3 520 yen  Kyocera Corp slid 2 5
percent to 8 120 yen 
  While the dollar rose above 90 yen the other day  it looks
as if the trend for yen strength might still be in place   said
Hiroaki Osakabe  a fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management 
 The banking sector sub index fell to as low as 138 37  its
lowest since mid March 
 In addition to policy risk  plans announced last week by
Nomura Holdings to issue up to  5 6 billion in shares  have
underscored worries that banks might also come out with big share
offerings in the face of a global regulatory push for banks to
carry bigger capital buffers 
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  Japan s top bank  dropped 5
percent to 458 yen  Mizuho Financial Group slipped 2 3 percent to
174 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group shed 3 2 percent to
3 030 yen 
 Bucking the trend was Japan Airlines Corp  which climbed
after Japan s prime minister and transport minister said on
Wednesday the government was ready to support it  aiming to
dispel worries over the viability of the loss making carrier 
 Japan Airlines climbed 4 6 percent to 138 yen

 TOKYO  Oct 2  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average hit a two 
month low on Friday on worries that the U S  economy s nascent
recovery may be losing momentum and as a rise in the yen hit
exporters such as Tokyo Electron 
 The sell off was accompanied by a mild pick up in volume 
with 1 1 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange s
first section  up from last week s morning average of 1 0
billion 
 Construction related firms such as general contractor Kumagai
Gumi fell on ongoing worries that public works projects could be
halted under the new government led by the Democratic Party 
which has pledged to cut wasteful spending 
  The Nikkei s fall is mostly related to the moves in the
United States  but there are also some additional negative
factors specific to Japan   said Masayoshi Okamoto  head of
dealing at Jujiya Securities 
  There are three issues  worries about the Democratic Party
administration s policies  concerns that equity financing by
banks may increase  and worries about yen strength   he said 
 Given such factors  the Nikkei could fall close to 9 000
later this month  Okamoto said  That would be near its July
trough of 9 050 33 
 The Nikkei was down 2 5 percent at 9 733 42 by the midday
break after falling as low as 9 729 14  its lowest since July 23 
 The broader Topix dropped 2 5 percent to 873 46 
 Banking shares  including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 
stayed under pressure on concerns Japan may introduce a
moratorium on the repayment of the principal on mortgages and
bank loans to help small and midsize businesses 
 Worries that financial institutions might issue shares in the
face of a global regulatory push for banks to carry bigger
capital buffers  have also helped drag banking shares lower 
 The banking sub index extended its recent decline and hit a
6     month low of 135 61  while Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
fell 2 percent to 447 yen  Mizuho Financial Group bucked the
trend  edging up 0 6 percent to 176 yen 
 The Dow and S P 500 suffered their worst one day fall in
three months on Thursday after economic reports fuelled fears
about the recovery s strength 
 The U S  indicators released on Thursday were mixed  While
U S  consumer spending rose at its fastest in nearly eight years
in August  data on jobless claims was worse than expected and a
reading on manufacturing activity came in below forecasts 
 The U S  Institute for Supply Management s index of national
factory activity fell in September from August s reading  and
although the latest reading still indicated growth  it was below
economists  forecast in a Reuters poll 
  For the last six months or so  the economy s recovery has
had some momentum but you are starting to see that taper off  
said Kiyoshi Noda  chief fund manager for MU Investments 
 The yen s rise to a 2     month peak against the euro was
likely another factor weighing on Tokyo shares  Noda said 
 Shares of exporters such as carmakers and electrical
machinery makers that have done well over the course of a stock
market rally this year may be seeing some profit taking because
of that  he said 
 Among exporters  Kyocera fell 2 7 percent to 7 910 yen  and
Tokyo Electron fell 4 1 percent to 5 330 yen 
 The euro fell to as low as 129 65 yen on trading platform EBS
on Friday  the euro s lowest against the yen since mid July 
 The dollar stood at 89 42 yen on Friday  down 0 2 percent

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  Oct 5  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei share average edged
up 0 2 percent on Monday on gains in bank shares and retailers
after touching a 10 week low on concern over the fragility of the
U S  economic recovery 
 A surge in shares of Fast Retailing  which said on Friday
that same store sales at its Uniqlo casual clothing chain in
Japan in September jumped 31 6 percent from a year earlier 
helped pull the Nikkei into positive territory 
 Advances in banking shares also lifted the market  Shares in
lenders have recently been battered by worries that lenders may
come out with share offerings in the face of a global regulatory
push for banks to carry bigger capital buffers 
 But exporters such as Kyocera and Honda Motor retreated on
lingering concern that the yen s recent strength may eat into
their overseas profits  while construction firms extended their
losses after falling in the past few weeks 
  While the  U S  jobs  data was bad and optimism about the
U S  economy may have receded  I do not think market players
think that this means that the outlook for the U S  economy is
ruined   said Hideyuki Ishiguro  supervisor at Okasan Securities 
investment strategy department 
  I think it just means market sentiment has returned to
neutral for the time being   Ishiguro added 
 The Nikkei was up 17 55 points or 0 2 percent at 9 749 42 
after falling as low as 9 713 92  its lowest since July 23 
 The broader Topix fell 0 1 percent to 873 44 
 The Nikkei fell 5 2 percent last week  its worst weekly loss
in about three months  It has fallen below trendline support
drawn from its March trough near 7 021 and through its July low
near 9 050  and on Friday the benchmark index dropped below the
bottom of the cloud on daily Ichimoku charts 
 Some analysts say the next downside target may be 9 500  with
a break below that opening the way for a drop towards its July
low of 9 050 
 Fast Retailing climbed 12 8 percent 13 290 yen after it
reported the huge jump in sales in September  helped by the onset
of cold weather and by a five day weekend  The retailer subindex
added 1 5 percent 
 Top bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group climbed 3 2 percent
to 459 yen  while the banking sector subindex climbed 1 5
percent 
 Among exporters  Kyocera fell 1 percent to 7 770 yen  Nikon
dropped 4 5 percent to 1 481 yen and Honda Motor dipped 1 3

 TOKYO  Oct 6  Reuters    The Nikkei share average was flat on
Tuesday  with banking shares such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group gaining after their U S  peers rallied following a Goldman
Sachs upgrade on the bank sector 
 But Fast Retailing slid 3 1 percent  weighing on the market a
day after leaping 15 percent on news that same store sales at its
Uniqlo casual clothing chain in Japan jumped 32 percent in
September 
 Market players said they were worried about the impact of the
recent strength of the yen on exporters  earnings  dampening
investor confidence and capping gains in the overall market 
  Although gains are still due to short covering  Goldman s
upward revisions for bank earnings forecasts in the United States
are helping bank shares here higher   said Takahiko Murai 
general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities 
  But recent strength in the yen is keeping investors from
actively buying on dips as the strong yen could force exporters
to lower their earnings forecasts for the second half of the
business year  
 The benchmark Nikkei added half a point to 9 675 00  It fell
0 6 percent the previous day to book its lowest finish since July

shed 5 2 percent  its worst weekly loss in about three months 
 The broader Topix inched up 0 1 percent to 868 01

 U S  financial stocks rallied on Monday  and were the top

large cap bank sector  saying share prices for companies in the
industry didn t reflect their earnings power 
 Japan s top bank Mitsubishi UFJ climbed 2 percent to 464 yen
and Mizuho Financial Group added 1 7 percent to 182 yen 
 High tech exporters also gained after optimism about upcoming

 TOKYO  Oct 1  Reuters    Asian shares fell on Thursday
after negative news on U S  jobs and manufacturing pointed to a
patchy recovery in the world s largest economy  and as dollar
weakness sparked concerns for exporters around the region 
 In Europe  futures pointed to a flat open for shares at the
start of the final quarter of 2009  after posting their biggest

months 
 The MSCI index of Asian shares excluding Japan

 By Eric Burroughs
 HONG KONG  Sept 28  Reuters    The yen surged to an
eight month high against the dollar on Monday as Japanese
officials waved off any plans to stem the currency s rise 
driving the Nikkei down 2 5 percent and sparking a broad
retreat from riskier assets 
 The yen later gave up some gains as Finance Minister
Hirohisa Fujii changed gears on his comments during the course
of the day  saying yen gains were becoming one sided just hours
after saying the rise was  not abnormal  
  European shares looked set for a third straight session of
losses  with futures on the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 down 0 3
percent 
 Other Asian equity markets also retreated  but losses were
smaller than those in Japan and portfolio manager selling
before the third quarter wraps up also played a role 
Commodities slid and the dollar got a broad safe haven boost
despite its dip against the Japanese currency 
 While Fujii appeared to tone down his comments  analysts
and traders said the consistent message was that Japan was
taking a hands off approach and is no longer as trigger happy
as it once was on forex market intervention  having spent about
 400 billion selling yen to protect its fragile economic
recovery in 2003 and 2004 
 The yen s jump against the dollar has it poised to make a
run at the 13 year peak of 87 10 struck earlier in the year 
with the rise through levels that Japan s big exporters had
planned for this financial year hitting their shares 
  There is little caution towards the government
intervention at the moment because Japanese authorities say
they are not thinking about taking action   said Hideki
Hayashi  global economist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo 
  In the longer term  the dollar could resume its slide
against the yen if data  such as U S  jobs later this week 
point to a subdued recovery 
 The dollar fell as far as 88 23 yen on trading platform EBS
before trimming losses to 89 33 yen  down 0 3 percent on the
day  The yen staged broad gains  with the euro down 1 percent
at 130 45 yen and sterling shedding 1 2 percent to 141 35 yen
 The Nikkei share average shed 2 5 percent to hit a
two month low and briefly fell below the 10 000 line  Among
exporters  Honda Motors fell nearly 5 percent and electronic
parts maker Kyocera Corp lost 3 4 percent    among the biggest
drags on the index 
 The MSCI benchmark of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 1 2 percent  while the Thomson Reuters index for regional
shares shed 1 3 percent 
 Hong Kong s Hang Seng index fell 1 9 percent  with South
Korea s KOSPI index down 0 9 percent and Taiwan s TAIEX off 0 8
percent 
 Some foreign investors were also pulling funds out of Asian
stock markets before quarter end  partially reversing some of
the heavy buying that has taken place over the past six months
on bets favouring the region s growth prospects 
 Foreign investors were stock sellers for a third
consecutive session in South Korea on Monday 
  Without strong buying by foreign investors  markets are
turning lower  and weaker than expected U S  economic data are
weighing on sentiment   said Choi Seong lak  a market analyst
at SK Securities in Seoul 
 Weaker than expected U S  housing sales and durable goods
orders on Friday pushed the U S  S P 500 index down 0 6 percent
on Friday  S P futures were down 0 2 percent in Asia trade 
 Commodity prices also came under pressure  with investors
shrugging off the outcome of the Group of 20 summit in
Pittsburgh and Iran s saber rattling 
 U S  crude oil shed 43 cents to  65 59 extending last

   Deflation worries likely cap further market gains  analyst
 TOKYO  Sept 29  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 0 9
percent on Tuesday  with exporters such as Kyocera Corp
rebounding after the yen pulled back from an eight month high
against the dollar 
 The dollar recovered to around 90 yen after dropping to as
low as 88 23 yen on Monday after Japan s finance minister stoked
speculation the new government was unlikely to intervene to
weaken its currency  That hit shares of exporters and sent the
Nikkei average to a two month closing low 
 Many exporters have set rate assumptions around 90 95 yen 
  Today s gains are due to a rebound as dollar yen moves have
calmed down a bit  Still  investors are increasingly taking a
wait and see approach as moves in the currency market remain
unstable   said Fumiyuki Nakanishi  manager at SMBC Friend
Securities 
  The rebound is also likely to be limited because of growing
worries about deflation  Deflation is not good for the stock
market as it pressures corporate profits  
 Data showed that Japanese core consumer prices fell a record
2 4 percent in August from a year earlier  as weak final demand
adds to pressure from a slide in oil prices  raising questions
about the Bank of Japan s view that deflation will not warrant
more policy action 
 The benchmark Nikkei gained 88 49 points to 10 098 01  The
index slid 2 5 percent the previous day to end at 10 009 52  its
lowest close since July 24  It also hit a two month intraday low

days 
 The broader Topix added 0 3 percent to 905 60 
 The Standard   Poor s 500 Index gained 1 8 percent on Monday

healthcare sectors fuelled optimism about share values 
 The dollar was trading around 90 20 yen in early Asia trade
as the yen has surrendered gains as Finance Minister Hirohisa
Fujii said it was wrong to see his comments as a license to push
the currency higher 
 Fujii was also quoted by Jiji news as saying currency
intervention was possible under extreme circumstances 
 The impact of a stronger yen on earnings of exporter
companies is a concern for market players as a stronger Japanese
currency eats into exporters  profits when they are repatriated 
 Electronics parts maker Kyocera Corp advanced 2 4 percent to
8 270 yen and industrial robot maker Fanuc Ltd gained 2 8 percent
to 7 990 yen 
 Honda Motor Co added 2 1 percent to 2 730 yen

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  Sept 29  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 0 9
percent on Tuesday  with exporters such as Kyocera Corp
rebounding after the yen pulled back from an eight month high
against the dollar 
 The yen has come down from the previous day s peak after
Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii appeared to backtrack on
comments suggesting he was comfortable with the yen s recent
strength 
 The Nikkei s gains were limited  however  due to lingering
worries about the potential for further yen strength  which
erodes Japanese exporters  overseas profits when they are
repatriated 
  This probably shows that no one thinks this is over  even if
the exchange rate has settled down for now   said Mitsushige
Akino  chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management 
  There seems to be a recognition that we are in a phase of
yen strength where there could be a break above the January high
of 87 10 yen   Akino said  referring to the yen s 13 year peak
against the dollar hit earlier this year 
 If such yen strength persists  the risks of downward
revisions to corporate earnings forecasts will rise  he added 
 Many Japanese exporters have set their exchange rate
assumptions for the dollar around 90 95 yen for the current
fiscal year to March 
 The benchmark Nikkei rose 90 68 points to 10 100 20  The
index slid 2 5 percent the previous day to mark its lowest close
since July 24 
 The broader Topix edged up 0 1 percent to 904 00 
 Trade was light on the Tokyo exchange s first section  with
1 8 billion shares changing hands  below last week s daily
average of 2 2 billion 
 The gains in Tokyo shares were tepid compared with gains in
other markets in the region  The MSCI s broad measure of Asian
equities excluding Japanese shares rose about 2 percent 
  There are some factors specific to Japan  such as what will
happen to the yen s strength from here on   said Tsutomu Yamada 
a market analyst at Kabu com Securities 
 EXPORTERS RISE
 The yen stood at 90 06 yen to the dollar  having pulled back
from the previous day s peak of 88 23 yen  which was the yen s
highest since January 
 The yen dipped on Tuesday after finance minister Fujii said
intervention might be an option if exchange rates make irregular
moves 
 Besides moves in the yen  market players were focusing on
U S  data coming up this week such as the Institute for Supply
Management s manufacturing survey and jobs data 
 In addition  Japanese industrial output data is due on
Wednesday and the Bank of Japan s  tankan  survey of corporate
sentiment will be released on Thursday 
 Among exporters  electronics parts maker Kyocera advanced 2 9
percent to 8 310 yen and industrial robot maker Fanuc Ltd gained
2 8 percent to 7 990 yen 
 Honda Motor Co added 1 1 percent to 2 705 yen 
 Kobe Steel Ltd climbed 5 3 percent to 159 yen after the
Nikkei business daily said the steelmaker would boost production
of copper strip products to 5 000 tonnes a month  restoring
output to a peak hit in the spring of 2008 
 Nonferrous metal manufacturer Dowa Holdings Co Ltd rose 3 8
percent to 547 yen after Mitsubishi UFJ Securities initiated
coverage of the company s shares with a target price of 690 yen 
  We think the company s business strategy    which aims to

 TOKYO  Sept 18  Reuters    Tokyo s Nikkei average fell 0 8

finance firm Aiful Corp said it would ask creditors to push back
repayments  rekindling concerns about the ailing sector 
 Shares in Aiful s main creditors such as Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co and Aozora Bank fell  while recent gainers such as
Advantest Corp lost steam after U S  stocks took a breather
following a rally

added to uncertainty in the sector that already existed about the

 Shizuka Kamei  the new minister for banking and market
regulation  has said he would like to introduce a moratorium on
some loan repayments to help small and midsized businesses and

 The benchmark Nikkei slipped 88 15 points to 10 355 65  after
gaining 1 7 percent the previous day to hit a one week closing
high 
 The broader Topix fell 0 9 percent to 931 42 
 Trade was also cautious ahead of a five day holiday from
Sept  19 23 in Japan  market players said 
 Aiful was untraded due to a glut of sell orders at 134 yen 
down 27 2 percent from Thursday s close 
 Aiful said it would ask creditors to push back repayments on
about  3 billion in debt as it faces difficulty raising funds and
plans for more restructuring 
 Shares of Sumitomo Trust and Banking shed 4 2 percent to 457
yen  while Aozora Bank tumbled 5 9 percent to 127 yen 
 The other financial subindex  which lost 5 8 percent  and

 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Sept 18  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average
slipped 0 7 percent on Friday  with financials hit after consumer
finance firm Aiful Corp said it was asking for debt repayments to
be rescheduled 
 But large banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group turned
positive in later trade  buoyed by short covering after sliding
all week on worries about financial policy under Japan s new
government and ahead of public holidays next week 
 The new government s minister for banking  Shizuka Kamei 
said this week he would like to introduce a moratorium on some
loan repayments to help small and midsized businesses and
individuals struggling from the economic downturn  sending bank
shares lower 
 But comments from Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on Friday
that hinted at scepticism about such a plan helped investors take
heart  market players said 
  Bank shares were really hit by political risk this week 
after those comments by Kamei  and what we saw today was a bit of
position adjustment ahead of the weekend  helped out by the
finance minister   said Masayoshi Okamoto  head of dealing at
Jujiya Securities

 Rival lenders fell sharply  though some managed to pare
losses by the close 
 Takefuji Corp lost 9 5 percent and Promise Co Ltd  fell 0 8
percent to 599 yen 
 Shares in Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co  one of Aiful s main
creditors  edged up 0 2 percent to 478 yen  though those of

   Tokyo market reopens after five day weekend
 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Sept 24  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average
jumped 1 7 percent on Thursday  with exporters such as Honda
Motor Co rising after Federal Reserve statements that U S 
economic activity was picking up outweighed fears about a
stimulus withdrawal by the Fed 
 Active short covering after the benchmark lost 0 7 percent
last week also boosted shares across the board  analysts said 
 But Japan Airlines tumbled 11 1 percent after sources said
the company might be broken up and public broadcaster NHK
reported it is planning to seek a taxpayer funded bailout to
overhaul its operations 
 Consumer lender Aiful plunged 11 2 percent after it said on
Thursday it would halve its workforce and slash branch numbers as
it warned of a  3 4 billion loss for the year to March 2010 
 Though U S  shares had originally risen sharply on Fed
comments that economic activity was picking up  they reversed
course in the last hour of trade on worries about the timing of
the removal of some of the Fed s stimulus 
 But analysts said Tokyo was taking the more optimistic
stance 
  More than worries about the removal of any stimulus  I think
the market is really starting to get a sense that things are
improving    this is why certain manufacturers that had fallen
behind a bit are strong today   said Nagayuki Yamagishi  a
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities 
  Basically  though  the Fed s comments do seem to be pointing
the way to the exit  
 The Fed s policy setters met and kept interest rates
unchanged  as expected  but they also said the U S  central bank
would slow purchases of mortgage debt to extend the programme s
life until the end of March    a move seen as a step towards a
measured withdrawal of its extraordinary support for the economy
during the downturn 
 Yamagishi noted that while purchases of mortgage debt might
be slowing  they would still continue until March 
 Other market players agreed the Fed statement was being taken
more positively than otherwise  with Wall Street s Wednesday fall
likely being little more than profit taking 
  Wall Street had already factored in a lot of good economic
indicators over the past month  that s why the positive comments
didn t help   said Hiroaki Osakabe  a fund manager at Chibagin
Asset Management 
  What we saw yesterday was really just profit taking  
 The benchmark Nikkei rose 177 88 points to 10 548 42  while
the broader Topix rose 1 4 percent to 952 37 
 With the Nikkei beginning trade on Thursday above a
short term downtrend line  the technical picture is also becoming
somewhat brighter  Osakabe added 
 The benchmark also broke well above its 25 day moving
average  which currently comes in around 10 400 
 JAL  AIFUL TUMBLE
 JAL fell to 152 yen  Earlier this week  two sources familiar
with the matter said lenders to JAL may seek to split the carrier
between its profitable and loss making parts 
 Aiful  which last week asked creditors to let it to push back
repayments on  3 billion in debt  said it plans to cut about
2 000 jobs  or about 49 percent of the group s total workforce 
by February 
 It tumbled to 119 yen 
 But exporters fared better  rising on optimism about the U S 
economic recovery 
 Honda advanced 1 9 percent to 2 885 yen  while Kyocera Corp
climbed 3 3 percent to 8 350 yen and Tokyo Electron Ltd jumped
4 8 percent to 5 850 yen 
 Sony Corp gained 3 3 percent to 2 675 yen  A Sony executive
said on Wednesday that sales of the PlayStation 3 video game
console jumped in the weeks after a  100 price cut last month 
and strong demand could lead to empty shelves at retailers 
 Daiichi Sankyo climbed 1 7 percent to 1 912 yen after its top
executives on Wednesday predicted the company s Benicar
blood pressure drugs would post modest sales gains even after
Merck   Co s rival Cozaar and Novartis AG s market leading Diovan
begin facing generic competition

 TOKYO  Sept 24  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 1 2
percent on Thursday  lifted by exporters such as Kyocera Corp as
investors played catch up after returning from a string of public
holidays 
 Fast Retailing Co jumped after Goldman Sachs raised its
rating on the stock to  buy  from  neutral   saying concerns
about fall and winter sales are unwarranted and citing the
earnings potential of its operations in Asia

 Aiful shares plunged 17 2 percent after the lender said it

of a  3 4 billion loss for the year to March 2010 
  Gains are due to a catch up in the market led by
short covering in stocks futures   said Mitsushige Akino  chief
fund manager at Ichiyoshi investment Management 
  Japanese stocks couldn t keep up with gains in U S  stocks 
particularly before the holiday here  on concerns about a
stronger yen  Now that the holiday is over and Wall Street didn t
fall significantly during that time  investors are picking up
stocks  
 The benchmark Nikkei gained 122 95 points to 10 493 49  after
earlier rising to 10 566 98  its highest level in about four
weeks 
 The Nikkei dipped 0 7 percent last week 
 The broader Topix added 0 8 percent to 946 55 
 U S  stocks fell on Wednesday  dented by profit taking and as
investors worried the Federal Reserve is closer to pulling back

  JAL would have to come up with really drastic restructuring
to convince lenders or the government  but even if they do so 
the market would doubt whether such measures could really be

 By Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO  Sept 28  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell below
the 10 000 mark to its weakest level in two months on Monday  as
a sharply stronger yen hit shares of exporters such as Honda
Motor and after disappointing housing data fuelled worries about
the strength of a U S  recovery 
 The U S  dollar slid to an eight month low of 88 23 yen in
early Asian trade on Monday  as investors unwound short yen
positions and as expectations that Japan will intervene at these
levels receded 
 Market players said the stronger yen is putting heavy
pressure on the exporter heavy Nikkei  as it eats into exporters 
overseas profits when they are repatriated 
  Many exporters have set their currency rate assumption at
90 95 yen  and if the dlr yen were to stay below 90 yen  the
impact on their earnings would be huge and that s a concern  
said Yutaka Miura  senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities 
 In moderate trade  the benchmark Nikkei touched 9 989 65 
breaking below 10 000 for the first time since July 24 before
rising back to 10 023 99  down 2 4 percent 
 The index extended a 2 6 percent fall it booked on Friday 
 The broader Topix shed 2 3 percent to 901 72 
 In a holiday shortened week  the Nikkei slipped 1 percent

of the year 
  We also have growing scepticism about the sustainability of
the economic recovery  Economic indicators have improved but many

eight month high against the dollar on Monday as Japanese
officials waved off any plans to stem the currency s rise 
driving the Nikkei down 2 5 percent and sparking a broad
retreat from riskier assets 
 The yen later gave up some gains as Finance Minister
Hirohisa Fujii changed gears on his comments during the course
of the day  saying yen gains were becoming one sided just hours
after saying the rise was  not abnormal    ID nT241084 
  European shares looked set for a third straight session of

 Other Asian equity markets also retreated  but losses were
smaller than those in Japan and portfolio manager selling
before the third quarter wraps up also played a role 
Commodities slid and the dollar got a broad safe haven boost
despite its dip against the Japanese currency 
 While Fujii appeared to tone down his comments  analysts
and traders said the consistent message was that Japan was
taking a hands off approach and is no longer as trigger happy
as it once was on forex market intervention  having spent about
 400 billion selling yen to protect its fragile economic
recovery in 2003 and 2004   ID nYEN 
 The yen s jump against the dollar has it poised to make a
run at the 13 year peak of 87 10 struck earlier in the year 
with the rise through levels that Japan s big exporters had
planned for this financial year hitting their shares 
  There is little caution towards the government
intervention at the moment because Japanese authorities say
they are not thinking about taking action   said Hideki
Hayashi  global economist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo

against the yen if data  such as U S  jobs later this week

   Market gains weak on earnings worries due to yen  analyst
 TOKYO  Oct 6  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average inched up 0 2
percent on Tuesday  lifted by banking shares such as Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group after their U S  peers rallied following a
Goldman Sachs upgrade on the bank sector 
 Mazda Motor jumped 6 percent after it said it would raise up
to  1 1 billion in a share sale to invest in hybrid and other
technologies in what analysts said was a long overdue bid to
close the gap with rivals  It also halved its net loss forecast
for the year to March 
 High tech exporters including Tokyo Electron also gained
after optimism about upcoming U S  earnings and strong services
sector data boosted Wall Street 
  Although gains are still due to short covering  Goldman s
upward revisions for bank earnings forecasts in the United States
are helping bank shares here higher   said Takahiko Murai 
general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities 
  But recent strength in the yen is keeping investors from
actively buying on dips as the strong yen could force exporters
to lower their earnings forecasts for the second half of the
business year  
 The benchmark Nikkei rose 21 75 points to 9 696 24  It fell
0 6 percent the previous day to book its lowest finish since July
21 at well below its 25 day moving average  Last week  the index
shed 5 2 percent  its worst weekly loss in about three months 
 The broader Topix added 0 3 percent to 870 07 
 U S  financial stocks rallied  and were the top positive on
the S P 500 index after Goldman Sachs upgraded the large cap bank
sector  saying share prices for companies in the industry didn t
reflect their earnings power 
 Japan s top bank Mitsubishi UFJ climbed 2 4 percent to 466
yen and Mizuho Financial Group added 2 2 percent to 183 yen 
 The yen stood around 89 40 yen to the dollar in early Asia

  Elpida tumbles  but Fast Retailing pares losses
 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Sept 2  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average fell
2 4 percent on Wednesday  with exporters hit by a stronger yen
and financial shares down amid a broad selloff sparked partly by
worries about the health of the U S  financial system 
Elpida Memory plunged 16 percent after Japan s sole maker of
PC memory said it would issue new shares to raise up to  844
million  while retailers lost ground after Seven   I Holdings cut
its annual operating profit forecast 
 Concerns about the U S  financial sector were reignited after
Sanford C  Bernstein Research cut American International Group to
 underperform  from  market perform   and said there was no
reason for shareholders to continue owning the stock  leading it
to plummet on Tuesday and pushing Wall Street lower 
  Wall Street rose fairly strongly on belief that the
financial system was fine  but the recent highs were probably the
limit   said Mitsushige Akino  chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management 
  The question now is whether Wall Street will consolidate at
this level or fall further  The Nikkei will take its cues from
those moves  
 Other market players said the Nikkei  which on Monday hit an
11 month high of 10 767  a level some 53 percent above its March
lows  was ripe for profit taking 
  Certainly indicators in various nations have been improving 
but the fact that markets have been falling despite this suggests
that a bit of downward adjustment may be in the offing   said
Noritsugu Hirakawa  a strategist at Oksasan Securities 
 In a possible sign of this  the Nikkei broke below its 25 day
moving average  which currently comes in around 10 400 and had
been acting as a support for around the last week 
 The benchmark shed 249 60 points to 10 280 46  after falling
as much as 2 9 percent  The broader Topix lost 2 percent to
949 81 
  The fall below the 25 day moving average is probably only
temporary  but does hint at some adjustment   said Hirakawa 
  Still  at this point there s nothing bad enough to take it
below 10 000  which I think will hold for a while  
 STOCK SCEPTICISM
 The S P 500 fell 2 2 percent on Tuesday to 998 04 as
scepticism that stocks can add to a nearly 50 percent rally over
the last six months prevailed in the market 
 The fall came despite data showing the Institute for Supply
Management s  ISM  closely watched barometer of U S  factory
activity jumped to 52 9 from 48 9 in July  the highest level
since June 2007 
 The dollar pared losses to stand flat at 92 87 yen  Earlier 
the Japanese currency had spiked to a seven week high against the
greenback and the euro as renewed fears about the financial
sector made investors cautious about riskier assets 
 Among exporters  Canon Inc lost 2 8 percent to 3 500 yen 
Advantest Corp  a chip tester maker  shed 2 5 percent to 2 310
yen and electronics parts maker Kyocera Corp declined 1 4 percent
to 7 630 yen 
 Elpida tumbled to 1 285 yen after saying it plans to float up
to 55 million new shares  increasing the number of its common
shares by 39 percent  to help it keep pace with technology
advances at South Korean rivals Samsung Electronics and Hynix
Semiconductor 
 While retailers remained weak  Fast Retailing  the operator
of the Uniqlo casual clothing chain  pared losses saying sales
could reach 1 trillion yen   10 8 billion  in the year to August
2010 if it can clinch an acquisition 
 Fast Retailing shed 3 1 percent to 10 500 yen while Seven   I
Holdings  Japan s largest retailer  sank 2 7 percent to 2 170 yen
after it cut its full year operating profit forecast by 12
percent as a cool summer exacerbated weak consumer spending 
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  Japan s largest bank  lost
2 5 percent to 580 yen  while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
shed 2 7 percent to 3 900 yen 
 One of the few bright spots was Yoshimoto Kogyo  one of
Japan s largest talent agencies  which soared 16 percent to 1 251
yen after the Yomiuri daily reported details of a prospective
buyout by a consortium of some 20 companies  echoing a report by
Reuters in July

upward trend   said Junichi Misawa  senior fund manager at STB

 Latest upbeat data included the Conference Board s August
index of consumer confidence that topped economists  forecasts

consecutive month in June  suggesting improvement in two sectors
crucial for a U S  recovery 
  But investors can t aggressively keep pushing the market

 Analysts said domestic investors were reluctant to actively
take positions ahead of the result of Sunday s election  which
many expect Japan s opposition Democratic Party to win  But some
say the election is already a neutral trading factor 
 Opinion polls show the main opposition Democratic Party of
Japan set for a sweeping victory on Sunday that would end more
than 50 years of almost unbroken rule by the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party  LDP  
 A solid win for the Democrats would raise the chances of
clearing a policy deadlock in parliament  where the opposition
controls the upper house 
 Foreign investors have been net buyers of Japanese stocks
each week for the last month or so  and market analysts say their
interest may grow even more if the Democrats win

6159,227674,KYOCY,Nikkei slides on profit taking  off 10 mth peak,news,"  Nikkei retreats 3 1 pct on profit taking
   Falls in oil  China shares cloud outlook for risk assets
   GDP broadly as expected  but disappoints some investors
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  Aug 17  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 3 1
percent on Monday in its biggest one day fall in nearly five
months  on profit taking sparked by worries the surge in stocks
had run ahead of economic recovery 
 An unexpectedly weak reading on U S  consumer confidence and
falls in U S  share prices late last week  as well as declines
in oil prices and Chinese equities  raised worries that risky
assets were due for a pull back 
 Resource linked shares such as Inpex Corp retreated due to
the slide in oil prices  while exporters such as Kyocera Corp
fell as the dollar dipped against the yen and pulled away from
an eight week high hit earlier this month 
  The Nikkei has gained a lift from rises in overseas
equities and an expansion in investors  risk tolerance  But
there is a sense that this is approaching a limit   said
Mitsushige Akino  chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management 
  That s why profit taking is predominant   he added 
 Data showing that Japan s economy grew 0 9 percent in
April June from the previous quarter  broadly in line with a
median market forecast for 1 0 percent growth  also led to some
profit taking as it disappointed those investors who had been
bracing for stronger numbers  market players said 
 The Nikkei slid 328 72 points to 10 268 61  its lowest
closing level in about two weeks  and down from a 10 month
closing high of 10 597 33 on Friday 
The Nikkei s 3 1 percent slide was its biggest one day
percentage fall since late March 
 The broader Topix index fell 2 5 percent to 949 59 
 The fall in Tokyo shares occurred in relatively thin volume 
with 1 97 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange s
first section  just slightly above last week s daily average of
1 94 billion  which was the lowest daily average since 1 78
billion shares in the week of Feb  16 19 
 Bucking the overall trend were flu related shares  Shares of
drugmakers and companies that produce medical masks and the
fabrics used to make them jumped after news of Japan s first
death from the H1N1 flu 
 Daiichi Sankyo climbed 2 9 percent to 1 998 yen  It and
Australian biotech firm Biota said last week a new flu drug 
which was billed as possibly effective against both H1N1 swine
flu and H5N1 bird flu  has succeeded in late stage trials in
Asia 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by nearly 6 to
1 
 EYES ON CHINESE SHARES
 Investors and analysts said the Nikkei was unlikely to fall
too sharply in the near term  as economic fundamentals were
likely to remain solid at least until the July September
quarter 
  We are not in a phase where we are likely to see
disappointing numbers  Instead  there will probably be some
figures that point to a recovery   said Kiyoshi Noda  chief fund
manager for MU Investments 
  But since the market has risen quite a bit  we may see some
volatility  both toward the upside and the downside even while
trading within a range   Noda said 
 Bearish technical signals could add to the selling momentum 
judging from a form of technical analysis known as Moving
Average Convergence Divergence  MACD   The MACD line is now
nearly overlapping with the signal line on daily charts and
close to breaking below it  in what would be a bearish signal 
 The market is vulnerable to quick shifts in sentiment  with
trade led by short term players  said Ichiyoshi s Akino 
  Right now there are only short term players  because it is
hard to tell how corporate earnings and economic sentiment in
the second half of the fiscal year and beyond will turn out  
Akino said  referring to the period from October and beyond 
 A natural correction for the Nikkei would be a drop towards
10 000  but the benchmark index could fall towards 9 500 if
falls in Chinese shares and oil prices gain steam  Akino said 
 Oil and gas developer Inpex slid 4 8 percent to 708 000 yen 
as oil prices fell below  67 a barrel on Monday  extending the
previous session s 4 3 percent decline 
 Kyocera Corp fell 4 1 percent to 7 500 yen 
 Chinese shares extended their fall after the Nikkei s close
and slid 5 8 percent

   Sanyo surges on Toyota battery use report
   Autos  Canon up after brokerage upgrades
 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Aug 19  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average fell
to a three week closing low on Wednesday  hit by late sales in
futures that dragged the cash market down  along with a slide in
Chinese stocks that damaged already shaky investor sentiment 
 High tech exporters such as Kyocera Corp lost ground with
chip linked shares that rose in morning trade  but this was
countered by a surge in Sanyo Electric Co and gains by auto
shares 
 Sanyo soared as much as 17 percent to a near two month high
after a source familiar with the matter said Toyota Motor Corp
would buy batteries for hybrid cars from Sanyo to keep pace with
growing demand for cleaner vehicles 
 Shares in firms that produce medical masks and the fabrics to
make them climbed after a third death from the H1N1 flu in Japan 
  The stock market has progressed upwards very steadily  and
whether this is just a pause or we re entering a correction is
still very hard to read  especially with uncertainty lingering
about Chinese shares   said Takashi Ushio  head of the investment
strategy division at Marusan Securities 
  So this situation all makes it very hard to buy  
 The benchmark Nikkei fell 0 8 percent or 80 96 points to
10 204 00  its lowest close since late July  The broader Topix
shed 0 7 percent to 943 25 
 Analysts said the signals were mixed  making investors wary 
 U S  government data showed construction starts for
single family dwellings  the worst hit part of the housing
market  rose 1 7 percent in July from June to an annual rate of
490 000 dwellings    the highest since October 
 But a 13 3 percent drop in new multifamily home projects
pushed overall housing starts down 1 percent to an annual rate of
581 000 dwellings after two months of gains 
Shares in Shanghai shed 2 6 percent in volatile trade after
falling over 3 percent at one point  increasing investor jitters
after a sharp Monday slide 
  There s a slight bias towards optimism among investors  but
optimists and pessimists are nearly evenly divided  and none of
the optimists are really gung ho   said Masayoshi Okamoto  head
of dealing at Jujiya Securities 
  Nobody s really moving their portfolios    they re either
hedging in futures or in ETFs  exchange traded funds   
 Analysts also said that some investors were wary of active
trade ahead of Japan s August 30 election  The opposition
Democratic Party currently leads Prime Minister Taro Aso s
Liberal Democratic Party in newspaper polls 
  People do seem to be holding back from buying a bit on the
election  But I d say that China s still a bigger uncertainty  
said Hideyuki Ishiguro  a supervisor in the investment advisory
department of Okasan Securities 
 SANYO SURGE
 Sanyo shares were up 10 3 percent at 247 yen  after hitting
their highest since June 29 
 Toyota  the world s biggest automaker  will first use Sanyo s
lithium ion batteries from around 2011  said the source  who
spoke on condition of anonymity 
 Analysts said that while the news is likely to be crucial for
Sanyo s positioning in the rechargeable battery market  the stock
itself was probably now overbought 
  There s a lot of expectation about the company s
rechargeable and solar cell business  but at the current price
it s hard to imagine that any institutional investors would be
buying   said Osamu Hirose  an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research
Center 
 Toyota and other automakers rose after Nomura Securities
raised its investment stance on the sector to  bullish  from
 neutral   although they shed much of their gains by the close 
 Nomura cited improvement in company performance in the first
quarter  hopes for recovery in demand due to government support
measures  and a growing possibility that companies may raise
their forecasts 
 Toyota edged up 0 3 percent to 4 050 yen  Honda Motor Co rose
2 percent to 3 070 yen and Mazda Motor Co gained 1 2 percent to
260 yen 
 Canon climbed 1 2 percent to 3 400 yen after Goldman Sachs
upgraded the company to  buy  from  neutral  and added it to its
conviction list  citing expectations for a strong rebound in
laser beam printer shipments and resilient demand for digital
cameras 
 Japan s health ministry said the H1N1 flu had reached
epidemic proportions in Japan 
 Shikibo shot up 26 percent to 260 yen  Unitika rose 6 8
percent to 94 yen  Daiwabo Holdings gained 6 6 percent to 466 yen
and Fujibo Holdings rose 6 2 percent to 172 yen 
 Trade picked up slightly  with 2 2 billion shares changing
hands  compared with last week s daily average of 1 9 billion 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by more than 2 to

 TOKYO  Aug 21  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average slipped on
Friday  dragged lower by Toyota Motor and slumping auto shares
ahead of the end of a U S  rebate programme  with investors
nervous about moves in Chinese shares 
 Exporters slipped in the wake of mixed U S  economic data 
with a slightly stronger yen also having an impact  High tech
exporters such as Kyocera were hit especially hard 
One bright spot was Japan Airlines Corp  JAL   Asia s biggest
carrier by revenue  which climbed 1 2 percent after saying it
would start talks to merge its ailing air cargo business with a
unit of shipper Nippon Yusen 
 Analysts cautioned that a mixed bag of economic news  with
positive U S  manufacturing data from the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia offsetting disappointment with the second straight
rise in weekly jobless claims  was keeping investors skittish 
  We re seeing a situation where stocks are rising in the
midst of a still tough economic situation   said Kenichi Hirano 
operating officer at Tachibana Securities 
  Stocks are likely to keep on rising  but it will be with
dips along the way  and substantial gains will take time  
 The benchmark Nikkei fell 1 3 percent or 133 10 points to
10 250 31 after rising 1 8 percent the day before  The broader
Topix lost 1 2 percent to 947 22 
 The Shanghai Composite Index opened down but soon edged
higher  gaining 0 4 percent by mid morning 
  Japanese investors are awaiting results of an Aug  30
election amid newspaper predictions  including from the Nikkei
business daily  that the opposition Democratic Party may be
headed for a landslide victory  trouncing the conservative party
that has ruled for most of the past half century 
  The market consensus is that the Democrats will win  and if
they do it by a landslide this will do away with the current
political paralysis and be good for the market   said Hiroaki
Osakabe  a fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management 
 But others said a Democratic win could be negative 
  They  the Democrats  want everything to be equal for
everybody  This is not something a capitalist market can like  
said Masayoshi Okamoto  head of dealing at Jujiya Securities 
  They say they re trying to be realistic but if they win that
many seats they ll basically have a free hand with policies  
 FUJITSU UP  CARS SKID
Fujitsu Ltd gained 2 1 percent to 632 yen after it said it
sold most of its shares in industrial robot maker Fanuc Ltd for
89 billion yen   945 million   and it revised its 6 month net
earnings forecast to a profit from a loss 
 Fujitsu said it sold 11 976 million shares  most of its 5
percent stake in Fanuc  and it revised up its net earnings
forecast to a profit of 15 billion yen on the proceeds of the sale
from a previous forecast for a loss of 55 billion yen 
But automakers lost ground after the U S  government said it
will suspend its popular  cash for clunkers  auto rebates on
Monday as the programme s  3 billion budget runs dry  a month

 Toyota Motor Corp  the world s largest carmaker  slid 2 7
percent to 3 990 yen  while Honda Motor Co shed 3 6 percent to
2 970 yen and Nissan Motor Co lost 4 5 percent to 682 yen 
 The transport equipment subindex fell 2 9 percent to become
the biggest decliner among other subindexes 
  There s no question that Japanese carmakers have a
substantial exposure to the United States    more so than  say 
automakers from Korea   said Yutaka Miura  a senior technical
analyst at Mizuho Securities 
 The dollar dipped 0 3 percent to 93 88 yen  which hit

 TOKYO  Aug 21  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average slipped 1 4
percent on Friday  hurt by the yen s advance against the dollar 
with Toyota Motor and other automakers also skidding on news that
the United States will end a car rebate programme soon 
 Market players said stocks extended losses in the afternoon
due to a stronger yen  which curbs exporters  profits when
repatriated  and weakness in the Hang Seng Index as investors
nervously watch moves in Chinese stocks for cues 
  Uncertainty about the direction of the Chinese stock market
and news of the end of the U S  auto incentive programme are
bringing down the market   said Masaru Hamasaki  a senior
strategist at Toyota Asset Management 
  The news of the end of the programme came as a surprise and
sparked concerns about a drop in sales as a result  That s
negative for auto stocks  
 In moderate trade the benchmark Nikkei shed 145 21 points to
10 238 20  after briefly falling as far as 10 142 22  its lowest
point since July 30  It gave up 3 4 percent on the week 
 The broader Topix slipped 1 2 percent to 947 34 
 The Hang Seng Index slipped nearly 2 percent during Tokyo
trading time  while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0 9
percent  after having logged a 20 percent dive in the two weeks
to Wednesday s close  unnerving investors around the world 
 Investors were also cautious ahead of Japan s national
election on Aug  30 
 Newspapers including the Nikkei business daily are predicting
that the opposition Democratic Party could be headed for a
landslide victory  trouncing the conservative party that has
ruled for most of the past half century 
  A landslide victory by the Democrats has started to sound
more realistic  and that is leading investors to close positions
for now   said Fumiyuki Nakanishi  manager at SMBC Friend
Securities 
 AUTOMAKERS DRAG
 Automakers lost ground after the U S  government said it will
suspend its popular  cash for clunkers  auto rebates on Monday as
the programme s  3 billion budget runs dry  a month after it was
launched 
 The programme has provided a big temporary boost for both the
deeply troubled auto industry and the battered U S  economy 
 Toyota Motor Corp  the world s largest carmaker  slid 2 9
percent to 3 980 yen  while Honda Motor Co dropped 4 1 percent to
2 955 yen and Nissan Motor Co lost 5 2 percent to 677 yen 
 The dollar fell 0 5 percent to 93 71 yen  which hit
exporters 
 Canon Inc declined 1 1 percent to 3 500 yen and Sony Corp
fell 1 4 percent to 2 445 yen  Kyocera slipped 1 percent to 7 320
yen 
 Among stocks that gained  Fujitsu gained 1 percent to 625 yen
after it said it sold most of its shares in industrial robot
maker Fanuc Ltd for 89 billion yen   945 million   and it revised
its 6 month net earnings forecast to a profit from a loss

 By Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO  Aug 24  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average jumped 3 4
percent in thin trade on Monday  boosted by hopes for a global
economic recovery that sent U S  shares climbing  with Canon Inc
and other exporters leading the benchmark higher 
 Oil and gas field developer Inpex and other energy linked
shares advanced as oil prices steadied around  74 a barrel on
Monday  keeping last week s gains of nearly 10 percent on
optimism about a U S  economic recovery 
 The Dow rose to its highest level in nine months on Friday 
boosted by a surprising rise in home sales and comments by
Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke that the global economy is
emerging from a recession 
 But market analysts said that despite the jump on Wall
Street  investors remained cautious due to uncertainty about the
Chinese stock market  whose drop in recent weeks had spooked
investors globally  and Japan s general election on Aug  30 
 Underscoring a cautious mood in the market  turnover volume
on the Tokyo exchange s first section hit its lowest level since
July 28 at 1 3 trillion yen 
  Strong U S  home sales figures are offsetting worries about
the economic outlook that pushed down the U S   Japanese and
Chinese markets last week   said Mitsushige Akino  chief fund
manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management 
  The focus now is whether the Nikkei can shift to the
10 500 11 000 range  But it may find it hard to do that this week
because trading volume is thin and there s the election  
 The benchmark Nikkei gained 342 85 points to 10 581 05 
erasing a 3 4 percent decline it posted last week  It is now
within sight of its 10 month high of 10 630 38 hit on Aug  14 
 The broader Topix rose 2 4 percent to 970 27 
 Market analysts say many expect the opposition Democratic
Party to win the Aug  30 election but investors remain hesitant
about actively take positions before they actually see the
results 
 Public opinion polls show the Democratic Party is likely to
trounce the conservative Liberal Democratic Party that has ruled
for most of the past half century  with some saying it could win
300 seats in Japan s 480 seat lower chamber 
  I would say that most of the market expects an opposition
victory  the question is by how much  Too large a victory    say
well over 300 seats    might make some investors nervous   said
Takashi Ushio  head of the investment strategy division at
Marusan Securities 
  That s because some of the policies in the Democratic
platform  such as pledging sharp cuts in greenhouse gases and
ending hiring of temporary workers  raise fears about damage to
Japanese competitiveness and can t necessarily be said to be good
for business  
 But others say a landslide victory by the Democrats will be
the best scenario for the market as that would mean a strong 
effective government 
 EXPORTERS  OIL STOCKS JUMP
 Exporters were some of the biggest winners after a surprising
7 2 percent jump in July sales of previously owned U S  homes
boosted investor confidence on Wall Street 
 That was enhanced by comments by Bernanke  who said economic
activity in the U S  and abroad appears to be levelling out but
also warned that growth would be sluggish 
 Canon  the world s largest digital camera maker  shot up 6 3
percent to 3 720 yen 
 The company ended at the day s high after the company told
Reuters in an interview that it plans to restructure its
microchip stepper division by December  a move aimed at helping
it better compete with ASML and Nikon Corp 
 Chip tester maker Advantest Corp surged 6 9 percent to 2 415
yen and electronics parts maker Kyocera Corp climbed 5 2 percent
to 7 700 yen 
 Toyota Motor Corp climbed 2 3 percent to 4 070 yen  while
Honda Motor Co advanced 3 2 percent to 3 050 yen 
 The Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday that Honda
plans to develop an electric car to debut in the U S  market by
around 2015 as tighter environmental regulations push demand for
zero emission vehicles 
 Some analysts said carmakers were also getting a boost from
short covering after being beaten sharply lower in Friday trade 
when they led the market lower 
 Oil linked shares rose  Inpex jumped 5 4 percent to 758 000
yen  while Nippon Mining Holdings climbed 2 5 percent to 491 yen
and Nippon Oil advanced 2 3 percent to 542 yen 
 Trading houses  which are major dealers in energy and have
stakes in oil and gas projects  also gained 
 Mitsubishi Corp gained 3 9 percent to 1 914 yen and Mitsui  
Co rose 2 5 percent to 1 255 yen 
 Shares of Yakult Honsha Co soared 9 8 percent to 2 295 yen
after the Nikkei business daily said it could achieve a rise in
operating profit this business year instead of the forecast 10
percent decline  helped by solid overseas sales of its fermented

 TOKYO  Aug 17  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 2 2
percent on Monday  retreating from 10 month highs  with exporters
such as Kyocera hit as the yen rose against the dollar on
concerns about how quickly the U S  economy will recover 
 Japan s economy grew 0 9 percent in April June from the
previous quarter  marking the first expansion in five quarters
and in line with a median market forecast for 1 0 percent growth 
data showed before the start of trade 
 Market players said the Nikkei  which scored a 10 month
closing high on Friday  succumbed to profit taking after the GDP
news  which the market watched closely  ran its course  with the
stronger yen adding to the negative momentum

concern about consumer spending in the United States  is weighing
heavily on the market   said Hiroaki Kuramochi  chief equity

 The broader Topix declined 2 percent to 954 48 
 In early Asian trade the dollar was down 0 3 percent at 94 60
yen  Investors fret about a stronger yen as it curbs exporters 
profits when they are repatriated 
  Profit taking in market heavyweights may be bringing down
the index more than it seems natural  but the market isn t really
worried that today s fall means a change in the upward trend  
said Kenichi Hirano  operating officer at Tachibana Securities 
 On Friday  the S P 500 Index fell 0 9 percent after data from
the Reuters University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers showed
consumer confidence fell more than expected in early August 
dropping to its lowest level since March 
 The weaker figure underscores concern that consumer demand
remains soft  denting hopes for a rebound that have fuelled the
rally in stocks 
 While a moderate expansion is expected to continue in the
coming quarters in Japan  economists say the risk of a double dip
recession cannot be ruled out  especially if recovery is delayed
in the United States and other major economies 
  The headline figures were slightly weaker than expected but
the contents were not surprising   said Kyohei Morita  chief
economist at Barclays Capital Japan 
  But today s data was driven by stimulus steps in Japan and
overseas  and Japan s economy is far from self sustaining
growth

 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Aug 26  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average rose 0 6
percent on Wednesday  buoyed by U S  data that strengthened hopes
for an economic recovery although investors were cautious about
pushing the index higher ahead of an Aug  30 election in Japan 
Toyota Motor Corp gained after a source with direct knowledge
of the matter said the world s biggest automaker will cut its
global production capacity to match lower sales 
  But analysts said domestic investors were reluctant to
actively take positions ahead of the result of Sunday s election 
which many expect Japan s opposition Democratic Party to win 
Some  though  say the election is already a neutral trading
factor 
  Upbeat data included the Conference Board s August index of
consumer confidence that topped economists  forecasts  while the
S P Case Shiller home price index rose for a second consecutive
month in June  suggesting a recovery in two sectors crucial for
U S  recovery 
   The data is encouraging because it points to continued

10 564 56  with futures leading the cash market  Trade continued

 The broader Topix rose 0 6 percent to 970 63 
 Opinion polls show the main opposition Democratic Party of
Japan set for a sweeping victory on Sunday that would end more
than 50 years of almost unbroken rule by the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party  LDP  
  The election is also making it hard to buy  but I think the
market basically expects a victory by the Democratic party and
has factored that in   said Tachibana s Hirano 
 A solid win for the Democrats would raise the chances of
clearing a policy deadlock in parliament  where the opposition
controls the upper house 
  What the market would hate is anything leading to confusion 
such as if the Democrats didn t win a clear majority  That would
mean things continue much the same as they are now   he said 
 FOREIGN INVESTORS 
 Many Japanese investors are waiting to see how foreign
investors  long a key driver and direction setter for the Nikkei 
respond to the election results  said Hiroaki Osakabe  fund
manager at Chibagin Asset Management 
 For the last month or so foreign investors have been net
buyers of Japanese stocks each week  and market analysts say
their interest may grow even more if the Democrats win 
 Exporters  which had weighed on the Tokyo market on Tuesday

capacity by 10 percent  or 1 million vehicles  as early as the
current financial year to March 2010  But the source said the
extent and timing of the production cuts had not yet been set 
  The idling of plants had been a negative factor for Toyota

 TOKYO  Aug 26  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average hit
its highest point in 10 months on Wednesday after U S  data
strengthened hopes for an economic recovery  but trade was
cautious ahead of an Aug  30 election in Japan 
 Toyota Motor Corp gained after a source said it would cut its
global production capacity to match lower sales   while NEC
Electronics soared 11 percent on a report that it and merger
partner Renesas Technology Corp may get  2 1 billion in aid 
 The benchmark Nikkei extended gains in the afternoon to rise
1 4 percent  encouraged by a rise in Chinese stocks  market
players said  with some saying big buy orders in the cash market
appeared to have further lifted the index 
  There s no mistake that the economy is on a recovery track
from both the macro and micro perspective and the market is in an
upward trend   said Junichi Misawa  senior fund manager at STB

 Latest upbeat data included the Conference Board s August
index of consumer confidence that topped economists  forecasts 
while the S P Case Shiller home price index rose for a second
consecutive month in June  suggesting improvement in two sectors
crucial for a U S  recovery 
  But investors can t aggressively keep pushing the market
higher because of uncertainty about exit strategies  from unusual
policy measures world governments have taken  and because Japan
is highly likely to have a change in the government   Misawa
said

   Casio Computer soars on possible cellphone merger news
 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Aug 28  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average edged up
0 6 percent on Friday in thin trade  with the market largely
caught between investor reluctance to aggressively buy in the
face of weak Shanghai shares and wariness about selling before
Japan s August 30 election 
An eight day rising streak for the Dow helped sentiment  and
big gainers in Tokyo included Casio Computer Co which surged
after sources said it  NEC Corp and Hitachi Ltd are in talks to
merge their struggling cellphone operations 
 Shanghai shares lost 2 7 percent  led by bank stocks  after
local media reports that Chinese banks  August lending may have
dropped sharply from earlier in the year  trimming liquidity
flowing into the market 
 Analysts say investors have factored in a big win for Japan s
opposition Democratic Party in the election and the focus is now
shifting to post election events  including who will be the next
finance and economy ministers 
  Investors are basically squaring their positions ahead of
the weekend and the election  unwilling to sell in case foreign
investment pours into the market after the election and unwilling
to buy because of Shanghai   said Kenichi Hirano  operating
officer at Tachibana Securities 
  Though the market may well respond positively to a clear win
by the Democrats  mostly it s been factored in  Attention will
quickly turn to their policies and then to the wave of economic
indicators coming out next week  both in Japan and the U S  
 The Nikkei gained 60 17 points to 10 534 14 after falling 1 6
percent the previous day  It gained 2 9 percent on the week 
 The broader Topix rose 0 5 percent to 969 31 
 The Democrats lead Prime Minister Taro Aso s Liberal
Democratic Party in newspaper polls ahead of the election  An
opposition victory would end more than five decades of almost
continuous rule by the LDP and raise the chances of breaking a
stalemate in a divided parliament 
  Just having the election over will remove one big
uncertainty for the market  and then attention will shift to
policies   said Hiroaki Osakabe  a fund manager at Chibagin Asset
Management 
  Even if the Democrats don t win as much as predicted  I
don t think the market will fall that much  
 The market remained supported by positive sentiment after the
Dow industrials posted an eighth straight day of gains on
Thursday  But some additional downward pressure came from U S 
stock futures  which turned negative in Asian afternoon trade 
 CASIO CLIMBS  EXPORTERS UP
 Amid the generally lacklustre activity  Casio Computer shone 
shooting up 8 5 percent to 919 yen  NEC Corp rose 0 6 percent to
333 yen and Hitachi gained 1 6 percent to 327 yen 
 Exporters were firm on positive sentiment stemming from the
Dow s rising streak  Kyocera Corp rose 1 1 percent to 7 600 yen 
Canon Inc gained 1 9 percent to 3 690 yen and Tokyo Electron rose
1 8 percent to 5 090 yen 
 Tokyo Denpa Co  a maker of quartz oscillators and filters 
rocketed 15 8 percent to 735 yen after electronics parts maker
Murata Manufacturing Co said it would take 1 million shares in
the company  
 Toyo Tire   Rubber Co advanced 2 3 percent to 224 yen after
saying on Thursday it will invest 10 billion yen   107 million 
to build a tyre factory in China 
 But Toyota Motor Corp was flat at 4 040 yen percent after
saying it would end its production contract with NUMMI  a
California plant it has shared with General Motors for 25 years 
by March 2010 
 NTN Corp quickly swung into negative territory after the
bearing maker said it would make an announcement about a public
share offering later in the day 
 NTN slid 1 6 percent to 441 yen after dropping as much as 3 1
percent  Before the news  it had climbed about 6 percent at one
stage 
 Trade was light on the Tokyo exchange s first section  with

 HONG KONG  July 23  Reuters    Asian stocks climbed to a
10 month high on Thursday led by energy shares  though some
investors wondered if upward momentum from corporate earnings
reports justified increasingly pricey valuations 
 Major European stock market futures edged up  indicating a
slightly higher open after the FTSEurofirst 300 index 
closed at a 2009 high on Wednesday  U S  stock futures 
were up 0 4 percent 
 The U S  dollar hovered close to a seven week low and the
yen was being sold off  with traders basically tracking equity
markets as a gauge of investor penchant for risk taking 
 The four month rally in global stock markets has put
pressure on both currencies  which acted as havens throughout
the financial crisis 
 The latest batch of U S  corporate results have been mixed 
with solid earnings from Apple Inc  and Starbucks Corp
 enough to boost the Nasdaq for an 11th straight day 
while results from Morgan Stanley  were disappointing 
 Still  the pace of positive revisions to earnings estimates
as well as bullish economic signals have investors increasingly
optimistic about developing Asia s growth prospects 
  Emerging East Asia could see a V shaped recovery  with
growth dipping sharply in 2009 before regaining last years pace
in 2010  said Jong Wha Lee  chief economist with the Asian
Development Bank  said in a report 
 However  the ADB report said policymakers should plan exit
strategies to unwind policy stimulus to avert inflation
expectations  but not yet implement them 
 Hong Kong s Hang Seng index was the top gaining market in
the region  After a 1 3 percent dip on Wednesday  the index was
up 2 3 percent   with property stocks and
resource related names among the high flyers  Asia s top oil
refiner  Sinopec  0386 HK   jumped 3 9 percent 
 Some investors were beginning to question whether equity
prices reflected fundamentals  especially in hot industries 
For example valuations of real estate stocks in Hong Kong on
the basis of 12 month forward price to earnings have been above
the 5 year average since May  according to I B E S estimates 
 Japan s Nikkei share average  ended 0 7 percent
higher as strength in high tech firms such as Kyocera Corp
 6971 T  offset weakness in domestically oriented companies
like KDDI  9433 T  
 Since hitting a two month low on July 13  the index has
rallied 8 2 percent 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
 was up 0 9 percent  with gains in the energy
sector leading the broader market  Since July 13  the MSCI
index has climbed 13 percent and it reached its highest level
on Thursday since last September 
  The market has had a good run     and a number of people
have been suggesting things are getting a little bit
expensive   said Martin Angel  dealer at Patersons Securities
Ltd in Australia 
 RISK SEEKING BIAS
 Over the next month  oil companies around the world will be
reporting their quarterly results 
 Oil prices shed early losses and turned slightly higher

U S  dollar index  and the MSCI all country stocks index
 is at  0 93  the tightest level of the year 
  The overall bias is toward risk seeking  as the stock

 TOKYO  Sept 2  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average slid
2 5 percent on Wednesday  dragged down by exporters hit by a
stronger yen amid renewed worry about the health of the U S 
financial system 
 Elpida Memory plunged more than 17 percent after Japan s sole
maker of PC memory said it would issue new shares to raise up to
 844 million  while retailers including Aeon Corp fell amid a
broad market sell off 
 Financial shares fell on Wall Street after Sanford C 
Bernstein Research downgraded American International Group to
 underperform  from  market perform   and said there was no
reason for shareholders to continue owning the stock  leading it
to plummet on Tuesday 
  Given that the one year anniversary of the Lehman Brothers
failure is approaching  investors are especially easy to spook
about financial shares  The whole sector is very sensitive to bad
news   said Noritsugu Hirakawa  a strategist at Oksasan
Securities 
  Certainly indicators in various nations have been improving 
but the fact that markets have been falling despite this suggests
that a bit of downward adjustment may be in the offing  
 In a possible sign of this  the Nikkei broke below its 25 day
moving average  which currently comes in around 10 400 and had
been acting as a support for nearly the last week 
 The benchmark had pared losses slightly to shed 267 81 points
to 10 262 25 by midafternoon  after falling as much as 2 9
percent  The broader Topix lost 2 2 percent to 947 87 
  The fall below the 25 day moving average is probably only
temporary  but does suggest some adjustment ahead   said Okasan s
Hirakawa 
  Still  at this point there s nothing bad enough to take it
below 10 000  which I think will hold for a while  
 Other market players said the day s falls were mainly just
profit taking  noting that the market had risen about 50 percent
from its March lows 
 The S P 500 fell 2 2 percent on Tuesday to 998 04 as
scepticism that stocks can add to a nearly 50 percent rally over
the last six months prevailed in the market 
 The fall came despite data showing the Institute for Supply
Management s  ISM  closely watched barometer of U S  factory
activity jumped to 52 9 from 48 9 in July  the highest level
since June 2007 
 The dollar pared losses to stand flat at 92 85 yen  Earlier 
the Japanese currency had spiked to a seven week high against the
greenback and the euro as renewed fears about the financial
sector made investors cautious about riskier assets

6206,227721,KYOCY,Nikkei set to fall on yen  new U S stimulus talk,news,"TOKYO  July 8  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average is likely to
fall for a sixth straight day on Wednesday  with exporters seen
hurt by a stronger yen and after talk of a second U S  government
stimulus plan sent U S  stocks to their lowest level in 10 weeks 
 Komatsu and other machinery makers will be in focus  with
machinery orders  a leading indicator of capital expenditure  set
to be released before the start of trade 
 The data will likely do little to dispel the view that
corporate spending will weaken in coming months as factory output
is at low levels 
 But market players said despite an expected fall in the
market on Wednesday  that should be still part of a correction
after a recent bullish run up  in which the benchmark Nikkei has
recovered about 40 percent from its March lows 
  Calls for more stimulus steps are emerging in the U S  as
the ones it has already launched haven t led to an improvement in
consumption   said Hiroichi Nishi  general manager of equity
marketing at Nikko Cordial Securities 
  But there s still a possibility that those economic steps
which were quite large will gradually start to have an impact 
Talk like this is also a sign that the government is determined
not to let the economy deteriorate further  
 An adviser to President Barack Obama said the United States
should be planning for a possible second round of fiscal stimulus
to further prop up the economy after the  787 billion rescue
package launched in February 
 That heightened fears that the economy is not yet on the path
to recovery and that the corporate earnings season starting this
week will be weak  sending the Dow Jones industrial average to
its lowest close since April 28 
 The yen and dollar rose broadly on Tuesday also on
uncertainty about the global economic outlook  The dollar was
down 0 2 percent at 94 75 yen in early Asia trade 
 Nikkei futures traded in Chicago fell 0 5 percent from their
Osaka close  pointing to a lower start 
 Market players expect the Nikkei to trade between 9 450 and
9 700 on Wednesday  It fell 0 3 percent the previous day to end
at 9 647 79

   H2 recovery in doubt
  Rewrites  adds CEO comments  First Solar share indication 
 By Christoph Steitz
 FRANKFURT  July 14  Reuters    Q Cells SE  the world s
biggest maker of solar cells  dropped its full year sales
outlook after prices fell sharply in the second quarter  denting
hopes of a recovery and sending shares across the sector lower 
  Solar cell makers have been hit by a steep decline in
prices for cells  mainly caused by an oversupply that built up
during the boom years of 2007 and 2008 
  Q Cells Chief Executive Anton Milner told analysts on
Tuesday that the second quarter price fall was much worse than
the company had expected   Prices accelerated down in the second
quarter   he said 
  Earlier this month  Q Cells said it was not planning to
issue a profit warning  denying market talk that had driven its
shares down  In May  the company slashed its 2009 sales outlook
for the third time in six months 
  Shares in solar stocks in Europe and the U S fell after the
news  with Q Cells leading the pack  down 13 2 percent  while
German peers SolarWorld  Solon  and Phoenix Solar were all down
2 3 to 3 2 percent 
 U S  listed First Solar  Suntech and SunPower also dropped
between 1 7 to 3 2 percent 
 Shares in Norwegian peer REC fell up to 3 percent before
gaining 0 8 percent  after it said a recent rights issue was 60
percent oversubscribed  while London listed PV Crystalox was 4 1
percent lower 
   The case of  Q Cells is more problematic since it suggests
the company has problems with the Asian competition that can
produce at much lower prices   said Philippe de Weck  fund
manager at Pictet  who is managing the company s Clean Energy
fund 
 Q Cells s Japanese competitors Sharp Corp and Kyocera  were
down 0 3 percent and up 0 5 percent respectively in Frankfurt
trade  albeit at very low trading volumes 
 Q Cells said on Tuesday it no longer expects sales to reach
1 3 billion to 1 6 billion euros  adding that it is was not
possible to make a reliable forecast 
 
 A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
  The  Q Cells  numbers are a huge disappointment  After the
departure of CFO Schuening a few weeks ago  the company strongly
denied that this had something to do with weak Q2 results   DZ
Bank analyst Sven Kuerten wrote in a note  referring to the
finance director who resigned in June 
 Q Cells said second quarter sales fell to 142 million euros
from 310 million a year ago  posting a loss before interest and
tax of 62 million euros  down from a profit of 60 million 
 The move also raises questions about whether the industry
will recover in the second half  as many companies have hoped 
following a slowdown in price falls as well as stimulus packages
in the United States and China 
 Q Cells s warning  a recent profit warning from industry
bellwether Phoenix Solar as well as negative statements by LDK
Solar have raised concerns that such a positive outlook might
not be based on concrete evidence 
 Nedim Cen  who took over as chief financial officer from
Hartmut Schuening at Q Cells last month  said sales would remain
under pressure in the second quarter 
  Regarding prices  we expect a very tough environment  in
the second half of the year    he told a conference call 
 However  the chief executive of SolarWorld  Frank Asbeck was
more positive  saying he did not expect any nasty surprises in
its financial results 
 The cash hungry solar sector has also been hurt by the
global credit squeeze that has made refinancing difficult 
sparking a wide range of share issues and placements 

  Q Cells recently raised 780 million euros   1 09 billion 
in cash by issuing a convertible bond as well as selling a 17 2
percent stake in Norwegian peer REC 
 Milner told Reuters in late May that it had no plans to
further beef up its finances

overall U S  sales for September as the crisis on Wall Street

  With the U S  auto sales down about 30 percent  it s become
clear that financial problems are finally spreading to the real

  That is leading to a sell off in stocks sensitive to the
health of the economy

   Japan ruling party puts up  154 bln stimulus plan   draft
   Green tinged spending equivalent to 3 1 percent of GDP
   Machinery orders rise due to non manufacturers
   Exporters still suffer from weak overseas demand
 By Sumio Ito
 TOKYO  April 9  Reuters    The Japanese government should
spend a bigger than expected 15 4 trillion yen   154 billion  on
economic stimulus  the ruling party said on Thursday  causing
bond yields to rise but boosting stocks in sectors seen
benefiting from the higher spending 
 The new spending should be funded by issuing new bonds  the
party said in a draft proposal issued ahead of a major policy
speech by Prime Minister Taro Aso later on Thursday and the
announcement of the package on Friday 
 The stimulus spending    3 1 percent of GDP    is to battle
Japan s deepest recession since World War Two  which has slashed
exports and corporate profits  prompting firms to cut production
and lay off thousands of workers 
 Bonds sank because the size of the proposed spending is
higher than an earlier mooted level of around 10 trillion yen 
traders said  raising the prospect of a large supply of new
bonds 
 But shares in automakers and solar power related firms rose
after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposal for measures
to promote the use of solar panels and fuel efficient cars 
 The plan came out as data showed Japan s core machinery
orders unexpectedly rose in February due to gains in the services
sector  in a tentative sign domestic demand may be stabilising 
 Analysts warned  however  that the orders also showed that
Japanese exporters continue to suffer  highlighting the challenge
the government faces as it compiles additional stimulus measures
to combat the worst recession since World War Two 
  Looking at the components  orders from non manufacturers
increased for two consecutive months  showing that domestic
demand is starting to turn around  In contrast  external demand
is still weak   said Satoru Ogasawara  an economist at Credit
Suisse 
 Core private sector machinery orders  a leading indicator of
capital spending  rose 1 4 percent in February from the previous
month for the first gain in five months  The median market
forecast was for a 6 7 percent fall  
 Orders from non manufacturers rose 3 3 percent in February 
while those of manufacturers  hit hard by the slide in exports 
fell 8 1 percent 
 BONDS FRET   GREEN  STOCKS RISE
 Machinery orders still fell nearly a third from a year
earlier but the unexpected uptick added to the weight on bonds
from the stimulus package  The benchmark 10 yr yield rose 2 5
basis points to a nearly five month high of 1 480 percent  
  Extra issuance of around 10 trillion yen is now expected
given the size of the stimulus  Not surprisingly the bond market
sees this as bearish news   said Tetsuya Miura  chief
fixed income strategist at Shinko Securities 
 The LDP urged the government to add 10 trillion yen to a loan
guarantee scheme for small businesses and recommended subsidies
for environmentally friendly cars and solar panels 
 Shares in Toyota Motor Corp  maker of the  Prius  hybrid 
rose 2 4 percent while those of Mitsubishi Motors Corp  the only
mass volume carmaker with an electric car prototype on the road 
climbed 2 8 percent 
 Sharp Corp  the world s No 2 maker of solar cells  surged 8
percent while Kyocera Corp  the world s No 4 solar cell maker 
climbed 1 9 percent 
 The package still faces a potentially stormy ride through
parliament  where the opposition controls the upper house and can
stall legislation 
 Aso has threatened to bring forward an election due by
October this year if the opposition stalls the package 
 The package would add to spending of 12 trillion yen already
planned under previously announced stimulus measures  taking the
total stimulus spending to combat the global financial crisis to
around 5 5 percent of GDP 
 The Japanese economy shrank 3 1 percent in October December
from the previous quarter and is expected to have shrunk a
further 2 5 percent in January March 
 The contraction is bigger than in other major economies 
despite Japan s banking system being among the least damaged by
the credit crisis  because of the country s reliance on exports
of cars and electronics

   Japan Tobacco jumps after Tribac Leaf purchase
   Largely directionless  awaiting U S  indicators
 TOKYO  June 15  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average edged
down 0 5 percent on Monday  with chip shares such as Advantest
Corp hurt by a disappointing outlook from U S  chipmaker National
Semiconductor 
 But Japan Tobacco jumped nearly 4 percent after the world s
third largest cigarette maker said it would buy British company
Tribac Leaf to secure a stable supply of tobacco leaf 
 Market analysts said shares were taking a breather after
closing above 10 000 on Friday for the first time in eight
months  with investors focused on U S  indicators due out later
this week 
  A general feeling of the U S  economic recession easing has
helped bring us this far  but for now there s a sense of
achievement at getting over 10 000  and this is likely to spark
profit taking   said Noritsugu Hirakawa  a strategist at Okasan
Securities 
 U S  May housing starts  producer prices and industrial
production are set to be released on Tuesday  with consumer
prices coming out on Wednesday 
  Last week  the market gained on positive news such as
Chinese industrial production figures  which make it hard to deny
that the global economy is improving   said Kazuhiro Takahashi 
general manager of equities at Daiwa Securities SMBC 
  There are a number of U S  indicators due out later in the
week  which the market will use to confirm trends  But today 
there won t be a lot of direction  
 The benchmark Nikkei shed 53 35 points to 10 082 47 after
closing at 10 135 82 on Friday  its highest close since October
7  The broader Topix lost 0 1 percent to 949 29 
 National Semiconductor on Friday posted quarterly results and
gave an outlook that topped Wall Street s estimates  but the
guidance fell short in comparison to an outlook from fellow
chipmaker Texas Instruments earlier in the week 
 National Semiconductor s shares fell 6 1 percent while the
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 1 8 percent 
 That hit tech shares here  with Advantest losing 2 8 percent
to 1 798 yen and Kyocera Corp falling 1 7 percent to 7 450 yen 
TDK Corp dropped 3 1 percent to 4 360 yen 
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc fell 3 7 percent to 4 180
yen after the Nikkei business daily reported over the weekend
that the planned share issue by Japan s third largest bank is
expected to raise more than 900 billion yen   9 2 billion  
 The share issue  which could reach close to 1 trillion yen 
would be up from SMFG s April plan to raise up to 800 billion
yen  the Nikkei said 
 Reuters last month reported that SMFG s share issue could
reach  9 1 billion
