According to news sources  the letter in question alleged that Best Buy CEO Corie Barry had engaged in an inappropriate romantic relationship with a fellow executive prior to winning election as CEO in June 2019   

 The Board takes allegations of misconduct seriously regardless of who is the subject   explained Best Buy s Audit Committee in a statement   When the Board received an anonymous letter regarding Corie Barry  the Audit Committee immediately retained outside legal counsel  Sidley Austin LLP  to conduct an independent review  Ms  Barry fully cooperated with the review  which has now concluded  The Board supports the continued leadership of the Company by Ms  Barry  To preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the process  the Board will have no further comment

166793,388309,BBY,Trump administration orders purge of Kaspersky products from U S  government,news,"By Dustin Volz WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration on Wednesday told U S  government agencies to remove Kaspersky Lab products from their networks  saying it was concerned the Moscow based cyber security firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that using its anti virus software could jeopardize national security  The decision represents a sharp response to what U S  intelligence agencies have described as a national security threat posed by Russia in cyberspace  following an election year marred by allegations that Moscow weaponized the internet in an attempt to influence its outcome  In a statement  Kaspersky Lab rejected the allegations  as it has done repeatedly in recent months  and said its critics were misinterpreting Russian data sharing laws that only applied to communications services   No credible evidence has been presented publicly by anyone or any organization as the accusations are based on false allegations and inaccurate assumptions   the company said  The Department of Homeland Security  DHS  issued a directive to federal agencies ordering them to identify Kaspersky products on their information systems within 30 days and begin to discontinue their use within 90 days   The order applies only to civilian government agencies and not the Pentagon  but U S  intelligence leaders said earlier this year that Kaspersky was already generally not allowed on military networks  In a statement accompanying its directive  DHS said it was  concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies  and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks   It continued   The risk that the Russian government  whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky  could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U S  national security   The department said it would provide Kaspersky with the opportunity to submit a written response to address the allegations  The agency said other entities claiming commercial interests affected by the directive could also submit information  Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied that it has ties to any government and said it would not help a government with cyber espionage   However  the company has not been able to shake off the allegations  Last week   Best Buy  Co  N BBY   the No 1 U S  electronics retailer  said it was pulling Kaspersky Lab s cyber security products from its shelves and website   TOUGH DECISION  Rob Joyce  the White House cyber security coordinator  said Wednesday at the Billington CyberSecurity Summit that the Trump administration made a  risk based decision  to order Kaspersky Lab s products removed from federal agencies  Asked by Reuters whether there was a smoking gun showing Kaspersky Lab had provided intelligence to the Russian government  Joyce replied   As we evaluated the technology  we decided it was a risk we couldn t accept   Some cyber security experts have warned that blacklisting Kaspersky Lab could prompt a retaliation from Russian President Vladimir Putin  Joyce said those concerns were a factor but that a  tough decision  ultimately had to be made to protect government systems  The direct financial impact of the decision will likely be minimal for Kaspersky Lab  one of the world s leading anti virus software companies  which was founded in 1997 and now counts over 400 million global customers  Federal contracting databases reviewed by Reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from Kaspersky  and an employee told Reuters in July the company s federal government revenue was  miniscule   But Kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products  so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases  U S  officials say  The decision by the Trump administration came as the U S  Senate was planning to vote as soon as this week on a defense policy spending bill that includes language that would ban Kaspersky Lab products from being used by U S  government agencies  Democratic U S  Senator Jeanne Shaheen  who had led efforts in Congress to crack down on Kaspersky Lab  applauded the Trump administration s announcement   The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are alarming and well documented   Shaheen said  adding that she expected Congress to act soon to reinforce the decision by passing legislation  Also on Wednesday  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar wrote to DHS asking whether the agency used Kaspersky products in relation to any critical infrastructure  such as election equipment  banks or energy suppliers  and if it knew whether any voting systems used the company s software

Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now

166837,388353,BBY,3 Investing Facts About Required Minimum Distributions You Need To Know   January 20  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as Best Buy  BBY   a current top ranked dividend stock 
But that s just half of retirement planning  The second part  the  distribution phase   sometimes gets overlooked even though it can be more fun to think about  That s because the distribution phase is where you determine how to spend your hard earned assets 
Planning for the distribution phase is the time where you may make decisions about where you ll want to live in retirement  whether you ll want to travel  hobbies you may pursue  and other decisions that will affect your retirement spending 
In addition to these considerations  it is essential to take into account the RMD that applies to most retirement accounts  Basically  this is an IRS requirement that you withdraw a certain amount from your qualified retirement accounts once you reach age 72 
Why does the IRS require these distributions  It s straightforward   they need to ensure they get their tax  In the event that this standard didn t exist  individuals could live off other pay and never pay tax on their retirement investment returns  So  that cash could be left to family or companions as an inheritance without the IRS getting any taxes from you 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
Which types of accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRAs  401 k s  457 plans  and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When does it become necessary to begin taking distributions  Your first distribution must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you turn 72  for most accounts   Also  if you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year after the calendar year in which you retire 
For each year after your required starting date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you don t need to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you covered taxes before contributing  Other varieties of Roth accounts require RMDs  But  there are approaches to avoid them   for instance  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What happens if I don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or not taking a large enough distribution  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

166838,388354,BBY,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   February 03  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
Like the majority of investors  you re most likely working on a retirement portfolio that will provide a large enough nest egg to give you a comfortable retirement  Retirement financial planners refer to this as the  accumulation phase   Your goal in this phase is to choose investments with long term growth potential   for example  a current top ranked dividend stock like Best Buy  BBY  
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Planning for the distribution phase is the time where you may make decisions about where you ll want to live in retirement  whether you ll want to travel  hobbies you may pursue  and other decisions that will affect your retirement spending 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you turn 72  If you retire after 72  you must withdraw your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you retire

Example  Ann is 71 and must take her first RMD in the year following the year she reaches age 72  Her year end IRA balance the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  The result of dividing  100 000 by 27 4 is  3 649 63   the amount that Ann must withdraw for her first RMD

166854,388370,BBY,Is Best Buy  BBY  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Best Buy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 02  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 33  However  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Best Buy s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 13 45 over the past five years The stock s PE however compares quite favorably with the Retail Wholesale Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 84  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile Best Buy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 92  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Best Buy has a P S ratio of just 0 55  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 52x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Best Buy currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Best Buy a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Best Buy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C  This gives BBY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been bullish  While the current quarter estimate has seen seven upward and no downward movements  the current year estimate has also seen nine upward and no downward movements over the past two months This has had a positive effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus has increased 4 5  over the past two months  the current year estimate has also climbed 3 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Best Buy Co   Inc  Price and Consensus   Such bullish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBest Buy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 11  of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  2 instils investors  optimism the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite a sluggish industry rank  bullish analyst sentiments  favorable past industry performance and a good Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Best Buy 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert

166888,388404,BBY,Best Buy  BBY  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of Best Buy Co   NYSE BBY  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 11 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  84 06 in the previous session  Best Buy Co  has gained 58 3  since the start of the year compared to the 23  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 47 6  return for the Zacks Retail   Consumer Electronics industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 26  2019  Best Buy reported EPS of  1 13 versus consensus estimate of  1 04 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 33  
For the current fiscal year  Best Buy is expected to post earnings of  5 92 per share on  43 52 billion in revenues  This represents a 11 28  change in EPS on a 1 5  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 15 per share on  44 25 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 3 94  and 1 68   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Best Buy may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Best Buy has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10X versus its peer group s average of 3 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 62  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Best Buy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Best Buy meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Best Buy shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-buy-bby-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200492104,200492104
166889,388405,BBY,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   December 16  2019,opinion,"If you do not make a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the specified deadline  the IRS could hit you with a big penalty   50   For example  if you were required to withdraw a minimum of  4 000 and you did not  you would be obliged to pay  2 000 
Like the majority of investors  you re most likely working on a retirement portfolio that will provide a large enough nest egg to give you a comfortable retirement  Retirement financial planners refer to this as the  accumulation phase   Your goal in this phase is to choose investments with long term growth potential   for example  a current top ranked dividend stock like Best Buy  BBY  
But that s just half of retirement planning  The second part  the  distribution phase   sometimes gets overlooked even though it can be more fun to think about  That s because the distribution phase is where you determine how to spend your hard earned assets 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you hit age 70 1 2 
Why does the IRS requires you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
Which types of accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRAs  401 k s  457 plans  and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you arrive at age 70 1 2 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 70 and will take her first RMD in the year she turns 70 1 2  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 70 1 2

166890,388406,BBY,Best Buy  BBY  Is Up 3 34  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Best Buy  BBY   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Best Buy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for BBY that show why this consumer electronics retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For BBY  shares are up 3 34  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Consumer Electronics industry is down 0 44  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 17 34  compares favorably with the industry s 5 78  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Best Buy have increased 29 04  over the past quarter  and have gained 70 74  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 6 59  and 27 71   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to BBY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  BBY is currently averaging 3 645 448 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with BBY 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost BBY s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 75 to  5 94 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that BBY is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Best Buy on your short list ",2019-12-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-buy-bby-is-up-334-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200493862,200493862
166909,388425,BBY,3 Reasons Why Best Buy  BBY  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Best Buy  BBY  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this consumer electronics retailer a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Best Buy is 22   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 1  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Best Buy has an S TA ratio of 2 91  which means that the company gets  2 91 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 1 67  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Best Buy is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 1 3  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Best Buy have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Best Buy a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

This combination indicates that Best Buy is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-12-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-best-buy-bby-is-a-great-growth-stock-200489357,200489357
166910,388426,BBY,Best Buy  BBY  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Best Buy  BBY  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Best Buy basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Best Buy  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Best Buy
For the fiscal year ending January   2020  this consumer electronics retailer is expected to earn  5 92 per share  which is a change of 11 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Best Buy  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

166945,388461,BBY,U S  stock futures slightly higher with inflation and Yellen ahead,news,"Investing com   Wall Street futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Thursday as investors looked ahead to the latest reading on inflation amid a slew of other data and waited for any indications from Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen on the future path of monetary policy 
The blue chip Dow futures inched up 10 points  or 0 05   by 6 58AM ET  11 58GMT   the S P 500 futures edged forward 2 points  or 0 09   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures gained 14 points  or 0 29  
On the data front  the focus will be on the consumer price index  CPI  for October released at 8 30AM ET  13 30GMT  with consensus looking for the annual inflation reading to hit a two year high 
The last Fed statement indicated that inflation had  increased somewhat  since earlier in the year but had remained below the 2  target 
Of course  traders will also take account of continuing developments in the labor markets with the publication of weekly jobless claims  though the Fed seemed less concerned as  job gains had been solid  and most members considered the U S  economy to be at  or very close  to its mandate of maximum employment 
Also all released at 8 30AM ET  13 30GMT   market players will digest the October building permits and housing starts  along with the Philly Fed survey for the month of November 
Regardless  the main focal point for markets on Thursday will undoubtedly be Fed chair Janet Yellen s testimony on the economic outlook before the U S  Congress Joint Economic Committee at 10 00AM ET  15 00GMT   Her prepared remarks are scheduled to be pre released at 8 00AM ET  13 00GMT  
Yellen may well be asked to comment on the day s data when answering questions from Congress 
She will likely be asked how tax cuts or fiscal stimulus under President elect Donald Trump could affect the economic and interest rate outlook 
Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy  The Fed left interest rates unchanged earlier this month  in a widely expected decision  but signaled it could hike in December as the economy gathers momentum and inflation picks up 
Besides Yellen  New York Fed president William Dudley and Fed governor Lael Brainard  both voters on this year s committee  will also be speaking at public events 
Markets are currently pricing an 85 8  chance of a rate hike at the Fed s December 13 14 meeting  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
A rally in the U S  dollar showed signs of fatigue early on Thursday  after the greenback hit its highest level in nearly 14 years against a basket of major currencies the day before  as U S  bond yields pulled back from multi month highs 
The dollar index was last down 0 35  at 100 03 by 6 58AM ET  11 58GMT   after climbing to 100 59 the day before  a level not seen since April 2003 
Additionally  the yield on the U S  10 year Treasury was down 2 2 basis points at 2 201  in early trade  pulling back from a 10 month high of 2 302  set earlier in the week 
The dollar s rise moved in step with the surge in U S  yields in recent sessions  as markets wagered that increased fiscal spending and tax cuts under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation  which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates 
On the earnings front  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT    Best Buy   NYSE BBY  and Staples  NASDAQ SPLS  were among companies scheduled to report before the opening bell  while Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  and Gap  NYSE GPS  were some of the firms to publish after the close 
Meanwhile  oil prices were on the rise Thursday as OPEC ministers commented over a possible deal on output 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih showed optimism on Thursday that OPEC would formalize a preliminary oil output deal reached in Algeria in September 
 I m still optimistic that the consensus reached in Algeria for capping production will translate  God willing  into caps on states  levels and fair and balanced cuts among countries   he told Saudi owned Al Arabiya TV 
Similarly  Algerian energy minister Noureddine Boutarfa insisted that OPEC was closing in on a consensus for a 6 month output deal

166948,388464,BBY,U S  inflation  labor market data bolster Fed December rate hike,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in six months in October on rising gasoline costs and rents  suggesting a pickup in inflation that potentially clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December  Prospects for a rate hike next month also got a boost from other data on Thursday showing first time applications for unemployment benefits tumbling to a 43 year low last week and housing starts surging to a nine year high in October  The reports painted an upbeat picture of the economy early in the fourth quarter and came as Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers that the U S  central bank could lift borrowing costs  relatively soon     Today s data give the Fed more evidence to support a rate hike next month   said Alan MacEachin  corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna  Virginia   The only thing standing in the way at this point would be a disastrous jobs report in early December  a remote possibility at best    The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0 4 percent last month after rising 0 3 percent in September  In the 12 months through October  the CPI advanced 1 6 percent  the biggest year on year increase since October 2014  The CPI increased 1 5 percent in the year to September  Underlying inflation continued to slow last month as healthcare costs moderated after recent hefty gains  But with rents pushing higher  that trend is unlikely to be sustained  The so called core CPI  which strips out food and energy costs  climbed 0 1 percent last month after a similar gain in September  That slowed the year on year increase in the core CPI to 2 1 percent from a 2 2 percent rise in September   The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1 7 percent  The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  government bonds fell  The broader PHLX housing index  HGX   which includes builders  building products and mortgage companies  rose 0 83 percent  outpacing gains on the U S  stock market   In another report  the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 19 000 to a seasonally adjusted 235 000 for the week ended Nov  12  the lowest level since November 1973  Claims have now been below 300 000  a threshold associated with a healthy labor market  for 89 straight weeks  That is the longest run since 1970  when the labor market was much smaller  Firming inflation  strong retail sales  an improving housing and manufacturing sector as well as a labor market that is approaching full employment likely satisfy the criteria for the Fed to raise its overnight benchmark interest rate at its Dec  13 14 policy meeting   Yellen told lawmakers on Thursday that a rate hike  could well become appropriate relatively soon   The Fed this month left interest rates unchanged  The central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade  INHERITING A STRONG ECONOMY  Data so far suggests an acceleration in economic growth at the start of the fourth quarter   The Atlanta Fed on Thursday raised its fourth quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by three tenths of a percentage point to a 3 6 percent annual rate  The economy grew at a 2 9 percent pace in the third quarter   The stream of upbeat data suggest that president elect Donald Trump is inheriting a strong economy  which has been credited to economic policies under the Obama administration   Trump seems to have hit the jackpot on dumb luck in inheriting an economy that is the strongest and the closest to full employment in years   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at  MUFG Union Bank in New York  Last month  a 7 0 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for more than half of the increase in the CPI  Rents increased 0 4 percent last month after rising 0 3 percent   Households also paid more for a range of other goods and services last month  including new motor vehicles  apparel  education  auto insurance and tobacco  But they got a respite from food prices  which were unchanged for a fourth straight month and food consumed at home declined for a sixth consecutive month  Medical care costs were unchanged for a second month and prescription medicine price increases also moderated from September s strong gain   Falling food prices are  however  hurting retailers like Wal Mart Stores  N WMT   The world s largest retailer on Thursday reported lower than expected quarterly sales at established U S  stores      With the labor market firming and rents rising  housing is getting a lift  In a third report  the Commerce Department said housing starts jumped 25 5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1 32 million units last month  the highest level since August 2007   The percent increase was the biggest since July 1982  Starts increased in all four regions last month  Single family homebuilding  which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market  jumped 10 7 percent to a nine year high  Housing starts for the volatile multi family segment soared 68 8 percent

In her prepared remarks to the U S  Congress Joint Economic Committee  Yellen indicated that the general feeling of the Fed officials at the November 2 policy meeting was that an increase in rates could  become appropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee s objectives  
She herself further warned that there were dangers in waiting  too long  before proceeding with the removal of accommodative monetary policy 
 Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long  it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee s longer run policy goals   she warned 
She did however follow up with reiterating her belief that future rate hikes would  gradual  and insisted that  the economic outlook is inherently uncertain  and  as always  the appropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the outlook and associated risks  
Having avoided any direct comments in her speech on the effect of the election of Donald Trump to the U S  presidency on monetary policy  Yellen faced the issue in questions from Congress 
She explained that there will be many economic policies which Congress and the administration will consider in the coming months 
 When there is greater clarity  the  Fed  will have to factor  that into  their assessments and perhaps adjust the outlook depending on what happens   Yellen said 
In response to a direct question  Yellen also confirmed that she fully intended to serve out her full term up to February 2018  As a reminder  there had been some speculation that critiques from Trump could make Yellen decide to resign before the end of her term as Fed chair 
In another Fed appearance on Thursday  William Dudley  head of the New York Fed and voting member  made no remarks on monetary policy 
Fed governor Lael Brainard and Chicago Fed president Charles Evans were also scheduled for appearances later in the day 
On the economic data front  annual headline inflation ticked up to a two year high  coming out in line with consensus  though the core readings on both a month on month and annualized basis eased unexpectedly 
In the labor market  initial jobless claims in the week ending November 12 fell by 19 000 to 235 000  beating expectations for an increase to 257 000 and hitting the lowest level since 1973 
Separately  the Commerce Department said housing starts surged 25  in October to hit 1 323 million units  a nine year high  while building permits rose 0 3  to 1 229 million units 
After the slew of data and remarks by Yellen  odds for a rate hike in December jumped briefly to 95 4   from 85 8  the day before  They later eased and last stood at 90 6   according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool

166994,388510,BBY,U S  new home sales race to near nine year high,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    New U S  single family home sales unexpectedly surged in July  reaching their highest level in nearly nine years amid robust demand  brightening the housing market outlook and bolstering views that economic growth will pick up in the third quarter  Housing market strength should offset some of the drag from manufacturing  with other data on Tuesday showing production at factories remaining constrained by weak orders   A very rosy picture is beginning to emerge on the housing market  pointing to sustained buoyancy in the sector s recovery  which remains one of the few bright spots for the U S  economy   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York  The Commerce Department said new home sales jumped 12 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654 000 units last month  the highest level since October 2007  It was the fifth straight monthly gain in new home sales  July s increase  however  likely exaggerates housing market strength as it has not been matched by robust housing starts  Still  sales were up 31 3 percent from a year ago   Economists had forecast single family home sales  which account for about 9 6 percent of overall home sales  slipping to a rate of 580 000 units last month  July s surprise increase pushed new home sales well above their second quarter average  pointing to sustained momentum in the market for new homes   The gain came mostly from homes not yet started or still under construction  suggesting a rebound in residential construction investment  which was a minor drag on economic growth in the second quarter  Housing market strength  marked by rising home values which are boosting household wealth  is helping to buoy consumer spending  cushioning the blow to the economy from a downturn in business spending as well as an inventory correction  Tightening labor market conditions  which are steadily lifting wages  as well as mortgage rates near historic lows are supporting housing  Reports last week showed groundbreaking on single family housing projects rising to a five month high in July and sentiment among homebuilders increasing in August  Robust demand for new homes is boosting homebuilders like  Toll Brothers   N TOL   which on Tuesday reported a rise in revenue for the fourth straight quarter  The luxury homebuilder said it had sold more houses at higher prices  The solid housing market is also supporting purchases of big ticket electronics such as home theater systems  fattening profits for companies like  Best Buy   N BBY   The largest U S  electronics retailer on Tuesday reported a higher than expected quarterly profit and raised its earnings outlook  RAISES NEAR TERM OUTLOOK New home sales are likely benefiting from a chronic shortage of previously owned houses available for sale  With sales surging  the inventory of new homes on the market fell to an eight month low in July  This means builders will need to ramp up construction activity to meet demand  At July s sales pace it would take 4 3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market  the fewest since June 2013  and down from 4 9 months in June    This marginally raises our near term outlook for the housing market  as tightness in the new home market suggests further impetus to new construction ahead   said Andrew Hollenhorst  an economist at  Citigroup   NYSE C  in New York  In the wake of the report  the broader PHLX housing index  HGX   which includes builders  building products and mortgage companies  rose 2 07 percent  outperforming the overall U S  stock market   Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder D R  Horton Inc  N DHI  rallied 3 43 percent and  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  surged 3 89 percent  Toll Brothers vaulted 8 5 percent  The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  government debt fell   New single family homes sales soared 40 0 percent in the Northeast and increased 1 2 percent in the Midwest  Sales in the South  which accounts for more than half of new home sales  jumped 18 1 percent to their highest level since July 2007  Sales were flat in the West  which has seen a sharp increase in home prices amid tight inventories    Momentum is finally shifting back toward the new home market  particularly in the South  which has seen sales and new construction take off this year as job growth and in migration have strengthened   said Mark Vitner  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina  Separately  data firm IHS Markit said its flash U S  manufacturing purchasing managers  index slipped to a reading of 52 1 in August from July s nine month high of 52 9  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the factory sector  Manufacturers reported slower order growth this month   with some companies saying that a number of clients had adopted a wait and a see approach until the outcome of the U S  presidential election in November   A third report from the Richmond Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region covering Maryland  Virginia  West Virginia and the Carolinas plummeted to its lowest level since January 2013  There were sharp contractions in new orders and order backlogs  and workers saw a reduction in hours  
 This reminds us that goods production in the economy isn t going quite as well as housing   said Steve Blitz  chief economist at M Science in New York ",2016-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-new-home-sales-race-to-near-nine-year-high;-supply-dwindles-421859,421859

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Best Buy shares have added about 30 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 2  
What s Next for Best Buy 
While Best Buy has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Best Buy was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

166996,388512,BBY,Table For Two  China Renews Trade Talk Hopes  While GDP Meets Expectations,opinion," Thursday Market Open  For the first time in a while  it looks like there s some optimism developing around the trade battle  It s important not to get carried away  though  because we ve been down this road before  where hope for progress eventually gets slammed by an official comment or tweet 
Hope this morning comes from the Chinese side  A spokesman for China s Ministry of Commerce said China firmly rejects escalation of the trade war and is willing to negotiate with a  calm attitude   CNBC reported 

Whether this means getting back to where we were last winter with regular talks and occasional signs of progress remains to be seen  But investors appear to be taking it that way  Stock futures rose 1  before the opening bell Thursday  and bond prices stepped back  The 10 year yield rose to near 1 5   but it s still slightly inverted with the two year yield 
Investors received mixed earnings news this morning  The positive was Dollar General  NYSE DG  beating expectations and raising guidance  sending its shares up more than 8  in pre market trading and providing more signs of strength in the consumer sector  In this case  it s the discount consumer sector  which tends to reflect how middle class Americans are spending their money 

 Best Buy   NYSE BBY  shares fell after the company missed Wall Street s revenue projection and delivered guidance for revenue that was below the third party consensus range  That doesn t mean there wasn t stuff to like  BBY did beat earnings expectations and its revenue miss was pretty slim 

On the data front  the government s second estimate for Q2 gross domestic product was pretty much in line with third party consensus expectations at 2   but down from the first estimate of 2 1   GDP looked pretty good for the most part  but the China news is probably overtaking it as the news of the day  With all the twists and turns  it feels like this is going to be a week of the  news of the day  

A lot more data are on tap as the week and month wrap up  including Personal Consumption Expenditure  PCE  prices  see more below   University of Michigan Sentiment  and Chicago PMI  All those are due tomorrow 
The Chicago PMI number might be particularly interesting  as it fell sharply to 44 4 in July from 49 7 in June  Any number below 50 indicates worsening conditions in Midwest manufacturing  and analysts are expecting another below 50 reading for August  according to Briefing com  If this happens  it could raise new concerns about business confidence 

Don t forget that when the market re opens next Tuesday after Labor Day  another key measure of manufacturing demand the ISM Manufacturing Index will come out that morning  Construction spending also is due that day 
Stocks  Bonds Continue to Decouple
The massive bond rally we re experiencing didn t get in the way of Wednesday s nice upward move for stocks  another sign that the two markets might be decoupling  

In a way  this has been happening all year  Consider that the S P 500  SPX  is up 15  year to date while the benchmark 10 year Treasury yield is down 45   and you ll see there s nothing really new about Wednesday s odd markets  Typically  bonds rise and yields fall when investors are concerned about the economic outlook  while stocks rise when investors are optimistic  Right now  both of those things are happening at the same time  though bonds did retreat a bit early Thursday on the positive trade news 
People appear determined to drive fixed income products higher and drive rates lower  It seems to have taken on a life of its own  There s something kind of odd about it  It seems like it can t be this easy to buy bonds  walk away  and see them go higher every day  Yet that s exactly what s been happening 
Wednesday s bond strength could call into question the conviction behind the stock market s rally on the same day  It was one of those days where stocks went up  but people might need some confirmation of the strength from today s session  What we re seeing in terms of risk premiums suggests that we re going to need a lot more of a run up in stocks for most people to really believe  The SPX remains entrenched in a relatively tight range that extends from roughly 2750 up to 3000  It s been a month since it left that region 
One thing that could make trading particularly difficult is the approaching long weekend  Market volume tends to thin ahead of holidays  which can exacerbate moves to the upside or the downside and can cause some investors to question the market s conviction 
Can Financials  Energy Maintain Wednesday s Strength 
If you want an example of why Wednesday s stock rally as 10 year yields crumbled below 1 5  turned some heads  consider the Financial sector  It was among the leaders on Wall Street despite falling yields  which often can make it harder for financial institutions to book profits  Theoretically  Financials should have been lower on a day like that 
The other thing raising eyebrows is continued strength in other  horsemen of risk  like volatility and gold  The Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  stayed just below 20 on Wednesday  not budging much from levels earlier in the week even as stocks climbed  Gold  meanwhile  slipped by just a couple of dollars an ounce and remains near six year highs  It looks like many investors are keeping their cautious bets both within the bond market and outside of it  VIX did fall sharply early Thursday to just above 18 
The little rally on Wednesday in stocks might have been related to a much higher than expected U S  weekly crude oil draw that gave Energy stocks a boost  It also could have had to do with the fact that yields didn t really test some of the support at 1 35  for the 10 year and 1 9  for the 30 year  It was only one day  so we ll see if those levels continue to hold  Any sign that yields might be carving a bottom would probably be welcomed by stock market bulls 
The other thing to consider is that a few sectors  including Energy and Financials  might be looking cheap to some investors  Both of those got driven down sharply over the last month  with Energy off by double digits and Financials nearly that much  The overall market is only down 4   perhaps making those sectors appear oversold to some  
Crude oil jumped sharply on Wednesday after the U S  supply news  and sometimes a big crude draw can reflect strong industrial demand  There s a lot of concern baked in about business spending right now  so any sign of growing demand for commodities like crude can work against the recession prognostications some analysts are making 

One counterpoint  however  is that some analysts said the drop in oil might reflect a fall in Saudi Arabia s exports  That would make it less of a demand driven drop  Falling gasoline supplies  on the other hand  suggest strong transport demand 





FIGURE 1  NOT DOWN FOR THE COUNT  Two of the most beaten up sectors over the last month Financials  candlestick  and Energy  purple line  both enjoyed a slight bounce on Wednesday  as this three month chart indicates  A big drop in crude supplies appeared to help Energy  but Financials rose despite falling bond yields  Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices   Chart source  the thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results   
Technology as a  Defensive  Investment  When you think of  defensive  sectors  Technology doesn t often come to mind  People tend to consider that a place to invest when they re confident about the economy and stocks are generally on an upswing   Defensive  sectors like Utilities and Staples are where investors tend to go at anxious times like these when they re seeking yield and hoping for stability somewhere  
It could be time to re think that particular philosophy  When you re counting up the things people need every day which Utilities and Staples traditionally represent a lot of it is now also technology related  With this in mind  it s arguable that industries like IT services  software  and semiconductors could hold up well even in a downturn  Those core needs are part of the infrastructure for most companies  and they won t necessarily be able to function without them even in a recession  That means demand could hold firm for technology products no matter what happens to the economy  just as it s supposed to for essentials like shampoo and basic foodstuffs  When you re talking about infrastructure  that is technology  If it s infrastructure  it isn t cyclical it s something you have to have every day  

Eyeball This  Two factors to consider monitoring for signs of economic softness are weekly jobless claims and Q3 earnings growth estimates  analysts told financial media this week  As one analyst said on CNBC Wednesday  jobless claims tend to get overlooked by many investors  but can often be the first indication of things going the wrong direction  Initial claims  released every Thursday  have trended between 210 000 and 230 000 most of this year  If they head up  it could be a sign of businesses starting to feel economic pressure  possibly from the trade war  Any rise in job losses could threaten wage growth and consumer confidence  Claims of 215 000 this morning were up a bit  but in line with the recent range 
The other factor that may be worth a regular look is quarterly earnings estimates  Earlier this month  market research firm FactSet said analysts project a 3 1  year over year decline in Q3 earnings  with revenue growth of 3   The next estimate from FactSet is due tomorrow  so we ll see if anything changed  If earnings estimates remain stable  that s arguably one less potential blow to stocks 

Price Watch  The Fed seems on pace to lower rates next month  according to the futures market  That means tomorrow s Personal Consumption Expenditure  PCE  prices data might not matter all that much from a rate perspective  even though analysts say PCE prices are the Fed s favorite inflation metric  Analysts expect a 0 2  rise in both the headline PCE and core PCE price figures Friday  compared with 0 1  for the June headline number and 0 2  for the June core number  according to Briefing com  In June  year over year PCE prices rose 1 4  and core PCE rose 1 6   both well below the Fed s 2  inflation target  It could be interesting to watch this indicator as we go forward  because U S  tariffs on China might start having an impact on many consumer goods in coming months  The question is whether companies will pass along those price increases  and many have told reporters that they will

166998,388514,BBY,Best Buy Falls On Earnings  Market Cycles Point To Modest Rally,opinion,"Summary
   Best Buy   NYSE BBY  fell by 8  on Thursday  after the company posted mixed earnings compared to Wall Street expectations  
  Based on its market cycles  we believe the stock may face small downside risk before moving modestly higher  


The company reported earnings per share of  1 08 and total revenue of  9 54 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  0 99 and  9 55 billion  Same store sales came in low at 1 6  growth compared to the expectation of 2 1   
Also  CFO Matt Bilunas explained that management was lowering its guidance due in part to  tariffs on goods from China  as well as a shift in consumer buying behavior  
Our approach to stock analysis uses market cycles to project price action  Our analysis is that the stock is in the declining phase of its current cycle  We don t see too much more downside before a forthcoming rally  which is likely to be modest  Our intermediate term target is  68

167069,388585,BBY,Is Best Buy  BBY  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors Now  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Best Buy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 23  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 45  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Best Buy s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 23  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Best Buy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Best Buy stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Best Buy has a P S ratio of about 0 47  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 33 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  BBY is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Best Buy currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Best Buy a solid choice for value investors   What About the Stock Overall    Though Best Buy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives BBY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen eight upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period       This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 2 1  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched up by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Best Buy Co   Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Best Buy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 7  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Consumer Electronics industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be

Samsung and LG Electronics Inc together hold about 40 percent   There was a time when we were going after volume  and we totally lost that race   said Takagi   Even in the days of the Trinitron  we only had a share of around 10 percent  I think 10 percent is appropriate now   RESTRUCTURING Under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai  Sony has shed thousands of jobs and sold off its personal computer  PC  unit after several years of losses  Hirai has not ruled out dispensing with the TV arm as well if it fails to stay profitable  But Takagi said an exit was now less than likely after cost cutting helped the unit book a small operating profit in the last business year  its first in over a decade  Moreover  Sony   with interests ranging from its Hollywood studio to PlayStation videogames   aims to recapture its cachet as an entertainment to electronics group through increased collaboration across the company  Takagi said  TVs encapsulated the sound and picture technology developed by the various businesses  he said  Sony is also aiming for a high end comeback in audio  earlier this year introducing a portable music player that costs over  1000   Historically  TVs have been at the center   Takagi said   When sales rose  sales in audio and home theater rose as well  As the TV operations recover    we ll see a rise in audio sales   Pointing to a revival are Sony s 4K televisions  Last year  Sony quadrupled its share of TV sales at  Best Buy  Co Inc  NYSE BBY   the largest U S  consumer electronics chain  to 12 percent by concentrating on large  high end models  Takagi said  Analyst Hisakazu Torii at DisplaySearch said Japanese TV manufacturers had little choice but to focus on high end models  particularly when faced with a rival like Samsung whose smartphone success has given it overwhelming resources  But 4K TVs already account for nearly 40 percent of sets with screens larger than 50 inches  meaning they were starting to lose exclusivity  he said  Analysts say consumers  particularly in the United States  are increasingly opting for larger sets for their living rooms to watch movies and live events  while opting for PCs and smartphones instead of small bedroom TVs   Once 4K penetration goes beyond 70 percent  that means commoditization and price competition   Torii said  SMARTPHONES Panasonic  on the other hand  has not seen a comparable upturn  and is increasingly out sold by previously little known Chinese manufacturers such as TCL Corp  Its TV division reported seven consecutive years of loss while the overall company turned itself around by focusing on automotive technologies and high margin home appliances  But Masahiro Shinada  head of Panasonic s TV business  said maintaining a presence in television made it easier to sell more profitable white goods   not only by lifting the company s image  but also winning cooperation from retailers who prefer to deal with manufacturers of high volume products such as TVs   They really open the way to selling refrigerators and washing machines   he said  Panasonic  like Sony  is looking to the high end TV market for prestige and profitability  But as consumers increasingly watch content on the go  there is a risk of TVs losing their status as brand defining devices

What s Next for Best Buy

167158,388674,BBY,What s In Store For Western Union  WU  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Western Union Co    NYSE WU   is set to release first quarter 2019 results on May 7 
In the previous quarter  the company reported earnings of 49 cents per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 19 5  year over year  The growth in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to an increase in operating profit margin  a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding  partially offset by lower revenues 
Factors to Affect Q1 Results
Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  earnings per share for the to be reported quarter  is pegged at 42 cents which translates into year over year decline of 6 7   Revenues are expected at  1 3 billion  down 3 13  year over year 
Western Union s Q1 results are likely to benefit from its efforts toward driving digital expansion  offering its cross border platform to new payment areas and generating additional operating efficiencies 
We expect increased contribution from its electronic platform  westernunion com  The company launched nearly 20 new westernunion com or mobile app markets over the last year  particularly in Asia  Latin America and the Middle East  The expansion of services in these regions is expected to drive transaction growth in the company s digital platform 
The company is likely to gain from its WU Way initiative  which is aimed at streamlining its operations and save costs  Under this initiative  in 2018  the company achieved approximately  70 million in run rate savings 
These savings helped to fund investment in growth initiative technology and core sufficiently  such as GDPR  In 2019  the company will have continued to push forward these strategies  which is expected to result in cost savings in the first quarter 
In the Consumer to Consumer segment  we expect to see revenue decline in the MEASA  APAC regions  which should be partly offset by rise in revenues in LACA and EU   CIS regions 
The company s guidance for 2019 calls for a low single digit constant current revenue growth and operating margin of approximately 20   We expect the first quarter of 2019 to reflect the same 
Earnings Surprise History
The company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history  having surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 35   This is depicted in the chart below

167161,388677,BBY,Best Buy  BBY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Best Buy  BBY  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer electronics retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 3  
Revenues are expected to be  9 14 billion  up 0 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 31  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Best Buy 
For Best Buy  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 31  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Best Buy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Best Buy would post earnings of  2 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 72  delivering a surprise of  5 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

167197,388713,BBY,RadioShack may run out of cash by Oct 2015   Moody s,news," Reuters    RadioShack Corp  N RSH  may run out of cash as early as October 2015  giving the struggling electronics retailer little time to turn around its business  a Moody s Investors Service report said 
The company s shares closed down 11 78 percent at 68 cents on Tuesday  increasing concerns over a possible delisting 
 Absent a credible turnaround strategy to improve sales growth and increase earnings  RadioShack will be hard pressed to remain relevant in the increasingly competitive mobile phone and consumer electronics business   Moody s analyst Mickey Chadha said 
RadioShack has posted losses for nine consecutive quarters and it has struggled to shut more than 1 000 stores in the United States in the face of opposition from lenders 
The company s comparable store sales fell 14 percent in the first quarter  as it struggles to compete with rival Best Buy Co Inc  N BBY  and online retailers such as Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  
RadioShack  which started its first retail store in Boston in 1921  has also seen a string of executives leave 
Barring any infusion of cash  RadioShack will run out of liquidity at the end of the its third quarter of fiscal 2015 ending October  Moody s said in a report    
The company s cash balance fell to  62 million at the end of its first quarter in May from  180 million in December 31  2013  the ratings agency said 
Radioshack was not immediately available for comment 
The company said on Friday it had received a warning from the New York Stock Exchange that it could be delisted after its stock closed below  1 00 for more than 30 consecutive trading days 
RadioShack s shares have fallen 71 percent in the last 12 months  They last closed over  1 on the New York Stock Exchange on June 19 

Under NYSE rules  the company has six months following receipt of the notification to regain compliance with the minimum share price requirement

167198,388714,BBY,Corporate founders battle boards to overturn forced exits,news,"By Nadia Damouni NEW YORK  Reuters    From American Apparel Inc  A APP  to Lululemon Athletica Inc  O LULU   Men s Wearhouse Inc  N MW  and Best Buy Co Inc  N BBY   a series of boardroom battles across North America underscore how difficult it can be for companies to part ways with their founders 
In each of these cases  the boards decided it was time for the founders to step down from their roles either as chief executive or chairman  but faced stiff resistance from the founders  some of whom used their substantial equity stakes to fight back 
Corporate governance experts expect more such corporate dramas as shareholders are increasingly holding boards accountable for succession planning  investment returns and overall fiduciary duties  As a result  boards are asserting their authority more frequently  which can put them on collision courses with CEOs  including founders 
 Today s boards are increasingly feeling pressure to anticipate the CEO leadership needed to drive future success  This is especially true when the CEO is the founder of the company   said Jane Stevenson  head of the global CEO succession practice at Korn Ferry International 
 In these situations the board can feel significant conflict between appropriate homage to the past and the leadership needed to drive success in the future  
As many as 42 Fortune 500 companies have founders in CEO positions  according to data compiled by recruitment firm Heidrick   Struggles for Reuters  These founder CEOs have an average tenure of 22 5 years  compared with around six years for non founder CEOs 
 Founders are often the ones that have the  special sauce  that makes a company s offering and culture work  so they might be given additional latitude     as their vision drove value creation in the first place   said Heidrick   Struggles  Vice Chairman John Wood 
American Apparel  under Charney s leadership  was known for its racy advertising and  Made in the USA  sweatshop free model  However  the company has posted losses in almost every quarter in the last four years and came under fire in 2010 for lax financial controls 
In June  the board fired Charney for allegedly misusing corporate funds and helping to spread nude photos of a former employee on the Internet  a source previously told Reuters  The photos were allegedly posted on a blog by another American Apparel employee who was impersonating the former employee 
A spokesman for Charney  Keith Estabrook  said   He was terminated for allegedly failing to prevent the use of impersonating materials  and he did not actively participate  
Charney has denied the allegations and is fighting to regain control of the company  He increased his stake in the apparel retailer to 44 percent  from about 27 percent  but signed over his voting rights and shares to the hedge fund Standard General as collateral for a loan 
Charney intends to have a say over key decisions  such as the makeup of the board or M A deals  whether or not he returns as CEO  a source close to the matter said this week 
American Apparel is waiting for the results of an internal investigation before deciding what to do about its founder  A spokesman for American Apparel declined to comment 
FOUNDERS  SHADOW
In the case of Lululemon  the Canadian yoga apparel chain was once one of the hottest stocks in retail but it suffered a damaging recall last year involving see through yoga pants  Late last year  Chip Wilson  the company s founder  stepped down as non executive chairman to pave the way for new CEO Laurent Potdevin to run the company 
Wilson  however  remained on the board so that directors could tap his knowledge about the company and its customers  The board assured Potdevin that he would be able to run Lululemon without undue influence from Wilson  according to a source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity 
But tensions began to build as some directors felt Wilson wanted to be excessively involved in management decisions  at the same time  Wilson  who has a 27 percent stake in Lululemon  became increasingly frustrated that he was not being fully heard  the source said 
The problems spilled out into the open in June  when Wilson lashed out at the board  saying its new chairman and another director were too focused on short term growth 
A spokesman for Wilson said he had stepped down from management in January 2012 to give then CEO Christine Day the room she wanted to run the company  Lululemon s board then asked Wilson to return from Australia to address a product quality issue  said the spokesman  Jim Courtovich 
 Chip Wilson has always been focused on doing what is in the best interests of Lululemon and its shareholders   Courtovich said   Since then  he has been providing important input that has changed the direction of the company  
A representative for Lululemon declined to comment 
The two sides settled last week  when Wilson agreed not to wage a proxy contest and to sell half his stake to private equity firm Advent International 
Still  shares of Lululemon have fallen more than 40 percent since Potdevin s appointment in December  underscoring the toll such corporate clashes can take on share valuations 
Similar battles between the boards and founders of Men s Wearhouse  Best Buy and Groupon Inc  O GRPN  have rattled their investors until the disagreements were finally settled 
 Numerous times I ve seen first hand how the founder dynamic can be particularly challenging for fellow board members to successfully grapple with  Internal disputes that become public are one of the most dysfunctional events companies face   said Brad Allen  the founder of Branav Shareholder Advisory Services  which counsels boards and shareholders on governance issues  
FOUNDERS AS AN ASSET
To be sure  not all founder departures are acrimonious  Directors and recruiters say many founders have a deep well of knowledge about their companies and customers  and they can be invaluable to their successors 
Former Nielsen Holdings N V   N NLSN  CEO David Calhoun said he used to seek advice from Arthur Nielsen Jr on how to resist pressure from media clients for favorable research  Nielsen Jr is credited with transforming the company  which his father founded in 1923  into a name synonymous with television ratings 
 Art Jr s advice went to the heart of our business  the potential conflict between serving client s needs  the companies we measure  and our commitment to objective measurement   said Calhoun  who is now executive chairman at Nielsen 
Bill Ford had fully supported Alan Mulally when he took over as CEO of Ford Motor Co  N F  in September 2006  said Marshall Goldsmith  an executive coach who has worked with Mulally 
Early in his tenure  when some top executives challenged Mulally s initiative to conduct a weekly review of business priorities  he had the backing of Ford  who helped Mulally implement the plan  The weekly review turned out to be central to the No 2 U S  automaker s successful turnaround  according to Goldsmith 
Goldsmith said his advice to founders is to pick a date to hand off the company and start working on a succession plan 

 Leave with dignity  don t get thrown out   Goldsmith said

167268,388784,BBY,Best Buy  BBY  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Best Buy in Focus
Headquartered in Richfield  Best Buy  BBY  is a Retail Wholesale stock that has seen a price change of  1 93  so far this year  The consumer electronics retailer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 45 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 68   This compares to the Retail   Consumer Electronics industry s yield of 0 12  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 80 is up 32 4  from last year  Best Buy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 23 15   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Best Buy s current payout ratio is 37   meaning it paid out 37  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
BBY is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  5 10 per share  with earnings expected to increase 15 38  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that BBY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-buy-bby-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200358717,200358717
167269,388785,BBY,Best Buy  BBY  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Best Buy  BBY  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer electronics retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9  
Revenues are expected to be  9 54 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 04  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Best Buy 
For Best Buy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Best Buy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Best Buy would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 91  delivering a surprise of  9 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Best Buy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-buy-bby-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200358784,200358784
167271,388787,BBY,Will Best Buy  BBY  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Best Buy  BBY   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Consumer Electronics industry 
This consumer electronics retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9 49  
For the most recent quarter  Best Buy was expected to post earnings of  0 83 per share  but it reported  0 91 per share instead  representing a surprise of 9 64   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 75 per share  while it actually produced  0 82 per share  a surprise of 9 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Best Buy  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Best Buy has an Earnings ESP of  1 48  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 20  2018 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

The pan European STOXX Europe 600 gained 0 24 percent  with every sector in positive territory  Earlier  in Asia  intervention by the People s Bank of China to strengthen the yuan boosted equity prices across regional benchmarks 
Hong Kong s Hang Seng outperformed  leaping 2 17 percent  China s Shanghai Composite edged 1 89 percent higher  Japan s Nikkei 225 gained 0 88 percent  Australia s S P ASX 200 climbed 0 35 percent  while South Korea s KOSPI underperformed  but still managed to inch 0 27 percent higher 
Global Financial Affairs
It seems that the new equity records hit on Friday by the S P 500  the NASDAQ Composite and the Russell 2000 helped by consistent US economic growth data and the most positive earnings season in years have turned traders bullish despite the stalled trade talks between the US and China  The Dow Jones Industrial Average though  whose listed mega cap companies rely on overseas markets for growth  gained ground but remained a bit over 3 percent away from a new record 

Technically  the SPX s record is too near the resistance of the late January record to dismiss opposition  An possible ambush by sellers may be seen in Tuesday s excellent shooting star 

Last week  yields on US 10 year Treasurys slipped below a neckline of a massive complex H S since April  as well as below the 200 DMA  Yields typically fall when demand for the safety provided by government bonds escalates  in a negative correlation to equities  which instead gain ground when investors switch to risk on trade  Investors should keep an eye on this  as well as on the flattening US yield curve 

The dollar bounced back from Friday s slide  even after traders had fully priced in a rate increase next month  Odds of a fourth rate increase in 2018 have decreased  markets are predicting a 60  percent chance of another hike in December  down from near 70 percent last week before the Jackson Hole symposium  Technically  the greenback found support at the bottom of a rising channel since June 
The Mexican peso advanced for a second day driven by reports that a potential NAFTA deal was imminent 
WTI crude is sliding  as the ongoing stalemate in US China trade negotiations weighs on the outlook for global growth  though lingering worries over possible supply glitches stemming from reinstated Iranian sanctions have spared prices from plunging deeper

167286,388802,BBY,Opening Bell  Stocks Rally On Post NAFTA Deal  Dollar Slips,opinion,"US Mexico trade deal boosts global stocks
USD falls below uptrend line and 50 DMA
The S P 500 and NASDAQ hit fresh all time records

Key Events
Equities in Europe gained ground today while futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 meandered  as investors tried to determine the potential impact of the latest developments in global trade  While the news yesterday that the US and Mexico had signed a post NAFTA bilateral trade deal initially seemed to fall short of impressing US investors  futures contracts this morning were edging higher by intraday European trade  pointing to a clearer and broader improvement in market sentiment 
The STOXX Europe 600 opened 0 29 percent higher  with autos climbing for a second day  helped by yesterday s agreement  Earlier  during the Asian session  Australia s S P ASX 200 outperformed regional peers  gaining 0 57 percent  Hong Kong s Hang Seng added 0 28 percent and South Korea s KOSPI ticked 0 17 percent higher 
At the same time  China s Shanghai Composite lagged  retreating 0 1 percent  US President Donald Trump s downbeat remarks on stalled trade talks with China weighed on the mainland index 
Global Financial Affairs
In yesterday s North American session  the S P 500 jumped 0 77 percent  hitting a fresh all time high  with a breakaway gap  closing just below the 2 900 psychological round number and pressuring bears who were holding the line of resistance from last Tuesday s shooting star and January s record 

The next test for the current S P rally would be the key 3 000 level  Financials   1 35 percent  outperformed while Utilities   0 61 percent  took a hit from the investor shift to risk on sentiment 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average leaped 1 01 percent  climbing above the 26 000 level for the first time  also with a breakaway gap  overcoming last week s shooting star and the February peak  The index closed about 2 2 percent below its January record 
The NASDAQ Composite rallied 0 91 percent  topped 8 000 for the first time ever  also on a breakaway gap  clearing the July peak 

However  the Russell 2000 underperformed its US peers  gaining only 0 16 percent  Although it posted a fresh record high and close  technically the small cap index gave up most of its gains  forming a shooting star with a very long upper shadow  suggesting a return move to 1700  toward the ascending triangle it had recently completed 
The decisive US equity breakout demonstrates trader bullishness over the US Mexico deal  after Fed Chair Jerome Powell had already helped investor sentiment on Friday by easing concerns around an accelerated pace of policy tightening  However  lingering uncertainty over the fate of trade negotiations with China  and for that matter Canada  may spoil new found investor confidence and could weigh on commodities going forward 

In FX markets  the dollar index attempted a rebound after falling slightly below the uptrend line since May and the 50DMA  However  it s been forced back down 
The Mexican peso crawled higher on the US Mexico trade breakthrough  The Chinese yuan rebounded after slipping lower on Trump s underwhelming comments on progress with China  The bounce back was probably sparked by dip buyers  who took advantage of the latest move by the People s Bank of China to strengthen the daily fix against the greenback by the most significant level in more than 14 months 
The Turkish lira extended its decline when the domestic stock market reopened after a bank holiday 

Meanwhile  Bitcoin inched higher for the fourth consecutive session  but failed to hold onto more significant gains  finding resistance in the convergence of the 50 DMA  green  and 100 DMA  blue   Note  however  that the 100DMA just slipped below the 50 DMA  as longer price averages are lower than shorter statistical sets  signaling a higher emphasis on recent price developments  Technical traders consider this a buy signal 
Oil fell below  69 a barrel  fluctuating within a 0 6 percent range  as it failed to overcome Friday s  69 31 high for a second day  Gold has been moving higher  up 0 27  at time of writing  Traders of the precious metal have noticed what appears to be a surprising new correlation trend for the yellow metal

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  June 14  Reuters    U S  stocks rose in early
trading on Tuesday after Chinese economic data drew investors
into an equities market that has been through six weeks of
sharp declines 
 U S  retail sales declined  though less than forecast 
giving a further boost to equities and some respite to
investors overwhelmed by recent weak economic data  For
details  see  ID nN14189765 
  The consumer isn t dead   said Michael Farr  president of
investment management firm Farr  Miller   Washington in
Washington   I question the sustainability  given the high
levels of debt that consumers hold and the unemployment rate 
But we don t want to look a gift horse in the mouth  It s good
news for the day  
 The S P retail index  edged up 1 3 percent 
 Despite the sharp gains  some investors were still focused
on a retreat in the S P 500 index to its March low near the
1 250 level  The S P closed flat on Monday after hitting a near
three month low last Friday 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  added 94 49 points 
or 0 79 percent  to 12 047 46  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
 gained 12 59 points  or 0 99 percent  to 1 284 42  The
Nasdaq Composite Index  rose 26 60 points  or 1 01
percent  to 2 666 29 
 The S P 500 is down more than 7 percent from its high in
early May as soft data sparked worries about the sustainability
of the economic recovery 
  I think we re seeing a dead cat bounce  on the equities
market    Farr said   It could take time before the market
finds a new bottom  
 Inflation is still a concern in China after data showed
consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in almost three
years  but industrial output grew 13 3 percent from a year ago 
in line with forecasts 
 China s central bank later increased the reserve
requirement ratio for commercial lenders by 50 basis points 
 ID nL3E7HE05P 
 The Chinese output data helped boost metals prices  lifting
mining and industrial shares  Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold
Inc  gained 1 4 percent to  49 01  while Caterpillar Inc
 rose 1 percent to  96 38 
  News out of China is somewhat encouraging in spite of the
fact they raised reserve requirements   said Peter Cardillo 
chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York  He said
the data is a sign that perhaps China s economy  can avoid a
hard landing  and that s cheering the markets  
  The real focus will be on the fact that the market is in a
technical correction   Cardillo said   we have options
expiration this week  so any rallies might continue to be
short lived  
 Options expiration alters the market regardless of
fundamentals as traders and investors try to  pin   or lock in
the S P 500 at a preset level to make their bets more
profitable 
 Best Buy Co Inc  beat quarterly profit and sales
estimates on strong demand for mobile phones  calling plans and
tablet computers  Its shares rose 7 percent to  30 85

167304,388820,BBY,Is Best Buy Co   BBY  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Best Buy Co  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Best Buy Co  s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 13 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 31 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Best Buy Co  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Best Buy Co  s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Best Buy Co  has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Best Buy Co  currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BBY a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Best Buy Co  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives BBY a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate did not witness any earnings movement in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Best Buy Co   Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBest Buy Co  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 42  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-06-17,Zacks Investment

167326,388842,BBY,GLOBAL MARKETS Strong U S  retail data boosts stocks  oil,news,"  Better than expected US retail sales boost risk appetite
  Disappointing earnings results curb U S  stock gains
  Dollar  Treasuries fall as safe haven appeal dimmed
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK  Sept 15  Reuters    Surprisingly strong U S 
retail sales spurred renewed appetite for risk on Tuesday 
driving up U S  and European stocks and the price of oil  as
the data raised hopes of a steady recovery from recession 
 U S  retail sales jumped 2 7 percent in August  the fastest
pace in three and a half years and outpacing expectations for a
2 0 percent rise  For details  see  ID nN14478930  
 U S  consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of the
economy 
  The retail sales number shows more strength for consumers
than we were thinking   said Peter Kenny  managing director at
Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City   The numbers are good for
the market  
 Data showing that New York State manufacturing activity hit
a near two year high and a report showing prices received by
U S  producers rose faster than expected last month also fueled
investor optimism about the economy 
 Federal Reserve Chairman  speaking at the Brookings
Institution in Washington  D C   on the one year anniversary of
the collapse of Lehman Brothers  said the U S  recession  is
very likely over  
 Stock market gains in New York were tempered by
disappointing quarterly results from electronics chain Best Buy
Co Inc  and reports by some big financial companies of
rising credit card delinquencies 
  The retail sales data is another positive for those
looking for an economic rebound  but the defaults are a wake up
call for those expecting a V shaped recovery   said Elliot
Spar  options market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus   Co in
Shrewsbury  New Jersey

 NEW YORK  Sept 15  Reuters    Surprisingly robust U S 
retail sales stoked investors  appetite for risk on Tuesday 
driving up stocks and oil prices while supporting comments from
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the U S  recession is likely
over 
 The strong data reduced the safe haven appeal of Treasuries
and the dollar  pulling yields of U S  government debt back
from two month lows and sending the greenback lower against
other major currencies 
 U S  retail sales jumped 2 7 percent in August  the fastest
pace of growth in 3 1 2 years and outpacing analysts 
expectations for a 2 0 percent rise  For details  see

 U S  consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of the
economy 
  The retail sales number shows more strength for consumers
than we were thinking   said Peter Kenny  managing director at
Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City  New Jersey   The numbers
are good for the market  
 Data showing that New York state manufacturing activity
touched a near two year high and a report showing prices
received by U S  producers rose faster than expected last month
also fueled investor optimism about the economy 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  speaking at the
Brookings Institution in Washington  on the anniversary of the
collapse of Lehman Brothers  said the U S  recession  is very
likely over    ID nN1523355 
 Stock market gains in New York were tempered by
disappointing quarterly results from electronics retail chain
Best Buy Co Inc  as well as reports by some big
financial firms of rising credit card delinquencies 
  The retail sales data is another positive for those
looking for an economic rebound  but the defaults are a wake up
call for those expecting a V shaped recovery   said Elliot
Spar  options market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus   Co in
Shrewsbury  New Jersey

comments

 DOLLAR  TREASURIES PRICES DOWN
 Meanwhile  Treasury debt prices and the U S  dollar
weakened as the gains in global stock markets reduced their
traditional appeal as a safe haven

167330,388846,BBY,Kirkland s Cheer Store   E commerce Growth  High Costs A Woe,opinion,"Kirkland s  Inc    NASDAQ KIRK   well knit strategic endeavors to boost sales have been yielding positively  evident from consistent year over year improvement in top line for almost nine straight quarters  The company has been gaining from its efforts to enhance merchandise assortments  develop e commerce business and constant store additions 
Such robust initiatives combined with a positive sales view boosts investors  optimism in this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  The company s shares have gained 15 3  in the past three months compared with the  s rise of 1 9  
In spite of such upsides  Kirkland s struggles with weak bottom line performance  primarily stemming from higher operating costs 
That said  let s get a closer glimpse of these factors impacting the performance this retailer of home decor products 
Initiatives to Drive Sales Bode Well 
Kirkland s effective merchandising efforts has been one of the factors boosting store sales  Additionally  rationalizing SKUs  undertaking repairs at various categories and enhancing pricing as well as mix to enhance overall execution also benefit performance  Notably  these factors combined with solid comps drove fourth quarter fiscal 2017 net sales 

 
Further  Kirkland s gains from a robust e commerce business  Incidentally  the company redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution   The special order program  also enables customers to choose from various styles of seats and benches that are not offered usually in its stores 
Additionally  the launch of third party drop shipping in fiscal 2015 gave customers a wider assortment of product offerings  These efforts have been yielding significant results  evident from the strong e commerce momentum witnessed of late  In fourth quarter fiscal 2017  e commerce sales surged 30  year over year and represented about 10  of Kirkland s top line 
This came on the back of constant focus on enhancing omni channel business  online product range and fulfilment operations  In the near term  the company is expected to continue expanding its third party partnerships  improve  buy online pick up in store  capability and refine its fulfillment processes to increase the profitability of the Ship to Home business 
Kirkland s also undertakes frequent store openings to support its top line growth  In this respect  the company resorts to the strategy of opening stores at popular locations  while shuttering smaller underperforming stores  During fiscal 2017  Kirkland s opened 31 stores while shutting 17  This included five store openings and two closures in the fourth quarter  For fiscal 2018  management intends to open 20 25 new stores and close 10 15 stores 
Going ahead  management is committed toward making several experiments to attract more customers   online and in stores  That said  Kirkland s anticipates net sales in fiscal 2018 to advance 3 5   owing to increased store count and contributions from e commerce sales  Also  this guidance is based on comps growth of 1 2  
Higher Costs a Concern 
Higher promotional spending  stemming from consumers  accelerated changes in shopping patterns has been weighing on Kirkland s bottom line  as witnessed during the latter half of the fourth quarter  Apart from this  higher store occupancy costs and outbound freight costs have also been a drag on profitability 
These factors led to a surge of 60 basis points  bps  in operating costs during the fourth quarter  while operating margin shrank 190 bps   Persistence of higher operating expenses is a considerable threat to Kirkland s profitability in the forthcoming periods  While Kirkland s initiatives to improve sales are encouraging  it is yet to be seen if such growth plans can counter ongoing hurdles

   Shares up 2 percent  outperforming flat UK midcaps
 
  Adds UK data  updates shares 
 By Mark Potter
 LONDON  July 23  Reuters    Europe s biggest mobile phone
retailer  Carphone Warehouse  added to signs the worst may be
over for retailers by meeting or beating first quarter revenue
and customer growth forecasts 
 The British firm said it was on track to meet its full year
targets and aimed to split its TalkTalk telecoms business from
its Best Buy Europe retail venture in March 
 Consumer markets appear to be experiencing a period of
 prolonged stability   Chief Financial Officer Roger Taylor told
Reuters   I m more optimistic we re not going to go into a
further downturn   
 Taylor said it was too early to say consumer demand was
recovering  although Carphone  which has over 2 400 stores
across nine countries  had seen strong demand for Apple s new
iPhone in recent weeks 
 Taylor s comments chime with upbeat statements from fashion
chain Next and grocer Morrison  which said on Tuesday they would
beat profit forecasts  
 Home improvements firm Kingfisher also beat quarterly sales
forecasts on Thursday 
 British retail sales data for June on Thursday also showed a
bigger than expected 1 2 percent increase in volumes from May 
helped by warm weather and discounting 
 Carphone said TalkTalk revenue fell 2 percent year on year
to 340 million pounds   557 million  in the three months ended
June 
 It added a net 47 000 new broadband customers  beating
analysts  average forecast of 37 000 in a company poll 
 Revenue at Best Buy Europe  Carphone s joint venture with
U S  electricals retailer Best Buy  were 773 million pounds  up
0 7 percent on a constant currency basis and beating analysts 
average forecast of 758 million 
  A solid quarter     slightly ahead of expectations   was
the conclusion of Credit Suisse analysts in a research note 
 At 0940 GMT  Carphone shares were up 2 percent at 169 25
pence  valuing the firm at about 1 5 billion pounds  The stock
lost three quarters of its value last year as the recession took
hold  but has since bounced back from a low of 82 5 pence 
 
 SPLITTING IN TWO
 Carphone believes its two businesses will be valued more
highly by investors if separated and said in June it planned to
complete the demerger by July 2010 
 Taylor said he was  pretty optimistic  the demerger could
take place next March  as Best Buy Europe had agreed a new 350
million pound banking facility  which was a key precondition 
 The firm sold a 50 percent stake in its retail business to
U S  electrical goods group Best Buy last year and the resulting
venture  Best Buy Europe  plans to roll out a new chain of
electrical goods stores across Europe  starting in Britain next
year 
 Taylor said the venture had signed leases for two stores and
was close to signing another three  It had also identified 10
more sites for opening later next year  he said 
 Carphone is also Britain s biggest provider of residential
broadband after its 236 million pound purchase of Tiscali UK 
which completed earlier this month 
 Taylor said the firm planned to announce a decision in
October on whether it would become a television operator by
expanding the Tiscali TV service 
 Carphone said it was on track to meet its full year
financial targets  which include generating over 150 million
pounds in free cash flow and delivering earnings per share
growth of 10 percent  including the Tiscali deal 
   1  6103 pounds

 NEW YORK  Aug 10  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Monday 
led by retailers  as investors booked profits following a
four week rally  though losses were limited by strong July
sales at McDonald s Corp 
 The decline came after a sharp advance in Friday s
session  when better than expected July employment data pushed
the S P 500 to a 10 month high 
  I think the move today is a Monday hangover from the big
move last week   said Michael James  senior trader at Wedbush
Morgan in Los Angeles   Given the significant strength we ve
seen over the last several weeks  to see a little bit of a
 pullback  isn t unexpected  
 The retail group was a weak performer in Monday s session 
falling after Goldman Sachs downgraded Best Buy to  neutral  
 Best Buy shares shed 5 5 percent to  37 58 while the S P
Retail index dropped 2 5 percent to 363 44 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 64 69 points  or

1 983 50 
 Earlier  the Dow hit a session high at 9 371 96  less than
2 points above Friday s close 
 The brief stay in positive territory came as McDonald s
reported stronger than expected July sales  sending the Dow
component s stock up 1 8 percent to  56 20 
  Because the results were clearly better than expected 
you re seeing a relief rally there   James said   Plus 
McDonald s has been one of the weaker restaurant names over
the past few weeks  
 Fellow Dow component Wal Mart inched down 0 1 percent to
 49 22 after JPMorgan said the discount retailer wouldn t post
any growth in second quarter same store sales 
 The Class B shares of Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc fell 5percent to  3 362 99 after it reported
second quarter earnings that missed expectations late Friday

years 
 Elsewhere  Hormel Foods climbed 6 6 percent to  38 52

 Investors will keep hunting for signs of economic

167361,388877,BBY,Is First Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF  RDVY  A Hot ETF Right Now ,opinion,"Launched on 01 07 2014  the First Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF  RDVY  is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U S  equity market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
For a long time now  the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes  which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment 
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency  market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns 
On the other hand  some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non cap weighted strategies  popularly known as smart beta 
Based on specific fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such  these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance 
This area offers many different investment choices  such as simplest equal weighting  fundamental weighting and volatility momentum based weighting methodologies  however  not all of these strategies can deliver superior results 
Fund Sponsor   Index
RDVY is managed by First Trust Advisors  and this fund has amassed over  488 72 M  which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs  This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ US Rising Dividend Achievers Index before fees and expenses 
The Index is designed to provide access to a diversified portfolio of companies with a history of paying dividends 
Cost   Other Expenses
When considering an ETF s total return  expense ratios are an important factor  And  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 50   making it one of the more expensive products in the space 
RDVY s 12 month trailing dividend yield is 1 33  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF s holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
Representing 29 50  of the portfolio  the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector  Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Valero Energy Corporation  NYSE VLO  accounts for about 2 50  of total assets  followed by Best Buy Co   Inc   NYSE BBY  and Automatic Data Processing  Inc   ADP  
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 22 2  of RDVY s total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
So far this year  the ETF return is roughly 2 25   and is up about 17 05  in the last one year  as of 05 18 2018   RDVY has traded between  26 49 and  31 88 in the past 52 week period 
The ETF has a beta of 1 01 and standard deviation of 15 17  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium choice in the space  With about 50 holdings  it has more concentrated exposure than peers 
Alternatives
First Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market  There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well 
IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF  IWD  tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF  VTV  tracks CRSP U S  Large Cap Value Index  IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has  36 69 B in assets  Vanguard Value ETF has  36 28 B  IWD has an expense ratio of 0 20  and VTV charges 0 05  
Investors looking for cheaper and lower risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs

 NEW YORK  June 16  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Tuesday
as mixed economic data spurred worries of an anemic economic
recovery and Best Buy s disappointing results signaled consumer
spending remains weak 
 While a rebound in May housing starts pointed to some
stabilization in that sector  another government report showed
industrial production logged a steeper than expected slide last
month 
 Industrial production fell 1 1 percent in May  while
capacity utilization  a measure of slack in the U S  economy 
slumped to its lowest level on records dating back to 1967 
 After a three month run that lifted the S P 500 by as much
as 40 percent from 12 year lows  analysts said the economy
needs to start showing real recovery to support market gains 
  We re 40 percent off the low  but we re still 40 percent
off the high  so the market s at the turning point  It needs to
see more evidence that the economy is firmly in recovery mode
and that corporate earnings are going to be guided higher over
the second half   said John Canally  economist at LPL Financial
in Boston 
 Best Buy Co Inc  the largest U S  consumer electronics
retailer  posted a slide in same store sales in its first
quarter  a key measure of retail performance  and its shares
dropped 7 4 percent to  35 78 
 The sales suggested consumers continue to curb spending on
discretionary purchases  The S P retail index tumbled 3 2
percent

percent  to 8 517 82  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index lost
12 02 points  or 1 30 percent  to 911 70  The Nasdaq Composite
Index slipped 19 30 points  or 1 06 percent  to 1 797 08 
 In other economic data  a smaller than expected rise in
May producer prices suggested inflation pressures were muted 
 Big industrial manufacturers  whose fortunes are closely
tied to a growing economy  fell  with blue chip 3M Co down 1 5
percent at  58 44 
 The broad S P 500 is still up nearly 35 percent from the

  Updates to close 
 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK  June 16  Reuters    U S  stocks slipped on
Tuesday as mixed economic data and Best Buy s disappointing
sales spurred worries about an anemic recovery 
 After a three month run that lifted the S P 500 as much as
40 percent from 12 year lows  analysts said the economy needs
to start showing real improvement to support optimism about a
budding recovery 
 A rebound in May housing starts pointed to some
stabilization in that sector  but another government report
showed industrial production had a steeper than expected slide
last month 
 Industrial production fell 1 1 percent in May  while
capacity utilization  a measure of slack in the U S  economy 
slumped to its lowest level on records dating back to 1967 
  It indicates that at a minimum  the market s taking a
breather and may be starting a meaningful correction   said  
Hugh Johnson  chief investment officer of Johnson Illington
Advisors in Albany  New York  concerning the market s losses 
  The worry is we ve gone too far too fast and that we ve
overstated the strength of a recovery in the economy and
earnings  
 Best Buy Co Inc  the largest U S  consumer electronics
retailer  posted weaker than expected sales in its first
quarter and suggested earnings for the rest of the year would
be worse than forecast  Its shares dropped 7 3 percent to
 35 84  The S P retail index tumbled 3 1 percent 
 Indexes ended at session lows  The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 107 46 points  or 1 25 percent  to 8 504 67  The
Standard   Poor s 500 Index lost 11 75 points  or 1 27
percent  to 911 97  The Nasdaq Composite Index was off 20 20
points  or 1 11 percent  to 1 796 18 
 The S P 500 is still up 34 8 percent from March s 12 year
closing low  Declines have been shallow and short lived  but
analysts are increasingly looking for a larger pullback 
 Johnson said he expects a correction of around 10
percent 
 Consumer discretionary and resource stocks were among the
 day s biggest losers  After earlier boosting the market 
materials and energy shares fell as the U S  dollar
strengthened  Chevron was down 1 7 percent at  69 88 
 Single family housing starts rose 7 5 percent in May  the
largest gain since January 2006  but analysts said that rising
mortgage rates and high inventory are still headwinds for the
sector at the heart of the financial crisis 
 In other economic data  a smaller than expected rise in
May s overall Producer Price Index suggested inflation
pressures were muted 
 Shares of big industrial manufacturers  whose fortunes are
closely tied to a growing economy  fell  with blue chip 3M Co
 down 1 5 percent at  58 41 
 Trading volume was modest on the New York Stock Exchange 
where about 1 18 billion shares changed hands  below last
year s estimated daily average of 1 49 billion  On the Nasdaq 
about 2 26 billion shares traded  below last year s daily
average of 2 28 billion 
  Decliners far outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2 160
to 848  while on the Nasdaq  decliners outran advancers by
1 876 to 753

   Lingering questions on recovery s sustainability
 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG  June 17  Reuters    Asian stocks outside Japan
fell for a fourth day on Wednesday  weighed by resource related
shares and doubts about a global economic recovery  while U S 
Treasuries eased on profit taking after a surge overnight 
 Japan s Nikkei share average outperformed the region 
rising 0 9 percent on bargain hunting after a sharp drop on
Tuesday and a shift into defensive sectors 
 Major European stock market opened slightly weaker  with
the pan European FTSEurofirst 300 dipping 0 5 percent  although
Wall Street futures were actually up 0 4 percent 
 Oil prices advanced after bouncing off  70 a barrel for a
third day  convincing dealers that crude would have difficulty
falling much below  70 if the dollar continued to weaken 
 Several U S  economic indicators this week have come in
below expectations  raising fears that investors may have
pushed up equity and commodity prices too far  too quickly 
However  the corrective move lower in equity and commodity
prices has been tame  so far 
  The market seems to be bewildered  facing lots of
different factors   said Kazuyuki Kato  treasury department
manager at Mizuho Trust and Banking in Tokyo   And investors
are shying away from taking risks after stocks entered a
correction phase as optimism for the economy had gone too far  
he said 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan fell
0 8 percent and looked set for its fourth consecutive day of
losses  The index has now fallen 5 6 percent from an
eight month high reached two weeks ago 
 The materials sector had continued to climb after the broad
market began to drift lower after June 3  but along with the
energy sector this week has been leading the region lower 
 Australian shares fell 1 5 percent to the lowest close
since June 1  led by miner BHP Billiton and bank stocks 
 U S  markets fell more than 1 percent overnight as mixed
economic data and disappointing sales by top U S  consumer
electronic retailer Best Buy spurred worries about an anaemic
recovery 
 The uncertain global economic outlook has made some
investors convictionless  as they dance through trendless
markets  but other investors are sticking to their guns 
  We ll have corrections along the way  but it s not a
situation in which we have nothing to buy   said Mark Mobius 
who manages around  24 billion in emerging market assets with
Templeton Asset Management 
  Given the quantity of money being printed all over the
world with the stimulus packages  equities are definitely going
to be moving up   he said in an interview in Vienna 
 Mobius said he was finding value in Russian and eastern
European shares 
 BRIC MUM ON DOLLAR
 Meanwhile  the U S  dollar slid against the euro  which
rose 0 55 percent to  1 3908 in thin trade 
 Dealers did not spot any trends  but said covering of bets
against the euro were largely dominating trade 
 Brazil  Russia  India and China after a first summit
together issued a joint statement that did not mention any
doubts about the dollar s role as the primary reserve currency 
effectively removing that issue as an uncertainty for the
market 
 The dollar had been under some pressure heading into the
summit on fears that Russia  which has publicly made clear it
wants to have new world reserve currencies  would coax China
into bashing the dollar together 
 Besides headlines about the U S  dollar s global reserve
role  perceptions on risk expressed through equity markets have
also been a driver  Fears that price increases have run ahead
of fundamentals  particularly with earnings estimates for 2010
in the double digits  have weighed on global stocks 
  That is a similar picture of markets around the globe and
quite appropriately so  given we are in the midst of a
reassessment of expectations for the global economy    about
which there is little more agreement than that challenges lie
ahead   said Patrick Bennett  Asia foreign exchange and rates
strategist with Societe Generale in Hong Kong in a note 
 Commodity markets have been very sensitive to this notion 
 U S  crude oil futures rose above  71 a barrel  snapping a
three day losing streak as the dollar slid  The July contract
was up 0 9 percent to  71 10 a barrel after touching a session
low of  69 91 earlier 
 The American Petroleum Institute data showed late on
Tuesday that U S  crude stocks fell by a smaller than expected
1 3 million barrels last week  The U S  Energy Information
Administration will release its inventory data later in the
day 
 The Reuters Jefferies CRB index  a basket of 19 commodity
futures  has slipped about 4 percent from a seven month high
reached last Thursday  It was still up 15 percent since the end
of April 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury yield ticked up to 3 69
percent after tumbling to 3 66 percent late on Tuesday in New
York  After climbing to an eight month high of 4 percent on
Thursday  the 10 year yield has come off sharply as investors
bought back higher yielding bonds as doubts about the recovery
pile up

 LONDON  June 17  Reuters    World stocks slid for the fourth
day on Wednesday as investors grew sceptical that the speed of
the global economic recovery would match the sort of financial
market optimism that has fuelled a 40 percent rally in the
second quarter so far 
 Mining stocks led the losses in Europe as commodity prices
also showed some reversal 
 Doubts about the heralded global economic recovery are
starting to weigh on sentiment everywhere after some U S 
economic indicators this week came in below expectations 
raising fears that investors may have pushed up equity and
commodity prices too quickly 
 Stock corrections have been relatively tame so far but they
have taken world stocks as well as emerging equities down to
three week lows 
  We ve had a very good run from the March lows  The market
was losing momentum and getting ready for some form of
correction   said Bernard McAlinden  strategist at NCB
Sctockbrokers 
 A positive investor sentiment reading on Tuesday in Europe s
biggest economy  Germany  was overshadowed by poor industrial
output data in the United States and disappointing sales by top
U S  retailer Best Buy which spurred worries about an anaemic
recovery and pushed Wall Street down over one percent 
  We seem to be stuck in a negative mode now  and we re well
down on levels seen last week   said Peter Dixon  economist at
Commerzbank   Some of the hype on the recovery seems to have
faded and we seem to be returning to realism  
 By 1130 GMT  the pan European FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 3
percent  with miners such as Anglo American and Rio Tinto
leading the losses  Spanish utility Iberdola and British grocer
J Sainsbury  both of which announced share issue plans  also
fell 
 The Reuters Jefferies CRB index  a basket of 19 commodity
futures  eased further  having slipped about 4 percent from a
seven month high reached last Thursday  
 It is still up 15 percent since the end of April 
 Wall Street s VIX volatility index    a measure of risk   
has risen to a three week high above 30  Although the backup in
the VIX is partly related to a series of options expiries this
week  rising volatility will dampen demand for relatively risky
assets such as equity and emerging markets in particular 
 Oil ebbed about one percent on Wednesday to below  70 per
barrel as the dollar steadied following recent losses    partly
on concern about a fresh equity market nosedive 
 
 DOLLAR

 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON  June 17  Reuters    European shares slid for the
fourth day on Wednesday  echoing falls across most of Asia as
some investors unwound trades betting on a speedy economic
recovery  while dollar weakness boosted oil towards  71 a
barrel 
 Mining stocks led the losses in Europe but doubts about the
heralded global economic recovery are weighing on sentiment
worldwide after several U S  economic indicators this week came
in below expectations  raising fears that investors may have
pushed up equity and commodity prices too quickly  
 Stock corrections have been relatively tame so far but they
have taken world stocks as well as emerging equities down to
three week lows  Both indexes have risen about 40 percent and 70
percent respectively off their March troughs as investors bet on
a speedy economic recovery 
 A positive investor sentiment reading on Tuesday in Europe s
biggest economy  Germany  was overshadowed by poor economic data
in the United States and disappointing sales by top U S 
retailer Best Buy which spurred worries about an anaemic
recovery and pushed Wall Street down over one percent 
  We seem to be stuck in a negative mode now  and we re well
down on levels seen last week   said Peter Dixon  economist at
Commerzbank   Some of the hype on the recovery seems to have
faded and we seem to be returning to realism  
 By 0830 GMT  the pan European FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0 8
percent  with miners such as Anglo American and Rio Tinto
leading the losses  Spanish utility Iberdola and British grocer
J Sainsbury  both of which announced share issue plans  also
fell 
 The Reuters Jefferies CRB index  a basket of 19 commodity
futures  eased further  having slipped about 4 percent from a
seven month high reached last Thursday  
 It is still up 15 percent since the end of April 
 Wall Street s VIX volatility index    a measure of risk   
has risen to a three week high above 30 
 Oil gained on Wednesday as dealers remain convinced that
crude will not fall much below  70 if the dollar continues to
weaken  Also  data expected at 1430 GMT is expected to show a
large fall in crude stocks in the United States 
  A further fall in crude stocks is helping the more bullish
picture for oil  I think the draws in crude stocks is more
important  than U S  dollar weakness    Bache Commodities broker
Christopher Bellew said 
 Oil has however eased from last week s high above  73 per
barrel as investors question whether the world economy is
recovering at a fast enough pace to justify the doubling in oil
prices since February 
 
 DOLLAR
 The dollar continues on the back foot after leaders of the
emerging BRICs nations    Brazil  Russia  India and China    at
a summit on Tuesday underlined the need for a more diversified
monetary system 
 The summit communique made no mention of support for a
smaller role for the dollar  giving some relief to the greenback
on Tuesday but the status of the dollar s role as the main
reserve currency remains in focus 
  The BRICs were asking for a more diverse monetary system 
that would explain some of the dollar weakness   Martin McMahon 
currency strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich said 
 The dollar index fell for the second consecutive day though
losses were limited by a slide in European shares  which
tempered demand for risk  By 0756 GMT  the euro was up 0 5
percent at  1 3912  after rising as high as around  1 3925 
 The dollar index was down 0 2 percent  while the U S 
currency was little changed against the yen at 96 40 yen 
 Markets are awaiting May consumer prices data in the United
States and are bracing for next week s Federal Reserve meeting 
 U S  stock futures slid 1 2 percent  heralding a weak
opening in New York 
 Bond investors were starting to retreat to the sidelines
ahead of the Fed meeting  taking profits off a four day rise in
U S  Treasury prices  The recent risk reversal had caused yields
on benchmark 10 year Treasuries    now at 3 68 percent    to
rise as far as 4 percent last week 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury was down 8 32 in price
to yield 3 6802 while the two year note ticked down 1 32 to
1 1996 percent

167394,388910,BBY,COLUMN Sweet deal for Bain but GOME founder looms large  Wei Gu,news,"   Wei Gu is a Reuters columnist  The opinions expressed are her
own   
 
 By Wei Gu
 HONG KONG  June 23  Reuters    Bain Capital seems to have
struck a very lucrative deal with GOME if the jump in the
troubled Chinese electronics retailer s share price is anything
to go by  But it is also a risky one  given that it does not
confer control and ties the U S  private equity firm in as a
partner of GOME s main shareholder 
 GOME s stock was suspended on Nov  24 after reports that
ex chairman  founder and top shareholder Huang Guangyu was under
investigation for alleged financial irregularities 
 Why would a private equity firm take such a gamble  Not only
is Huang    one of China s richest and best connected
businessmen    under investigation  but he disappeared last
November and has not been seen since  The new chairman says that
he does not know where Huang is 
 The answer is that it s a calculated gamble  Bain and other
private equity firms pursued the retailer because GOME
Electrical Appliances  known as China s Best Buy  has a lot of
potential despite its recent difficulties  which also include a
liquidity squeeze 
 It is a play on the rising spending power of China s
emerging middle class  GOME is the trusted low price vendor for
things like digital cameras and flat screen TVs as its retail
network  the largest in China  gives it massive pricing power 
 Foreign investors aren t popular in China now because they
are perceived to have made a lot of money from stakes in local
banks without doing much to earn it  This means opportunities to
buy good sized assets are few and far between 
 Just to get a shot at GOME  Bain had to go through a
competitive auction  And one of the reasons it was selected over
rival bidders  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Warburg Pincus  was
that Bain is willing to play second fiddle  It will end up
owning up to 23 5 percent of GOME  depending on how many shares
it purchases through GOME s new offering  which Bain is
underwriting  Huang will still control at least 25 3 percent
shares after the dilution 
 Bain has structured the deal carefully to protect itself  Of
the up to  447 million it is investing   233 million is in the
form of a seven year convertible bond which they can put back on
GOME after five years  Those convertibles  exercise price is
about 40 percent below GOME s Thursday close  The shares are
convertible a month after they are issued 
 Bain is putting up the rest of the money by underwriting a
new share offering that will be offered back to GOME s own
shareholders  Huang as a shareholder will have the right to
subscribe to the offering  but his assets might have been frozen
by the government 
 Even after the big run up on Tuesday  GOME is trading at
about 12 times next year s earnings  lower than its smaller
rival Suning Appliance s valuation of 28 times  But GOME is
cheap for a reason 
 Years of overexpansion have led to thin margins and dozens
of loss making stores  It is hard to argue that the brand has
not been tarnished by Huang s disappearance  and the bank s
unwillingness to extend further credit  The damage could be seen
in the first quarter when GOME s profit fell 37 percent while
sales contracted 20 percent 
 Top managers at China s state owned banks routinely play
musical chairs and can be investigated without raising eyebrows 
with stock prices barely moving on the news  But GOME is a
private company  and Huang almost has a godfather status 
 After the deal with Bain Capital and rights issue  GOME
should have no near term liquidity worries  but big challenges
remain for Bain  Private equity firms usually make money by
sending capable managers who turn around the business quickly 
but in this case Bain is reliant on GOME s management 
 The new team is not related to Huang  but the ex chairman
still looms large through his majority holding and the plan to
transfer more than 400 stores from the unlisted parent company 
which he wholly owns  to the listed company by 2011 
 True  Bain will be entitled to three non executive positions
on the board  but that won t give it management control  Bain
may be willing to take the risk because its China head Jonathan
Zhu has been eager to pull off a big deal since he joined two
years ago from Morgan Stanley where he was country head 
 This investment may yield a big reward  But by no stretch of
the imagination can it be called riskless  In a more difficult
environment  with credit still constrained in western countries 
it suggests that getting into China is a high priority for
private equity firms

same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to

167411,388927,BBY,UPDATE 4 Kingfisher hit by outlook fear  to shrink in China,news,"  To close 22  downsize 17 Chinese stores
   Underlying profit 368 million sterling vs 364 million
forecast
   CEO comfortable with 2009 10 forecasts for a profit fall
  To cut capex  working capital  reduce UK costs
   Shares fall as much as 5 7 percent
 
  Adds more company comment  updates shares 
 By Mark Potter
 LONDON  March 26  Reuters    Kingfisher  Europe s top home
improvements retailer  plans to close a third of its loss making
Chinese stores and said it expected group profit to fall this
year as the global recession takes hold 
 Shares in the firm  which runs market leaders B Q in Britain
and Castorama in France  fell as much as 5 7 percent to 134 2
pence on Thursday  unwinding some recent outperformance against
rivals on high hopes for its turnaround strategy 
 The world s third biggest home improvements group  which met
forecasts with a 3 1 percent rise in annual profit  said it
would take further steps to mitigate tough trading by reducing
investment  working capital and costs 
  We re assuming difficult markets and focusing on the self
help   Chief Executive Ian Cheshire told reporters  
  I would hope things are trading better by the end of the
year  but we re not going to assume any quick uplift  
 Some analysts said Kingfisher s shares  which have beaten
the DJ Stoxx European retail index by almost 30 percent over the
past year  did not reflect the challenges 
  Profits are set to decline   and the group is vulnerable to
operational gearing in parts of its operations and high margins
in others  We believe that the shares do not fully reflect these
risks after recent strength   Credit Suisse analysts said 
 At 1415 GMT  Kingfisher stock was down 3 7 percent at 137 1
pence  valuing the firm at 3 3 billion pounds   4 8 billion  
 
 FIXING CHINA
 Kingfisher runs over 800 stores in eight countries and has
been hit hard by a downturn in most of its major markets 
 UK retail sales plunged 1 9 percent month on month in
February  official figures showed  while data from France showed
consumers mired in gloom 
 Kingfisher said it made profit before tax and one off items
of 368 million pounds in the year ended January  close to
analysts  average forecast of 364 million in a company poll 
 Sales from continuing operations rose 10 8 percent to 10 03
billion pounds  but were down 4 1 percent on a same store basis 
 B Q China made a loss of 52 million pounds  battered by a
property slump  and Kingfisher said it would respond by shutting
22 and downsizing 17 of its 63 stores there 
 It will revamp the rest as part of a plan that will cost
about 30 million pounds in cash  but which should be offset by
selling the two freehold stores among the 22 being shut 
 There will also be a non cash one off impairment charge of
160 million pounds  124 million of which relates to writing off
goodwill at the Chinese business 
 Cheshire said he had looked into exiting China  but said the
market still offered great long term growth potential if the
group corrected mistakes  such as over rapid expansion 
over reliance on suppliers and too many products 
 He was comfortable with analysts forecasts for the unit to
cut losses to 30 40 million pounds in 2009 10 and said he was
aiming for it to return to profit by the end of 2010 
 He did not expect job losses from the closures because the
stores employ many staff from suppliers  which are expected to
be redeployed  Kingfisher will actually hire a net 600 staff as
it takes a stronger control of remaining stores  he said 
 Cheshire said he was in contact with major international
retailers including Wal Mart  Carrefour  Tesco  Best Buy and
Decathlon over renting out space in the stores to be downsized 
  There s quite a lot of interest in the big box  store
format in China    he told a news conference  noting Germany s
Metro announced plans earlier this week to expand its MediaMarkt
electrical goods business into China 
 Cheshire said he was comfortable with analysts  consensus
forecast for adjusted profit in 2009 10 of 323 million pounds 
but the firm was focusing on trying to limit any profit fall 
 Kingfisher said it would cut capital spending to 300 million
pounds in 2009 10 from 390 million in 2008 9  It will also aim
to reduce working capital by a further 50 million pounds and
reduce costs in the UK by 1 percent year on year

 By Nicole Maestri
 NEW YORK  April 14  Reuters    U S  income tax refunds are
arriving in the mail  but this year many cautious consumers are
using the extra cash to pay down debt instead of splurging on a
flat screen television 
 It is just one way consumers have adjusted their spending
in the face of a prolonged recession and a possible reason
behind the government s disappointing March retail sales report
on Tuesday  said Britt Beemer  founder of America s Research
Group  which polls consumers on spending behavior 
 Consumers  have taken it on the chin   he said   They are
in a slash and burn mentality  They re trying to do everything
they can do to get their bills paid off  
 That behavior was a surprise to economists  who expected
March retail sales to rise 0 3 percent  after advancing in both
January and February  Instead  the Commerce Department said on
Tuesday that total retail sales dropped 1 1 percent in March 
 ID nN14419657 
 The S P Retail Index  fell 2 3 percent in late
afternoon trading  while Wal Mart Stores Inc  fell about
1 percent  Best Buy Co Inc  declined 6 5 percent and
Macy s Inc  fell 6 4 percent  The government report dimmed
hopes that the recession was close to hitting bottom  and
showed consumers are unswayed from their new frugal mind set 
 Analysts cautioned that March sales results should be
looked at in combination with April to account for the shift in
the Easter holiday to April this year from March last year 
  Still  pending April s release  March s estimates throw
cold water on the notion that consumer spending has hit
bottom   wrote Patrick Newport  U S  economist for IHS Global
Insight  in a note 
 SIGNS OF A RECOVERY OR STABILIZATION 
 Marshal Cohen  chief industry analyst at The NPD Group 
said he was encouraged that the sales figures for March were
not worse  given the high level of unemployment 
  When I look at the numbers  I sit there and see the
beginning signs of what I call stabilization  I m not calling
it recovery   he said 
 Richard Hastings  consumer strategist with Global Hunter
Securities  said there are signs of spending stabilizing and
consumers are  selectively  purchasing seasonal merchandise 
like lawn mowers  An uptick in sales of existing homes is
spurring demand for building materials and garden equipment  he
said 
 Beemer expects to see consumers head to stores around
holidays  such as Memorial Day or Independence Day  when they
believe retailers will offer the best deals 
 While consumers may be spending selectively  sales of
big ticket items took a nose dive in March  The Commerce
Department said sales of electronic goods and appliances
tumbled 5 9 percent  versus a 0 7 percent gain in February 
  Income tax refund checks historically drive 40 percent of
big ticket purchases of  500 or more in the months of March 
April and May   Beemer said 
 But this year  consumers expecting a tax refund said they
would put 85 percent    up from 70 percent last year    toward
paying bills and paying down debt  Beemer said 
 While Jennifer Lee  an economist with BMO Capital Markets 
said tax refunds offered consumers some comfort   massive job
losses remained prominent in consumers  minds  steering incomes
towards savings  
 The U S  economy lost 663 000 jobs last month  driving the
unemployment rate to a 25 year high of 8 5 percent  Economists
polled by Reuters expect the unemployment rate to rise to 9 8
percent a year from now 
 With such bleak figures  most consumers are not eager to
open their wallets  Bob Goldin  executive vice president at
food industry consulting firm Technomic Inc  said that he was
not seeing evidence that consumers are starting to indulge by
returning to restaurants or higher priced foods 
  I can t say that we have any hard evidence that things
have gotten better recently   Goldin said   It s slow out
there

 May 7  Reuters    Retailers are experiencing the worst
economic downturn in living memory  according to a straw poll of
delegates at the World Retail Congress in Barcelona  But some of
them are seeing signs that recovery is on the way 
 Following are some of the standout quotes from the three day
event  which ends on Friday 
 
 ECONOMIC RECOVERY
  I don t think it s going to get worse  but this is going to
be a lengthy process      I think we ll start to see
improvements towards the back end of this year     Best Buy
International Chief Executive Bob Willett
  There are some green shoots     My forecast is that by the
end of this year or at least early next year we ll see the U S 
economy start to grow again     Deloitte Director of Global
Research Ira Kalish
  Our view increasingly is that in certain discretionary
categories the total market has shifted down    depending on the
category  by between 15 and 25 percent     It may be many  many
years before we regain the spending levels we enjoyed just last
year      Borders Chief Executive Ron Marshall 
  I think there s a real risk that inflation will recover
over the next year  two years  and governments then have to take
action to look after that and then we get a second leg of the
recession later on     Mothercare Chairman Ian Peacock 
 
 EBAY ON SKYPE
 Asked on the sidelines of the conference about a potential
 2 billion valuation for Skype  eBay Chief Executive John
Donahoe said  I think that s low  
 
 E COMMERCE
  Consumers will actually press the buy button online 15 to
20 percent of the time     eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe 
predicting the rise of e commerce in a few years from its
current level of about 5 percent 
  I could see it  online sales at Mothercare  being 30  40 
maybe 50 percent in the next five to six years     Mothercare
Chief Executive Ben Gordon said in a video presentation at the
conference  Mothercare now sells 18 percent of sales online 
 
 PROTECTIONISM
  If you look at the pronouncements from the leaders during
the G20 meetings  everyone had on their agenda that they would
not put up trade protectionist barriers 
  But rhetoric is rhetoric  I am not so sure that trade
protectionism would not be a major issue coming forward
especially when you see that even in President Obama s rescue
package this  Buy American  concept     William Fung  managing
director of export sourcing and distribution group Li   Fung 
 
 DESTOCKING
  About 10 to 15 percent of the world s container ships have
actually been lying idle now for two or three months  Not only
that  but it s against the background of another 10 to 20
percent capacity in container ships coming on 
  The only silver lining that I see     is the fact that you
 retailers  are now operating on probably unprecedented low
levels of inventory and if there should be a turnaround   then
perhaps our turnaround on trade will be even sharper      Li  
Fung Managing Director William Fung      However  he added that
most suppliers were expecting a 5 to 15 percent drop in business
this year 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
  I think we need the green shoots to be really green and
there is a real opportunity to make green shoots sustainable
shoots in the year ahead     Tesco Director of Corporate and
Legal Affairs Lucy Neville Rolfe
 
 PRICES
  We re expecting between 5 and 10 percent price deflation
 from suppliers in Asia      Li   Fung Managing Director William
Fung
 
 UK ELECTRICALS SECTOR
  The UK s the real problem  There s a market where there s
overcapacity  There s a lack of differentiation between formats
    You could cover the whole of the UK with 400 stores     Kesa
Electricals Finance Director Simon Herrick
 
 SPANISH RETAIL
  I think everyone s losing in Spain  If it was just us I d
be worried  Unemployment is at 4 million  They say it s going to
go to 20 percent  This is not good news     Mango Executive Vice
President Isak Halfon
 
 SOUTH AFRICA RETAIL
  We ve now got through our elections  and I ve noticed the
rand has strengthened and there seems a little more confidence
about everything    Managing Director of Retail Andrew Jennings
of South Africa s Woolworth
 
 CONSUMER SPENDING IN FRANCE
  The difference between France and the UK is that the French
are savers  Sentiment may be up  or may be down  but volatility
will be lower     Kesa Finance Director Simon Herrick

167420,388936,BBY,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 Best Buy sees no quick recovery in retail,news,"  Consumer environment not worsening  but no quick recovery
   Sees improvement towards the end of this year
   Not interested in Kingfisher store space in China
   Aiming for own label sales to be 15 20 pct of total sales
 
  Adds quotes  background 
 By Mark Potter
 BARCELONA  May 6  Reuters    The consumer environment is not
getting any worse  but there is unlikely to be a rapid recovery
from the current downturn  Bob Willett  head of U S  retailer
Best Buy s international business  told Reuters 
  I don t think it s going to get worse  but this is going to
be a lengthy process  We re not going to come out of this in a
hurry   he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World
Retail Congress on Wednesday 
  I m not sure we ve seen all the fallout from the credit
card side of life  where banks are cutting back on giving people
credit   Willett said  adding that much of the government aid to
help banks had gone on repairing their balance sheets rather
than boosting credit  
  I think we ll start to see improvements towards the back
end of this year  
 Willett was relaxed about German retailer Metro AG s plans
to expand its MediaMarkt business  Europe s biggest electricals
retailer  into China 
  We re quite happy about what we do and we re quite happy
about facing them  or anyone else for that matter   he said 
 Willett said he planned to open between seven and 12 Best
Buy branded stores in China this year after opening four in
fairly quick succession to take the current total to five 
  I want to see how these other four pan out before we push
ahead with the others  but we will push ahead   he said 
 Willett said Best Buy was not interested in renting space in
China from British home improvements retailer Kingfisher  which
said in March it was in talks with a number of retailers about
sharing some of its stores there 
 Sales of Best Buy s own label products  like Insignia and
Rocket Fish  had been growing  really well  over the past 18
months  Willett said 
 Over the next few years  the firm hoped to increase
own label sales to between 15 percent and 20 percent of total
sales  up from about 5 6 percent currently  he said

167421,388937,BBY,Retailers seek to rein in recovery optimism,news,"By Mark Potter and Sarah Morris
 BARCELONA  May 8  Reuters    Retailers sought to dampen
hopes of a quick recovery from recession at an industry summit
this week  warning a legacy of over expansion  changing consumer
habits and online competition could curb growth for years 
 The good news was that the worst of a brutal downturn in
consumer spending appears to be over and companies able to
differentiate themselves from competitors and offer value for
money    not just the lowest prices    are still thriving 
  One fact remains the same  Strong brands that resonate with
the consumer can still grow regardless of today s economic
climate   Gilbert Harrison  chairman of retail focused
investment bank Financo  told the World Retail Congress  
 He pointed to the success of Apple Inc    voted the
conference s retailer of the year    with its iPhone 
 A straw poll of some of the 800 plus delegates at the start
of the three day gathering found a majority thought the economic
downturn was the worst in living memory 
 However  big cuts in interest rates and multi billion dollar
stimulus packages from governments around the world have lifted
consumer confidence from its lows and retail stocks have rallied
strongly in anticipation of a recovery 
  There is now a pervasive  persistent and pronounced
improvement in the leading economic indicators in the U S  and
also in China  so I m reasonably confident that the U S  economy
will bottom out in the next few months and the Chinese economy
likewise   said Ajay Kapur  chief global and Asia strategist at
Mirae Asset  the world s top equity investor in emerging
markets 
 Many retailers were notably more cautious  though 
particularly those selling discretionary items 
  I don t think it s going to get worse  but this is going to
be a lengthy process   Bob Willet  the head of U S  electricals
retailer Best Buy s international arm  told Reuters  saying
battered banks were still reluctant to lend to consumers  
 Baby goods retailer Mothercare also warned that any
short term recovery might be snuffed out as governments seek to
restore their finances and if inflationary pressures re emerge 
  There s a real risk that inflation will recover over the
next year  two years  and governments then have to take action
to look after that and then we get a second leg of the recession
later on   said Mothercare Chairman Ian Peacock 
 Vittorio Radice  head of Italian department store chain La
Rinascente was among the most pessimistic 
  In my opinion  the rate of growth  the rate of opportunity
 for retailers   putting us back to where we were in 2007  won t
happen up until 2012   he told Reuters 
 
 OVERSUPPLY AND ONLINE
 Executives also warned that the industry which emerges from
the recession will be very different from the one which entered
it 
 One problem is that a shift towards more cautious spending
in the United States and parts of Europe could prove lasting as
it will take time to pay down personal debts  
  Some of the fundamental core beliefs people had about their
financial security have been shaken   said Ron Marshall  head of
U S  bookseller Borders 
  It may be many  many years before we regain the spending
levels we enjoyed just last year  
 Phil Wrigley  chairman of fashion chain New Look  warned
that retailers would also suffer the hangover from a binge in
property development during the boom years  
 While retail sales in the United Kingdom rose around 3 5
percent over the past ten years  selling space increased by 9
percent  he said  adding the pattern was similar elsewhere  
  There s good news for the consumer because they re truly in
charge more than they ve ever been   Wrigley said   They ve got
more choice than they ve ever had before and that s put
significant pressure  on retailers   
 This oversupply is being compounded by rapid growth in
online retailing 
 But the Internet is also an opportunity for those able to
tap into its potential  said John Donahoe  chief executive of
Internet market place eBay  He believes that e commerce will
grow to 15 20 percent of the total retail market over the coming
years  from around 5 percent now  
 Combining successful Internet products with a must have
gadget creates a potent force  Donahoe said  heralding the
addition of eBay s Internet phone call arm Skype to Apple s
iPhone  
  Within 24 hours it was the largest application on the
iPhone in 40 countries   he said   Three weeks later  it s
downloaded on 10 percent of the iPhones

 LONDON  Nov 27  Reuters    DSG International  Europe s
second largest electrical goods retailer swung to a first half
loss and suspended its dividend as it grapples with the
deepening consumer downturn 
  Given the current economic conditions  the outlook is
uncertain for peak trading and 2009  The group has set the
business conservatively to preserve cash and earnings   it said 
 DSG  whose store chains include Currys and PC World in
Britain  Elkjop in the Nordic region and UniEuro in Italy 
posted an underlying loss before tax of 29 8 million pounds for
the 24 weeks to Oct  18 
 This compares to analysts  forecasts of a loss of 25 million
pounds to 35 million pounds and a year earlier profit before tax
of 52 4 million pounds 
 Group sales increased 3 percent to 3 47 billion pounds 
 Sales at stores open at least a year fell 7 percent in the
first half  while gross profit margins were down 70 basis

 DSG said trading conditions got worse as the second half
progressed and cut its investment plans with capital expenditure
for the current year cut by 30 million pounds to 160 million
pounds 
  To preserve liquidity and to ensure the delivery of the
renewal and transformation plan a dividend will not be paid in
the current financial year   it said 
 DSG ended the first half with net debt of 149 5 million
pounds 
  The group is compliant with the financial covenants of its

 Chief Executive John Browett said the group was prioritising
cash generation as well as tightly managing stock  margins and

 LONDON  Nov 27  Reuters    Downbeat results and gloomy
outlooks at leading British retailers DSG and Kingfisher
underlined the severity of the economic slowdown on Thursday  as
Woolworths collapsed into administration 
 Britain s retailers are struggling with intense competition
and a downturn in consumer spending  amid sliding house prices 
rising unemployment and fears the country has already entered
recession 
 DSG International Plc  Europe s second largest electrical
goods retailer and owner of the Currys and PC World chains in
Britain  swung to its first first half loss for at least 25
years and axed its dividend  sending its shares down 5 4 percent
by 1503 GMT 
  Given the current economic conditions  the outlook is
uncertain for peak trading and 2009  The group has set the
business conservatively to preserve cash and earnings   it said 
 Kingfisher  Europe s top home improvement retailer which
runs market leaders B Q in Britain and Castorama in France  beat
forecasts with an 8 3 percent rise in third quarter profit but
said trading was set to get tougher 
 Its shares were down 2 3 percent 
 Confirmation of Woolworths  decision to put its stores and
its Entertainment UK units into administration came a day after
MFI  a privately owned furniture and fitted kitchens specialist 
collapsed into administration  The demise of both groups would
threaten 31 000 jobs 
 Figures in October from the Confederation of British
Industry showed sales volumes falling for a seventh straight
month  while comments from John Lewis    closely watched as an
indicator of retail trends    indicated department store sales
would likely show a year on year drop for an 11th week in a row 

 Mark Price  managing director of John Lewis s supermarket
arm Waitrose  also warned the retail environment was likely to
get tougher 
 DSG  which also runs Elkjop stores in the Nordic region and
UniEuro outlets in Italy  fell to an underlying pretax loss of
29 8 million pounds   46 million  in the 24 weeks to Oct  18
from a profit of 52 4 million a year ago 
 
 SHARP FALL
 Shares in DSG  which operates 1 200 shops and online stores
in 28 countries  have slumped 88 percent over the past year  hit
by the sharp fall in demand for big ticket items  worries over
U S  rival Best Buy s entry into Europe next year and concerns
over the withdrawal of credit insurance for suppliers 
 The company s market value has dropped to around 226 million
pounds    less than 11 days  sales 
 Chief Executive John Browett was adamant DSG would not
mirror the fate of Woolworths  whose board placed its 815 store
retail business and entertainment wholesale distribution
business into administration  a form of creditor protection 
  I don t think it could be another Woolies situation  I
think it s a completely different situation     the parallels
just don t work   he told reporters 
 Analysts at Citi  DSG s joint house broker  repeated their
 sell  recommendation  citing significantly deteriorating
newsflow across the sector and recent John Lewis data 
 Kingfisher  which employs over 70 000 people in more than
800 stores in eight countries  said sales at stores open at
least a year fell 5 1 percent in the 13 weeks to Nov  1  with
strong results in Poland and France offset by weaker trading in
the UK and a plunge in sales in China 
 The stock was down 5 3 pence at 114 1p 
  There are clearly more challenging times ahead and we are
concentrating on trading effectively in difficult markets by
managing our working capital  cash and costs tightly   Chief
Executive Ian Cheshire said 
 Kingfisher s shares have more than halved in value over the
past 18 months but have steadied since July on hopes that
Cheshire s recovery plan    a mix of cost savings and expansion
in stronger markets like France and Poland    might bear fruit 
 Analysts at Investec remain sellers   UK like for like sales
are heading towards double digit declines and the margin outlook
for quarter four in both UK and France is much tougher   they
said in a note  adding  China looks horrible  
 Woolworths  administrator Deloitte said its retail and
entertainment distribution businesses would continue to trade
and employees would be paid  It appointed restructuring
specialist Hilco to assist in the management of the stores 
 Deloitte said it had received expressions of interest from a
number of parties for both the retail and wholesale businesses 
 In another sign of the uncertain retail outlook  billionaire
Philip Green said he had decided against bidding for men s
fashion retailer Moss Bros  whose shares slumped 41 percent

167444,388960,BBY,UPDATE 5 U S  shoppers seek deals  buy less on Black Friday,news," Adds quotes  mall details 
 By Alexandria Sage and Aarthi Sivaraman
 SAN FRANCISCO NEW YORK  Nov 28  Reuters    Shoppers lured
by money saving deals filled U S stores on Friday  but the
annual kick off to holiday shopping appeared weaker this year
as worries about a deep recession kept purchases down 
 The day after the U S  Thanksgiving Day marks the
traditional start of the holiday shopping season  when
retailers can make up to 40 percent of their annual sales 
Crowds gathered outside stores for predawn deals 
 The frenzied bargain hunting took a somber turn at one Long
Island  New York store  where an employee at Wal Mart in Valley
Stream died after a throng of shoppers broke down the doors to
enter the store at 5 a m  EST  1000 GMT   police said  Four
others were hurt in what Wal Mart called a  tragic  incident 
 To generate excitement during what some experts predict may
be the bleakest holiday shopping season in nearly two decades 
retailers from Wal Mart Stores Inc  to Macy s Inc  
Kohl s Corp  and Best Buy Co Inc  opened their
doors early on  Black Friday  
 This holiday weekend will test the strength of consumer
sentiment  a main driver of the U S  economy  as the country
faces its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression 
 Marjorie Daube  59  of Manhattan scaled back her shopping
and was only buying sale items  aware that her husband s bonus
at a financial firm would decline this year 
  Shopping was never fun at all  and it s less fun now  
Daube said 
 Natalie Diaz  32  planned to cut by half the  2 000 she
shelled out last year for Christmas gifts  but said she would
not scrimp on presents for her twins 
  Santa does not have a recession   she said  shopping at a
J C  Penney Co Inc  store in Jersey City  New Jersey 
 Michele Greaves  browsing in a Brooklyn mall  said she
would buy her children only one present each this year 
  I m penny pinching  and I ask myself   Do you really need
that   My kids are small  I have to save   Greaves said 
 MORE TRAFFIC  FEWER BAGS
 Early store traffic was lighter this year  but picked up by
midday  said Marshal Cohen  chief retail analyst at NPD Group 
  The traffic is up compared to last year  but the bag count
is down   he said   There may be more casual shoppers  but
they re not buying as much as last year  
 Britt Beemer of America s Research Group said he saw
shoppers carrying 25 to 40 percent fewer bags this year 
  If the item was there  they bought it  If it wasn t there 
they left   said Beemer  calling this year s customer a
 hit and run shopper  
 A weak view of holiday sales was evident on Wall Street on
Friday  The Standard   Poor s Retail Index  slipped 1 6
percent on Friday and is down 36 percent so far this year 
versus a 39 percent drop for the S P 500 index  
 Consumer electronics  toys and clothing were the goods in
highest demand  from flat screen televisions to cashmere
sweaters  according to the National Retail Federation 
 At one Best Buy in New Jersey it took up to 1 1 2 hours for
a crowd of 700 to 1 000 people to enter the store at 5 a m   a
manager said 
 Cars were parked on the lawn and sidewalk outside a Circuit
City  store in Burlington  Massachusetts  after the
bankrupt retailer announced six hour specials 
 Best Buy President Brian Dunn told Reuters he was pleased
with customer response to its offers 
  It s almost cathartic to see people out there buying again
and focusing not so much on the fear and the drudgery of the
tough news that we re all dealing with   Dunn said 
 Parking lots at Taubman Centers Inc  malls in New
Jersey  Virginia  Michigan and Connecticut were nearly 100
percent full by the afternoon  a spokeswoman said 
 Still  holiday traffic is not the best indicator of sales 
since shoppers may balk at buying once they arrive  or buy
sparingly  Deep price cuts mean stores may need to sell twice
the merchandise to preserve profits  said NPD s Cohen 
 One Macy s employee in San Francisco  Michael Vaughan  said
he booked  3 000 in sales in the first three hours the store
was open  but associates told him the norm for that period for
 Black Friday  was four times that amount 
 WAL MART PROSPERS
 Discounters like Wal Mart have prospered in recent months
as more consumers seek out low prices  But mid tier retailers
like department store operator Macy s and specialty chains such
as AnnTaylor Stores Corp  are fighting to retain
customers and eke out profits 
 Retail sales at U S  stores open at least a year could fall
2 4 percent in November  or 7 1 percent excluding Wal Mart 
compared with 4 percent growth last year  based on analysts 
forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters 
 Macy s Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said the company has
worked closely with its vendors to craft discounts without
cutting too deeply into its own margins 
  One of the great advantages of being the largest customer
to practically everyone you do business with is sharing in
margin with our vendors and suppliers   Lundgren told Reuters 
 Sales of clothing and big ticket luxury items have been hit
particularly hard as consumers cut back on everything but the
most basic items  Electronics sellers and toy stores hope their
goods will remain on the must have lists of gift givers 
 Online retailer Amazon com Inc  said Apple Inc s
 iPod personal music and video player was the No 
1 selling item on its website in the first 11 hours on Friday 
 Some shoppers felt deflated by  Black Friday s  sales 
  It was alright   said Christal Horton  at a Brooklyn
Target Corp  store   I thought it would be cheaper  
 Shoppers who held back on Friday may be expecting deeper
discounts later in December

167451,388967,BBY,PREVIEW Tesco  DSG eyed as two tier UK Christmas unfolds,news,"  Tesco seen reporting modest rise in underlying Xmas sales
   DSG  Home Retail expected to post big falls

 By Mark Potter and James Davey
 LONDON  Jan 9  Reuters    A raft of Christmas sales updates
from UK retailers next week is likely to underscore the trends
seen so far  with food and discount chains coping in the
economic downturn  but sellers of discretionary items suffering 
 Tesco  Britain s biggest retailer  is expected to report a
modest rise in underlying sales on Tuesday  held back compared
to some of its supermarket rivals by a greater exposure to
non food lines like clothing and electricals 
 In contrast DSG International  Britain s biggest electrical
goods retailer  and top household goods group Home Retail are
forecast to deliver big falls in underlying sales on Thursday 
 Trading updates published so far suggest there was no
collapse in spending over Christmas  as some had feared  
 This has sparked a rally of about 6 8 percent in the FTSE
All Share Retail Index since the start of the  year  and to some
speculation the worst might be over for retail stocks  with
falling interest rates  food and fuel prices all set to help the
beleaguered consumer in the coming months  
 But with store groups warning trade will stay tough while
unemployment is rising  house prices are falling and the economy
is sinking deeper into recession  many analysts remain cautious 
  Consumers are being buffeted by very serious headwinds that
will substantially limit their spending over the coming months  
said IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer 
 This will force retailers to keep prices low and could drive
more out of business  following the collapse of toys to DVDs
chain Woolworths and furniture group MFI last year  he said 
 
 VALUE RETAILERS SHINE
 Tesco  the world s third biggest retailer  will report a
rise in sales from UK stores open at least a year  excluding
fuel  of between 1 7 percent and 3 percent for the six weeks to
Jan 3  according to a Reuters poll of six analysts 
 That would be below the 4 5 percent reported by smaller
rival J  Sainsbury for the 13 weeks to Jan  3  in part because
of Tesco s greater presence in the non food market 
 Tesco has also seen a strong uptake for its new range of
discount brands which  because they are cheaper products  has
depressed sales values  It believes the higher sales volumes the
new range is generating will stand it in good stead if consumers
rein in spending further in the coming year  
 Discount clothing retailer Primark is also likely to sound
upbeat when its parent Associated British Foods releases a
first quarter trading update on Thursday  
 Sellers of expensive or discretionary items  however  are
likely to be finding life much tougher 
 
 ELECTRICALS  HOUSEHOLD GOODS SUFFER
 DSG  Europe s second biggest electrical goods group  is
expected to report a drop in like for like sales of between 7
and 12 percent for the 12 weeks to Jan  10  according to a
company poll of analysts 
 Shares in the owner of PC World and Currys chains in
Britain  UniEuro in Italy and Elkjop in Nordic countries  have
slumped 73 percent over the past year amid concerns it might
breach the rules covering its debt arrangements and worries over
U S  rival Best Buy s entry into Europe next year 
 Carphone Warehouse  Europe s biggest mobile phone retailer 
is also likely to sound downbeat at a third quarter trading
update on Thursday  though JP Morgan analysts think the bad news
is factored in after a profit warning last year 
 News from Home Retail  the owner of Argos stores and the
Homebase do it yourself chain  is likely to be grim as well  
 Argos is set to report a drop in underlying sales of 7
percent to 9 percent for the 18 weeks to Jan  3  with Homebase
down by 8 5 percent to 12 percent  according to a Reuters poll
of four analysts 
 As well as weak consumer demand  non food retailers have had
to contend with clearance sales at casualties of the downturn 
such as Woolworths and rival entertainments chain Zavvi  
 This could impact computer games retailer Game Group and
music and books group HMV  which have sales updates on Tuesday
and Thursday respectively  However  analysts think both will be
benefit in the long term from reduced competition 
 Analysts also expect a big fall in sales at sporting goods
chain JJB Sports on Thursday and are keen to hear how talks on
long term funding for the company are progressing

   Shares down 7 5 percent at 1120 GMT

  Adds CEO  FD comments  updates shares 
 By James Davey
 LONDON  Jan 15  Reuters    DSG International Plc  Europe s
second biggest electricals retailer on Thursday reported a
further deterioration in sales and profit margins for the key
Christmas period and said it was planning further cost cuts 
  We expect 2009 to be challenging across most of our
markets   said Chief Executive John Browett  adding that his
renewal and transformation plan for the group was  on track  
 He told reporters DSG expected  high single digit  negative
like for like sales throughout 2009 but was budgeting the
business to survive much worse 
  What we re not expecting to see is some kind of disastrous
slump of biblical proportions  we re expecting to see a normal
recession   he said 
  We ve very carefully tracked this recession compared to
previous ones and it s following the normal cycle  It doesn t
look like it s out of the ordinary 
 In response to the trading environment DSG has identified a
further 20 million pounds   29 23 million  of cost savings 
bringing total savings for the year to the end of April 2009 to
95 million pounds 
 Browett said the savings would be across  every single
aspect  of the business  He said jobs would go through  natural
churn  rather than a big redundancy programme 
 Prior to Thursday s update shares in DSG had slumped 74
percent over the past year  hit by the consumer downturn 
worries over U S  rival Best Buy s entry into Europe and
concerns over the withdrawal of credit insurance for suppliers 
 At 1120 GMT the stock was down 1 5 pence  or 7 5 percent  at
18 75 pence  valuing the business at 327 million pounds   485 3
million     just two weeks  sales 
 The firm  whose store chains include Currys and PC World in
Britain  Elkjop in the Nordic region and UniEuro in Italy  said
its sales at stores open at least one year fell 10 percent over
the 12 weeks to Jan  10 
 This compares to analysts  forecasts of a drop in
like for like sales of between 7 and 12 percent  and a fall of 7
percent in the first half to Oct  18 
 Many UK retailers are struggling as consumers rein in
spending amid sliding house prices  soaring unemployment and
fears of a deep recession  Retailers of big ticket discretionary
items have been particularly badly hit 
 On Thursday Argos  the high street catalogue retailer 
reported a 7 5 percent fall in like for like sales for the 18
weeks to Jan  3 
 
 MARGINS DOWN
 Gross profit margins were down 0 8 percent year on year 
having been down 0 7 percent in the first half  reflecting the
increased proportion of revenue in the sale period as customers
waited to buy discretionary products  particularly televisions
and laptops  at cut down prices 
 Browett s plan is focused on cash  cutting costs  managing
margins and reducing stock  Stock levels were 16 percent lower
than last year 
 He is also working to improve customer service and is
developing new format stores  DSG said these performed well with
sales 15 percent to 25 percent ahead of the rest of the chain 
 In November  DSG  which operates 1 200 shops and online
stores in 28 countries  swung to a first half loss and suspended
its dividend  It ended its first half with a net debt of 149 5
million pounds 
 The company said on Thursday it was operating within its 400
million pound committed credit facility  which was currently
undrawn and available  although it anticipated some drawdown
would occur in its final quarter 
  I think at year end we will be between 150 and 200 million
pounds drawn down   said Finance Director Nicholas Cadbury 
 Analysts at Citi said in a research note they expected
consensus pretax profit forecasts for the current year to fall
about 20 percent to about 50 million pounds  In the previous
year DSG made 205 million pounds 
  As one of the most operationally leveraged and financially
leveraged businesses in our general retail coverage universe 
DSG is very materially impacted by the current cyclical
slowdown recession   they said 
 Some analysts reckoned DSG would be lucky to break even in
the year to end April 2010

   Kesa Christmas lfl sales seen down 6 5 8 8 percent
 By James Davey and Mark Potter
 LONDON  Jan 16  Reuters    A trading update from Wm Morrison
next week is likely to see the British supermarket emerge as one
of the winners of the Christmas period  while one from Kesa
Electricals is expected to place it firmly in the losers  camp 
 On Thursday  Morrison  Britain s fourth biggest supermarket
group  is forecast to emerge at the top end of the grocers 
Christmas performance table  reinforcing a trend that has seen
cash strapped Britons embrace chains with reputations for low
prices over upmarket rivals 
 In contrast Kesa  Europe s third largest electrical goods
retailer which trades as Comet in the UK and Darty in France  is
forecast to report a big fall in underlying sales on Tuesday 
highlighting how purveyors of big ticket items are continuing to
struggle 
 The blizzard of trading statements so far this month has
shown there was no collapse in spending over Christmas  as some
had predicted  The trend has been for discount and food
retailers to outperform  while discretionary spending is
suffering 
 Morrison will report a rise in sales from UK stores open at
least a year  excluding fuel  of between 7 and 8 5 percent for
the six weeks to Jan  4  with an average of 7 6 percent 
according to a Reuters poll of seven analysts 
 In December the group reported growth of 8 1 percent for its
third quarter to end Oct 
  It would be reasonable to expect some deceleration given
tough comparatives  although the business has remained extremely
promotional   said analysts at UBS in a research note 
 So far J Sainsbury Plc  Britain s third biggest grocer  has
posted underlying sales up 4 5 percent for the 13 weeks to Jan 
3  outshining market leader Tesco Plc s s 2 5 percent rise for
the seven weeks to Jan  10 
 The UK s number two grocer Asda  owned by U S  group
Wal Mart  does not publish numbers until Feb  17  But it has
said it enjoyed one of its strongest Christmas sales seasons and
implied its fourth quarter to Dec  31 outcome would surpass the
6 9 percent growth reported for its third quarter     Data from
market researcher TNS Worldpanel on Tuesday showed Morrison was
the fastest growing UK food retailer in the run up to Christmas 
 It said Morrison s sales rose 9 7 percent in the 12 weeks to
Dec  28 against the comparable period last year  outperforming a
grocery market growing 6 percent 
 Morrison shares have outperformed the DJ Stoxx European
Retail Index by about 8 percent over the last year 
 KESA GLOOM
 Kesa is expected to report a drop in like for like sales of
between 6 5 and 8 8 percent for the 10 weeks to Jan  3 
according to a Reuters poll of five analysts 
 Its statement is expected to echo the gloomy tone of bigger
rival DSG International  which trades as Currys and PC World in
Britain  UniEuro in Italy and Elkjop in Nordic countries 
 It posted a 10 percent fall in like for like sales for the
12 weeks to Jan  10 on Thursday 
 Shares in Kesa have halved over the past year as sliding
house prices and soaring unemployment have put people off buying
fridges and washing machines  Worries over rival Best Buy s
entry into Europe has also dented sentiment

167458,388974,BBY,Italian Election And Jay Powell Testimony ,opinion,"We will return with a video from Kelly and Jasper next week  In today s written report  we discuss stocks in a holding pattern  new Fed Chair Jay Powell s first testimony to Congress and the Italian election  We also run through the top earnings and economic data on tap this week 
Stocks in a volatile range
The last three weeks in the stock market have been a change up from the slow burn uptrend of 2017  Stocks had one week of selling off  the next week was the bounce back then last week they were stuck in a volatile trading range  These three stages are somewhat predictable  Where we head next is less obvious  A break higher or lower both seem equally feasible outcomes 
Powell testimony  to calm the storm 
For his first testimony to Congress which comes two weeks after the biggest one day points decline in US stock market history we think Jay Powell plays his cards pretty close to his chest  We assume Powell will tread a fine line between the slightly hawkish FOMC minutes released last week and other Fed speakers like Bullard and Kaplan who have talked cautiously about the need for a fourth rate hike this year 
The reason   justification for the market sell off was fear of rising inflation resulting in a faster pace of rate hikes from central banks  In meetings and speeches since market corrected  central bankers have been slow to acknowledge that inflation is set to raise faster than earlier estimates  Nonetheless  bond yields have continued to push higher with 10 Year bond yields at a 4 year high  Higher yields make stocks compete for investor cash  If yields do continue to rise  it makes sense that eventually yields hit a level that causes another jerk lower for stocks  The dollar s downtrend has been resilient while global yields have been rising but any hawkish surprise from Powell could tip the balance back in favor of the buck 
The Italian election
The Italian election takes place Sunday March 4  There is a risk that markets are under pricing the chance of another messy European election result  particularly with the populist Five Start movement set to receive the most votes  The Italy Germany yield spread has been tightening  if investors were pricing in political risk to Italy it would be going the other way

167459,388975,BBY,Retailers must dare to be different  say UK CEOs,news,"  UK trading likely to get tougher as import costs rise
   Value for money is more important than lowest price
   Business failures easing the pain for survivors
 
 By Mark Potter
 LONDON  March 19  Reuters    Retailers must offer value for
money  though not necessarily the lowest prices  and dare to be
different if they are to survive a deepening economic recession
in Britain  according to top industry executives 
 Trading is likely to get tougher in coming months as a
weaker pound and rising import costs mean stores will have to
raise prices in the teeth of flagging demand  they warned at a
Retail Week conference in London on Wednesday and Thursday 
 However  rising business failures will ease competition for
survivors and plunging property prices will create an
opportunity for the few    mostly discounters  supermarkets and
major international players    with the money to expand 
  What we re seeing this time  I think as distinct from
previous recessions  is that capacity is coming out early   said
Justin King  chief executive of grocer J Sainsbury 
  For those of us that remain  the opportunity to soak up
that capacity     is much greater  
 Most retailers are struggling as shoppers curb spending amid
rising worries about their jobs  even as disposable incomes are
boosted by record low interest rates and falling fuel costs 
 Some  including longstanding chains like sweets to DVDs
group Woolworths and furniture store MFI  have collapsed  and
more could run into trouble as quarterly rent payments fall due
next Wednesday  law firm Wedlake Bell said this week 
  I think we ve still got more pain to come until we can talk
about recovery   said Alan White  chief executive of N  Brown  a
specialist in larger sized clothes for older women 
 Phil Wrigley  executive chairman of women s fashion chain
New Look  warned retailers faced a  quantum leap  to manage
rising import costs stemming from the slide in the pound 
  You have to take market share to survive   he said  
 
 VALUE 
 Low prices are the key to attracting shoppers  argued
Hussein Lalani  commercial director at discounter 99p Stores 
  Every penny counts   he said  adding that in one town a
shop selling items for 1 pound went out of business when one of
his own stores  which sell for a penny cheaper  opened nearby 
 Others  however  said value for money was more important 
  Consumers want special products at special prices  not
necessarily the lowest prices   said John Lovering  chairman of
department stores group Debenhams  which has seen strong sales
of its  Designers at Debenhams  range 
 Sainsbury s King said it was also important to capture the
mood of the times  adding that campaigns like  cook and save 
and  love your leftovers  had helped his group to prosper 
despite forecasts it would suffer from its mid market position 
 Angela Spindler  chief executive of The Original Factory
Shop discount chain  said retailers needed to learn lessons from
the collapse of Woolworths  which failed to differentiate itself
amid growing competition from supermarkets and the Internet 
 Finding a distinct voice was key to reviving Wm Morrison
Supermarkets  agreed its chief executive Marc Bolland 
 He rejected analysts calls to sell off Morrison s
manufacturing business and follow rivals  with a big push into
non food products because he wanted to keep the firm s claim to
offer the freshest food  thanks to sourcing products internally 
 Pain for some is creating opportunities for others 
 Bob Willett  chief executive of Best Buy s international
business  said the U S  electrical goods retailer had delayed
its UK launch until next Spring in part to benefit from
 enormous reductions  in property prices  
 Lalani of 99p Stores said he was also looking to benefit
from a  gap tooth high street  and said he could envisage a
chain of around 500 stores  compared with about 75 currently

167468,388984,BBY,5 Top Earnings Growth Stocks To Buy In February,opinion,Since we have entered the Q4 reporting cycle  looking for stocks with unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for astute investors  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t last over the long haul  Consider a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you have earnings This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock Earnings Estimates Shape Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost controls  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while taking investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm As the earnings season picks up pace  investors should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to invest in stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we have added the following parameters Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only Zacks   Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off   You can see  5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry  Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history    Change EPS F 0  F  1  greater than or equal to 5  Companies that witnessed year over year earnings growth rate of 5  or more in the last reported fiscal    Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks    Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week    Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks  The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7 818 stocks to only 31 Here are the top five stocks Best Buy Co    NYSE BBY   operates as a retailer of technology products  services  and solutions in the United States  Canada  and Mexico  The company s estimated growth rate for this year is

167469,388985,BBY,Market s Oversold Conditions Quickly End   More To Come ,opinion,"AT40   23 4  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   47 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   30 0  19 7  decrease  intraday high of 50 3 Short term Trading Call  neutral
CommentaryThe first oversold period in about two years ended after just one day  As a reminder  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   typically only spends 1 or 2 days below 20   So the market just cycled through a typical oversold period from an historical perspective  Adding to the sense of a bottoming process  AT40 traded as low as 12 0 before soaring to a 23 4  close 

AT40  T2108  acted like a plunger as it flushed out a large portion of lingering negative sentiment  This move marked a dramatic close to a 1 day oversold period 
As I noted in the last Above the 40 post  waiting to buy until the oversold period ended would face an immediate test of the S P 500 staring at resistance from its 50DMA  The index closed with a 1 7  gain after an initial drop further below its lower Bollinger Band  BB   The GOOD news is that tech stocks led the way such that both the NASDAQ  up 2 1   and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ   up 2 7   closed ABOVE their 50DMAs  The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  delivered a relatively convincing bounce of 200DMA support 

At its over stretched low  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   completed a reversal of the mid November breakout  Buyers produced a strong close but now overhead resistance looms from the 50DMA 


At its low  the NASDAQ returned to its price from the end of November  Its 2 1  gain delivered a close above 50DMA resistance 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  followed the NASDAQ s lead with a close above 50DMA resistance after a huge gap down at the open 


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  had a near picture perfect bounce off 200DMA support 
Despite the general good cheer on the day  I am sticking to the current short term trading strategy  I flipped the trading call to neutral in deference to 50DMA resistance for the S P 500  At the close  I bought a put option on Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  as another partial hedge on my recent longs 
During the day  I focused on trading the oversold conditions  As the VIX soared toward 50  AT40 sank toward 12  and the S P 500 stretched further below its lower BB  I felt compelled to buy call options on SPY  A double came quickly as the rubber band of the market snapped back  I also furiously sold my put options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   Over the past week  I accumulated three tranches  Amazingly  UVXY plunged fast enough to enable me to profit on all my positions  I closed the first two positions during the market s rapid bounce off the lows  The market s run up into the close of trading allowed me to take profits on my last tranche of UVXY put options  I effectively hit the reset button on my volatility bets  Given the blow up in the short volatility products  I will proceed ever more carefully 

The S P 500 moved quickly after the open  It formed a W bottom intraday to setup the bumrush higher into the close 


The volatility index  the VIX  soared as high as the 2010 and 2011 intraday highs before beginning the anticipated implosion  Still  the VIX bounced off a low of 22 4 to close at 30 0 


The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  met its match at 200DMA resistance 

The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  whipped around violently with a tremendous range 
After the early morning success  I rolled out my shopping list again  It was telling that the market filled NONE of my low ball offers  I only got fills where I decided to pay the current asking price  I focused particularly on home builders as I have a specific seasonal strategy in play that extends out over several more months  As a reminder  this sell off delivered the prices that I believed I would not see again for this seasonally strong period  I made first tranche buys in Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH  shares and call options  and I bought call options in Lennar  NYSE LEN   MTH gapped down below its 200DMA but surged above it for a 4 7  gain on the day  LEN bounced in picture perfect style off its 200DMA support 

Meritage Homes  MTH  survived a breakdown below its 200DMA support to finish with a 4 7  gain 


Lennar  LEN  tapped its 200DMA support and launched from there for a 4 8  gain 
I strongly suspect sellers are not done  Anyone who has soured on this suddenly agitated market and got caught flat footed by the recent sell off will likely sell into higher prices  That selling could then easily motivate copycat selling which produces at least one more trip to oversold territory  In other words  the recent lows could easily get retested before the bottoming process comes to an end  In the currency markets  traders seem to be bracing for more selling  the Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  completed an impressive bounce during U S  trading hours but at the time of typing this indicative currency is fading 

The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  soared during the day s bounce from oversold conditions but is significantly off the highs of that day 

Stay tuned and continue to brace for anything 
CHART REVIEWSBest Buy  NYSE BBY  BBY is one of the strongest retailers from a trading perspective  and it now has my eye again  The stock gapped down below its 50DMA   no doubt took out a lot of stops   and proceeded to rally above its 50DMA for a 3 4  gain  Much larger trading volume would have given me more confidence in this bounce 

Best Buy  BBY  completed a reversal of 2017 s sharp gains but may be ready for an extended bounce from 50DMA support 

Kodak  NYSE KODK  KODK successfully tested 50DMA support but still closed with a 6 5  loss  The stock is now below where I first speculated on it  and I am ready for a new round  Investors must be getting tired of waiting around for the Initial Coin Offering  ICO   The ICO was supposed to happen at the end of January  I got the following explanation on Monday from a KODK email distribution 

 The ICO is moving full speed ahead  We expect to close the pre sale rounds in short order and move to closing the ICO soon after that 
In light of the increased worldwide regulatory interest in ICOs  we are taking the necessary measures to ensure that the KodakCoin ICO complies with all applicable securities and other laws  As a result  the first step in the process is to ensure that all investors satisfy the investor qualification requirements of the applicable jurisdictions in which offers and sales will be made  This phase will last for a few weeks  after which we intend to sell KodakCoins to eligible investors 
We look forward to completing the ICO and moving forward to build an innovative solution to protect the work of photographers  


Kodak  KODK  failed to benefit from the day s rally but did manage to hold 50DMA support

167472,388988,BBY,GLOBAL MARKETS World stocks hit 2 wk low  sterling skids,news,"  MSCI world equity index down 1 2 percent at 212 52
   Sterling below  1 49 and at 12 year low on TWI
   Short dated government bonds rally  yields tumble
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  Nov 13  Reuters    World stocks fell to a two week
low on Thursday after Washington backed away from its plan to
buy toxic assets  while sterling hit fresh 12 year lows a day
after the Bank of England warned of a sharp economic slowdown 
 Oil hit a 22 month low below  55 a barrel before it regained
poise  Short term European government bond yields fell to a
three year low as data showing Germany had slipped into 
recession spurred appetite for safer government bonds 
 The Bush administration largely abandoned its plan to buy up
toxic mortgage assets and it will focus its  700 billion
financial bailout fund on making direct investments in financial
institutions and shoring up consumer credit markets 
 This  combined with a dismal forecast from Best Buy 
and a revenue warning from Intel   weighed on Asian and
European shares 
  This is a case study of a massive deflationary economic
situation that is building up  There is no doubt we are entering
into a recession and it could be pretty nasty and deep   said
Valerie Plagnol  chief strategist at CM CIC Securities in Paris 
The MSCI world equity index  fell 1 2
percent  approaching October s five year lows  while the
FTSEurofirst 300 index  fell 0 7 percent  U S  stock
futures pointed to a firmer open on Wall Street later 
 Sterling fell as low as  1 4807   its lowest in 6 1 2
years and 82 0   GBP  on a trade weighted basis  It also hit a
record low of 84 56 pence per euro   The dollar 
fell 0 6 percent against a basket of major currencies 
 The Bank of England said in a quarterly inflation report on
Wednesday that the economy was likely to contract further next
year and inflation could fall below 1 percent in two years 
 Investors expect the BoE to follow up November s shock 1 5
point interest rate cut next month with another half a point
reduction as it tries to drag Britain out of recession  The cost
of borrowing now stands at 3 percent 
 Emerging stocks  fell 2 5 percent  having earlier
hit a two week low  Russian stocks have lost more than  1
trillion in value since early May 
 After hitting a four year low in October  emerging stocks
outpaced developed counterparts in recovering  However  that
speedy rebound seems to be unwinding equally fast 
  We now expect the relative momentum to ease and that the
risk reward for holding emerging long and the world short be far
less attractive as market conditions once again are
deteriorating   SEB said in a note to clients 
 U S  crude oil  fell below  55 a barrel as worries
grew that a global recession would sap energy demand  before it
recovered towards  57 
 The December bund future  was steady on the day
while the two year euro zone government bond yield fell to a
three year low of 2 23 percent

 On top of this bold declaration  JPMorgan upgraded DKS to  overweight  from  neutral  and raised its price target to  32  which would represent a 20  upside from the stock s opening price on Wednesday  The firm also suggested that Dick s is akin to Best Buy   NYSE BBY    in that both brands should be stable enough to survive the retail downturn 
  We  appreciate the company s consistent focus on investing in its stores and the efforts in 2018 to put the customer at the center   wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note 
The firm pointed to management s plan to initiate an  athletic inventory clean up  in the first half of the upcoming calendar year  arguing an inventory reduction will alleviate promotional pressure and improve average ticket 
Interestingly  JPMorgan s optimistic outlook for the sport retailer s fiscal 2018 seems to be in contrast with the company s own tepid guidance  On Tuesday  Dick s reported a respectable third quarter fiscal 2017  but the stock tumbled on the back of a not so impressive initial view for fiscal 2018  also read    
While Dick s did report earnings and sales surprises  the company warned of a tough retail environment next year  Management said that it expects the retail environment to be extremely promotional throughout 2018 
On top of this  excess inventory in the supply chain  broadened distribution strategies from some vendors  and a lack of innovation and novelty could put pressure on margins  Nevertheless  management anticipates increasing investments in e commerce  the technology in its stores  and store payroll

The final Markit U S  Manufacturing PMI Index was revised to 52 8 for August from the preliminary reading of 52 5  where it was expected to remain  but below the 53 3 level posted in July  A reading above 50 denotes expansion  The release is independent and differs from ISM s manufacturing report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently 
The final August University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index was revised lower to 96 8 from the preliminary level of 97 6  versus forecasts of 97 5  But the index is up solidly versus July s level of 93 4  Compared to last month  the expectations component of the report was higher  though the current conditions portion declined  The 1 year and 5 10 year inflation outlooks held at July s 2 6  and 2 5  rates  respectively

Treasuries were lower following the plethora of data  as the yield on the 2 Year note ticked 1 basis point  bp  higher to 1 33   while the yields on the 10 Year note and the 30 Year bond rose 5 bps to 2 16  and 2 77   respectively  Bond yields showed some relative signs of life after being quiet as of late  while the U S  dollar index reversed to the upside  continuing to show signs of stabilization after recently hitting multi year lows

167624,389140,BBY,BBY Best Buy Earnings Report  Weekly Elliott Wave Count,opinion,"Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY  earnings report due to this week  the 29th of August  Before we get into the details few words about the company we are about to analyze 
According to Wikipedia  Best Buy Co   NYSE  NYSE BBY   Inc  is an American multinational consumer electronics corporation headquartered in Richfield  Minnesota  a Minneapolis suburb  Internationally  it also operates in Canada and Mexico  It was formerly operational in China until February 2011  when the faction was merged with Five Star  and in Europe until 2012  According to  Yahoo  Finance  Best Buy is the largest specialty retailer in the U S  consumer electronics retail industry 
Regarding earning  Best Buy Co   Inc  is expected to report earnings the 29th of August 2017 before market open  The report will be for the fiscal Quarter ending Jul 2017  According to Zacks Investment Research  based on 12 analysts  forecasts  the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is  0 63  The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was  0 57 Overall view  Best Buy  NYSE  BBY  shares are surging this year  a company many investors though was in big trouble because of the threat from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   The stock is up by 55  this year and up by approximately 240  since the company named Hubert Joly as its CEO five years ago 
Main reasons why BBY Best Buy has been surging 
The Nintendo Switch console launch
Best Buy proved Amazon proof in contrast with Circuit City and RadioShack
Despite the very encouraging data  it is worth to mention that the BBY stock is well behind AMZN s performance  Since August 2012  AMZN stock is up by 300  yet if we account the S P 500 is up by 75  during the same time frame and while the SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  has risen only 25   BBY Best Buy still has an astonishing performance 
Coming back to the Earnings subject  Jefferies raised Best Buy Sales and Earnings estimates on Tuesday for the second quarter  citing strength in the video game  appliance and smartphone categories  Based on our field checks and other research  we believe Best Buy should be able to grow domestic SSS  same store sales  at the high end or better than mgmt  s plan   analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a note to clients   We expect Best Buy to benefit from strength in appliances and connected home  however we also expect robust growth in entertainment from the introduction of two gaming consoles in Q1 and mobile to benefit from a full quarter of Samsung  KS 005930  S8 S8  availability   We believe that Best Buy s entertainment category saw a second consecutive quarter of robust growth driven by the launch of the Nintendo Switch and the 1TB PlayStation Slim Gold console as the company laps fairly significant comparable store sales declines in this category   he wrote 
As a result  the analyst raised his July quarter Best Buy U S  same store sales growth estimate to 2 5 percent from 2 0 percent  He also increased his earnings per share forecast for the same quarter to 66 cents from 59 cents versus the Wall Street consensus of 63 cents 
Our View in ElliottWave Forecast com
When it comes to our BBY s stock price analysis  Best Buy is still a buy in the dip on the weekly time frame while still missing the minimum target of the 70 s level  The 70 s price target is the equal legs of the  w     x  swing since the stock first started trading  The rally since 12 2012 as well seems incomplete  Price took the equal legs at the 56 s zone but RSI yet to show divergence  a fact suggesting we are most likely going to see the next level at the 1 236  extension around the 66 s  just 4  from the equal legs at 70 s mentioned above 
 BBY Best Buy Weekly Elliott Wave CountAt this stage we would like to see price correcting down to the 56 s zone where the supporting trend line since 06 01 16 is holding  From there we expect price to bounce and ideally extend to new highs towards our target or at least create a 3 wave bounce which should provide longs the ability to get Risk Free",2017-08-28,Elliott Wave Forecast,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bby-best-buy-earnings-report--weekly-elliottwave-count-200209943,200209943
167625,389141,BBY,What Is Going On With Best Buy  BBY  Stock Today ,opinion,"On Tuesday  shares of electronics and appliance retailer Best Buy Co    NYSE BBY   are plummeting  down about 11  in morning trading after the company reported its latest quarterly earnings results 
Interestingly  Best Buy posted strong results across the board  Earnings of 69 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents per share and grew 21  from the prior year period  net income was  209 million  Revenues came in at  8 94 billion  also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 66 billion 
Same store sales  in particular  rose 5 4  year over year  much better than the expected 2 2  growth  Online comparable sales surged roughly 31  compared to the growth rate of 23 7  seen a year ago  thanks to faster shipping  improvements to its online checkout process  and enhanced search functionality attracted more customers 
Comps were also driven by heightened consumer demand for technology  especially wearable devices  laptops  and gaming consoles 
However  CEO Hubert Joly  his company s current mid single digit rise in comparable sales would continue  saying on a call with analysts these same store sales results  did not represent a new normal  
These remarks  in turn  have raised concerns about whether or not Best Buy s recent turnaround is as maintainable as it seems  worry seen in BBY s performance today 
This turnaround included strategies like closing underperforming stores  matching Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   prices  and improving customer service  Best Buy was able to reinvigorate declining sales and profits  and is one of the only electronics companies that can say it has beaten analyst estimates in six of the past eight quarters  while its competitors hhgregg and RadioShack have gone bankrupt 
Best Buy now expects full year revenue to rise about 4  compared to earlier guidance that of only a 2 5  increase  The consumer electronics retailer also expects income growth of 4  to 9   higher than its previous forecast of 3 5  to 8 5  growth 
Best Buy In Depth
Since the start of 2017  shares of Best Buy have gained over 46   and in the past one year  the electronics retailer stock is up over 60   BBY is currently a  2  Buy  on the Zacks Rank  with a VGM score of  A   The company is in a high performing industry as well  and  has returned over 39  year to date  sitting in the top 5  of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank 
Its P E of 16 04 falls in line with its industry s  though Best Buy still trades below the S P 500  However  if you look at the company s performance over the last three years  you ll see not only see Best Buy s turnaround start taking effect  but you ll also notice its valuation slowly begin to rise as a result 
While investor sentiment rightfully took a downturn in the wake of Mr  Joly s statement  Best Buy is still one of the more expensive retail stocks out there  This higher valuation  though  is because the company is doing something right  Because of its niche inventory and dedication to customer needs  i e  fast shipping and installation services  Best Buy has been able to compete with Amazon where others have failed 
Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking Secret
Since 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars

167648,389164,BBY,Zacks com Featured Highlights FormFactor  Best Buy  Five9  Zynga And FireEye,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 24  2017   Stocks in this week s article include FormFactor Inc   NASDAQ     NASDAQ FORM        Best Buy Co  Inc     NYSE BBY       Five9 Inc     NASDAQ FIVN       Zynga Inc     NASDAQ ZNGA       andFireEye Inc     NASDAQ FEYE      Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks Sizzling with Strong Earnings Beat ProspectsInvestors are always hunting for estimate beating stocks before an earnings release  It is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality and have high chances of beating earnings estimates Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher How to Locate Potential Outperformers  Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release   The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 12 Here are five out of 12 stocks that passed the screen FormFactor Inc   NASDAQ

167672,389188,BBY,Back To School  2 Stocks To Profit From Record High College Shopping ,opinion,"We are halfway through August  and parents and young people around the country are preparing to pack up and head off to college  So Zacks is here to look at two companies with huge exposure in the college shopping market that also happen to have high Zacks Ranks 
As most students and parents know  going back to school shopping can be very expensive  For elementary and high school students the costs are enormous  But parents and kids headed back to college or for the first time know that the costs are much higher  In fact  overall back to school spending for college students is almost double that of K 12 
Notebooks  backpacks  and new clothes are expensive  but laptops  speakers  futons  and microwaves cost a whole lot more 
K 12 back to school spending is projected to jump 8  to  29 5 billion  according to a National Retail Federation   However  college kids and their families are expected to spend a total of  54 1 billion on back to school related shopping  which is up from  48 5 billion in 2016 
The 2017 college spending projections place this year ahead of the previous high water mark reached in 2012  The staggering figure is due in part to a rise in college enrollment  along with reviewed consumer confidence but also because big ticket purchases and the sheer amount of goods just add up 
Now  let s take a look at two big name companies with high Zacks Ranks that could turn college student spending into major profits 
Best Buy  BBY  
Best Buy   NYSE BBY   is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that scored an  A  for Value and a  B  for growth in our Style Score system  The electronics powerhouse has a market cap of  18 5 billion and a forward PE of 15 61 
Best Buy s estimated earnings   which is far above the industry average of 3   Shares of Best Buy have skyrocketed from  32 32 a share a year ago to rest at over  60 per share today  which is only a few dollars below its 52 week high 
Best Buy s massive climb has been spurred in part by the company s commitment to grow its online sales  In the most recent quarter  the company s domestic online comparable sales jumped by 22 5  from the year ago period 
The company which sells computers  printers  TVs  tablets  video game consoles and more could really cash in on the back to college market  Based on the National Retail Federation report  electronics will be the top spending sector out of all of the back to school related categories at  12 8 billion 
Wal Mart  WMT 
Wal Mart   NYSE WMT   is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an overall VGM grade of   A   The we sell everything retailer s current market cap sits at  244 billion  and the company is coming off a solid second quarter earnings report 
Wal Mart beat earnings and revenue expectations  and even   The company posted adjusted earnings of  1 08 per share  which just topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and prior year quarter s adjusted earnings of  1 07 
On top of that small beat  the company posted revenues that were up 2 1  year over year to  123 4 billion  which also surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimate  Walmart U S  same store sales climbed 1 9   while Sam s Club comparable store sales gained 1 2  
Maybe more importantly  management noted that the company s online sales and GMV climbed 60  and 67   respectively 
Shares of Wal Mart dipped on Thursday despite its strong report  but that seems to have more to do with the overall market than Wal Mart  The company s stock currently sits  2 below its 52 week high of  81 99 a share 
Bottom Line
Back to school college shopping is a big time moneymaker for many retail outlets around the country  Best Buy and Wal Mart are both major names with large exposure in this highly coveted early fall spending spree 
One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars

Ltd   OTCMKTS   OTC TCEHY      as the Bull of the Day  Sturm  Ruger   Company  Inc  NYSE   NYSE RGR       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onBest Buy  NYSE   NYSE BBY       and Wal Mart  NYSE   NYSE WMT       Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  Tencent Holdings Ltd  OTCMKTS      just reported one of its strongest quarters ever  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is at the top of the heap among China s Internet giants Tencent is one of China s leading online gaming and media companies  However  it has been expanding its business in other key areas  including mobile payment with Weixin Payment  and the Cloud It now has a market cap of  411 billion  putting it up near the largest companies on the planet A Huge Second QuarterOn Aug 16  Tencent reported second quarter and first half results  It beat the Zacks Consensus by 2 cents reporting  0 23 versus  0 21 Second quarter revenue rose 59  to  8 4 billion with net profit up 45  The quarter was boosted by growth in Weixin Payment  Cloud and AI technologies Online gaming is its bread and butter  however  and it rose 39  primarily due to its smart phone games  This was the first quarter in the company s history that mobile game revenue exceeded PC game revenue Social network revenue jumped 51  as WeChat  its social messaging app  saw a 20  gain in active monthly users to 960 million Online ad revenue was up 55  due to higher traffic to Tencent video Gross margin was the one weak area  as it fell to 50  from 57 3  a year ago due to investments in video and other new emerging technologies Estimates Move HigherIt s not surprising  given the great quarter  that full year estimates are already on the move higher The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to  1 03 from  0 94 in the last week  That s an astounding earnings growth of 61  year over year Analysts are equally bullish on 2018  as they see another year of double digit earnings growth  up 29  Shares Soar in 2017The big gains from Chinese Internet companies in the first half of the year are a sign that the Chinese economy is re awakening Shares of Tencent are up 73  year to date  Sturm  Ruger   Company  Inc  NYSE      is facing tough times under President Trump  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has seen sales and earnings decline by the double digits in 2017 due mostly to politics Sturm  Ruger is one of the largest firearm manufacturers in the US  It makes 400 variations through 30 product lines Sales Drop Big in the Second QuarterOn Aug 2  Sturm Ruger reported second quarter results and missed big on the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Sturm Ruger reported  0 57 compared to the Zacks Consensus of  1 11  That s a miss of 49  Net sales fell 22  to  131 9 million from  167 9 million a year ago If you recall  2016 saw stronger than normal demand during the Presidential election cycle due to fears by gun enthusiasts that Hillary Clinton would win the White House and put gun restrictions on buyers  Remember  this was the same fear that emerged in 2008 after Barack Obama won The 2008 2016 period resulted in record gun sales Since Trump won in November 2016  sales have fallen The estimated unit sell through of Sturm Ruger s products from the independent distributors to retailers decreased 13  in the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016  For the same period  the National Instant Criminal Background Check System saw a 7  decrease in background checks Retailers have also been reducing inventories and trying to generate cash for the typically slower summer season The gun sales slowdown is impacting the entire industry which has also resulted in Sturm s competitors applying sharp price discounting and offering lucrative consumer rebates Estimates Being CutThere s no reason to think that gun sales are dramatically going to turn around any time soon  The analysts have been cutting 2017 and 2018 estimates as a result The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to  3 69 from  4 37 just 90 days ago  It made  4 59 in 2016 so that s an earnings decline of 19 6  2018 is expected to be a bit better than 2017  but estimates have been cut there in the last 3 months to  4 17 from  4 63 Shares Sink 7 6  in 2017It s been a roller coaster ride over the past 2 years and right now  shares are on a downward slide Additional content Back to School  2 Stocks to Profit from

167694,389210,BBY,Not All Retail Stocks Will Be Crushed By Amazon,opinion,"We all know that Amazon  AMZN  is killing the hopes and dreams of many stocks in many sectors   Retail has easily been one of the hardest hit sectors   The stocks in that industry have been facing the wrath of Amazon for the last several years  but it is the tide about to turn 
Presidential tweets have put AMZN on blast and maybe now is the time to take a look at some competitors as money managers may look to move some assets from the retail leader to some other names in the space 
With this in mind  I checked to see the strongest retailing industry and I was surprised to see consumer electronics to be in the top 2  of all industries covered by the Zacks Industry Rank

Estimates for AAN have been increasing   The company has seen estimates move from  2 29 to  2 41 over the last 90 days   The 2018 number has also moved higher  to  2 55 to  2 72 over the same time period 
AAN has also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters   The big idea is that the percentage of positive earnings surprise has been increasing   Four quarters ago the company posted a beat of 3 5   then 6 4   The new two quarters saw beats of 11  and then 21   That is just what investors like to see 
Zacks Rank  2  Buy 
Conn s  CONN  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and also sports growth and value style scores of  A   Like AAN  this company has also posted four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The average positive earnings surprise over that time span has been 80  and that is a huge number 
Part of the reason for the big surprise is the fact that the company is seeing smaller than expected losses  Over the time period of the last four reports  the stock has more than doubled from below  10 to more than  22 today

Not All Retail Stocks Will Be Crushed by Amazon

	We all know that Amazon  NASDAQ        is killing the hopes and dreams of many stocks in many sectors  Retail has easily been one of the hardest hit sectors  The stocks in that industry have been facing the wrath of Amazon for the last several years  but it is the tide about to turn 

	Presidential tweets have put AMZN on blast and maybe now is the time to take a look at some competitors as money managers may look to move some assets from the retail leader to some other names in the space 

	With this in mind  I checked to see the strongest retailing industry and I was surprised to see consumer electronics to be in the top 2  of all industries covered by the Zacks Industry Rank

5 Top Ranked Stocks Emerge as DuPont  NYSE DD  Winners

	Return on equity is one of the most sought after metrics for an investment  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 

	To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze the basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 

	ROE   Net Income Equity
	Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
	ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierImportance of Du Pont
	Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 

	In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 

	So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 

	Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 

Screening Parameters
	  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE 
	  Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales 
	  Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets 
	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment 
	  Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed 
	Here are five of 20 stocks that made it through the screen 

Sanderson Farms Inc    NASDAQ            This Zacks Rank  1 company is a poultry processing company  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 5   You can see     

American Woodmark Corp    NASDAQ           The Zacks Rank  2 company manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for remodeling  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 18  

TJX Companies Inc    NYSE           It is the leading off price retailer of apparel and home fashion in the U S  and worldwide  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 18   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2

167747,389263,BBY,Expect Dow Jones Above 22 000 In The Coming Weeks,opinion,"Not unexpected  the Dow Jones made new all time highs on the last three trading days of last week  The number of BEV Zeros the Dow has made since the November election increases weekly  Since the elections  there have been 169 NYSE trading sessions  of which 42  25  or 1 in 4  have seen the Dow Jones close at a new all time high  Looking at all the BEV Zeros in the plot below  since last October  it s been a hot market 

However  it s also been a long time since the Dow Jones has seen a double digit correction  Jan Feb 2016   or when it found itself 5  or more from a last all time high  last summer   This won t go on forever  and the market may be more than just a little shocked when it realizes that it takes a 1 082 point decline before the Dow Jones corrects just 5  
Look at the table below  It takes a 2 164 point decline before the Dow Jones sees a double digit correction  That will freak out everyone at CNBC  But what s freaking me out is that the Dow Jones now finds itself at the door step of breaking above 22 000 
The Dow Jones step sum chart below looks very positive  Since March  its step sum has fallen behind the rising price plot  creating a bull box  Now it appears the step sum  market sentiment  is once again becoming as positive as the Dow Jones  rising price plot  Just looking at what I see below  I expect the daily advances for the Dow Jones to begin overwhelming the daily declines in the weeks ahead of us  a rising step sum plot   That will close the bull box and should give the Dow Jones a nice little boost upward as this happens 
But after it does  what then  It s too early for us to think of that  Let s see how far above 22 000 the Dow Jones can go before it tops out 

It s not just the Dow Jones that s been making history since the November elections  The other major indexes are doing very good too  At the close of this week s trading  twelve of the major market indexes I follow also closed at new all time highs  and most of the rest are just a whisker from making one 
But the gains seen in the past two years are less than I d expected  Maybe we shouldn t read too much into that as the only important point to make of this data is that these indexes are going up 

But the question is how much longer can an advance that began in March 2009 continue  Maybe longer than any of us can imagine  That said  I m still curious about what happens come September   October  We ll see another  debt crisis  in the US Treasury if Congress doesn t raise the Treasury s debt ceiling  That s usually a hard time for the stock market 
But if they do raise the debt ceiling  as they always do   how can having a national debt increase to over 20 trillion dollars not also be described as a debt crisis  What is the government spending all this money on  They don t tell us  as they know we wouldn t approve 
This is a bad situation  where ahead of us all is a dark alley where one day Mr Bear will greet everyone with a great big bear hug  But when 
Let s look at the Dow Jones Total Market Groups  DJTMG   first the new all time highs  Keep in mind that currently there are 153 groups in the DJTMG  of which I only use 74 in the series below  I can t help it  Since 1988  there have been many changes to this market series  each creating complications in my files and in my life  I finally said to heck with it  Just because the Dow Jones Inc  makes a change  doesn t mean I have to follow  So  since 1992 it s been 74 groups  and 74 groups it s going to stay  It s still good data 
This week  the DJTMG groups I follow saw 15 new all time highs  and as you can see in the table in the chart below  it saw 29 not all that long ago  in Barron s June 5th issue  This series should peak  and then decline as a bear market approaches  Seeing a 29 just a few weeks ago  two and a half years after it last saw a 29 in December 2014  is a bit unusual  Obviously the  policy makers  aren t willing to allow their market bubble to deflate  not yet anyways 

I know I must make some people groan with my talking about the  policy makers  doing this and the  policy makers  doing that  But that s the way it is 
Here s the DJTMG s 52Wk High   Low performance  76 groups   don t even ask    I bring to your attention  40  Retail Broadline  I keep seeing news about store closings for Sears  NASDAQ SHLD   JC Penney  NYSE JCP   Best Buy  NYSE BBY  and Walmart  NYSE WMT   I can drive around my community and see all the store closings and empty strip malls  Retail in July 2017 is in a horrible situation 
So  how can the DJTMG s Retail group be only 1 52  from its 52Wk high  and up 21  from its 52Wk Low with all these store closings  I expect it s a  policy  thing 

Also  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  has become the all consuming beast in retail  a beast that s doing to Walmart  what Walmart did to everyone else in retail 
But then  Amazon s Jeff Bezos is just someone who people enjoy doing nice things for  First  Wall Street gives him  300 million to purchase the dying Washington Post so it can continue maligning President Trump  then the CIA gives him a  600 million dollar contract for cloud services  I m not surprised the US Post Office is also giving Jeff s retail business a  1 46 subsidy on every box it ships  wouldn t you for Jeff 

This is the world we live in 
And I expect there are lots of economic statistics  published by the government for public consumption  statistics that are never questioned by the financial media that are as divorced from reality as the DJTMG s Retail Broadline group below  The same can be said for  41  Auto Manufactures  and  42  Broadcasting   and most likely many other groups in the table  But as long as the stock market continues going up  all is right with the world   right 
Here are the DJTMG s top 20  or the number of groups above within 20  of their last all time highs  The top 20 has been stuck in the mid to low 40s since last July  It can t go up  and won t go down  Technically speaking  the top 20 is stuck  and since 1992  that hasn t happen very often 

Here is the frequency table where I derive the new all time highs and the top 20 data for the DJTMG  There s some churning between the groups in the BEV Zero to the  5  columns  but the top 20 column for the most part is stuck between 44 and 48 since February  really since last July 
What do I make of this  Looking at the past twenty five years in the chart above  it appears that our  bull market  is being managed by the usual suspects 

But if you re in the market and making money  why should you care  Well  you shouldn t  I m a big bear on the stock market  but short term I m pretty bullish  So if you re making money  keep doing what you re doing  Just remember  its times like this when it makes more sense to look for reasons to sell  than to find reasons to buy more of what you have 
Moving to gold and its step sum  it appears that contrary to what I said last week  both the price of gold and its step sum are in the early phases of reversing to the upside 

But the increase in the price of gold seen above is only from a one day advance  seen on Friday  today   table below   After a big decline that lasted a few trading weeks  seeing a one day bounce is not unexpected  So  it s good seeing gold getting a nice bounce  but I m still expecting lower gold prices in the days and maybe weeks to come 
I hope I m wrong  No one would be happier than me seeing gold close over  1270 on Friday next week  But markets work in cycles  I m looking at gold s step sum in the table below  and since June 9th  25 trading days ago  it s remained around 242 the entire time as the price of gold has fallen  50  It s a bear box 
Until the bulls  once again  are able to get more out of their advancing days than the bears in their declining days  this pattern isn t going to change  So  I m still short term bearish on gold 

The story the Dow Jones  step sum is telling us in the table above is completely different  Like gold  it s step sum has been stuck between 439 to 443 for weeks  but the Dow Jones has been advancing  And now it appears its step sum will break above 443 next week  If this happens  the Dow Jones most likely is entering into a period where it will see more advancing days than decliners IN AN ADVANCING MARKET 
If this happens  and it should  it won t be hard for the Dow Jones to break above 22 000 in the weeks to come ",2017-07-16,Mark Lundeen,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/expect-dow-jones-above-22,000-in-the-coming-weeks-200201359",200201359

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Have Faith in DuPont  NYSE DD  Analysis  Buy 5 Top Ranked Stocks

	If you have to isolate profit churners from profit burners  return on equity will come across to you as one of the most appropriate metrics  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 

	But ROE doesn t tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number  If you closely look at the components of ROE  you will be surprised to see that it can be high for the wrong reasons as well  Here comes the DuPont technique which helps investors to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  This is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 

	ROE   Net Income Equity
	Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
	ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier

Why Use DuPont 

	The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 

	In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 

	So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 

	Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 

Screening Parameters


	  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE 
	  Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales 
	  Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets 
	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment 
	  Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed 
	Here are five of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen

167772,389288,BBY,Are GameStop s Revival Plans Enough To Pull It Out Of Woods ,opinion,The year so far has turned out to be an eventful one for Retail Consumer Electronic industry  Year to date  the industry has witnessed a sharp gain of 27 4   Stocks such as Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    Conn s  Inc    NASDAQ CONN   and Systemax Inc    NYSE SYX   which belong to the aforementioned industry have surged 35 6   43 8  and 115 7   respectively However  GameStop Corp    NYSE GME   also part of the same industry has faltered  evident from its fall of 17 2   So after observing the company s stock performance  the first question which comes to our mind is why GameStop is lagging behind the industry and how much time will it take to match the industry s performance  Let s delve deeper GameStop Vs Industry ScorecardDrab View   Dismal New Software Sales Hurt StockDespite reporting better than expected first quarter fiscal 2017 results  the company retained the outlook which investors did not welcome  This can be attributed to the delay in the launch of  Red Dead Redemption  2  and less visibility for the demand of Nintendo Switch for the entire year  GameStop doesn t expect  Red Dead Redemption  2  to be launched this fiscal year  The company continues to anticipate fiscal 2017 comps to be in the range of flat to down 5   For the fiscal year  management also reiterated earnings forecast of  3 10  3 40 per share  which is considerably lower than  3 77 and  3 90 delivered in fiscal 2016 and 2015 Further  we note that the bottom line continues to decline year over year  Earnings per share had declined 2 9   12 9   9 3  and 0 8  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016  In first quarter fiscal 2017  it declined 4 5   The reflection of the same is evident from the stock s dismal run GameStop s basic concern is the weakness prevailing in new software sales  which is heightening apprehensions about the impact of digital downloads on the same  New software sales witnessed 8 2  decline in the first quarter  During fourth quarter fiscal 2016 conference call  the company stated that it expects new software sales to decline mid single digits in fiscal 2017 Revival StrategyThough the stock has underperformed the industry in the recent times  the stock has all the ingredients to outpace the industry  Both Technology Brands   Collectibles Business are growing at a very rapid speed and can help the company regain its lost position  During the fiscal first quarter  the collectibles business sales surged 39 1  to  114 5 million buoyed by robust sales of Pok mon related products  The company added nine Collectibles stores during the quarter  taking the total count to 95 stores  We noted that in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2016  collectibles brands sales jumped 27 8  and 37 3   respectively Meanwhile  in the first quarter fiscal 2017 Technology Brands sales jumped 21 5  to  201 4 million driven by year over year growth in AT T  NYSE T  authorized retail stores  Technology Brands sales has improved 43 9   54 4   54 6  and 62 2  in the fourth  third  second and first quarter of fiscal 2016  Management anticipates sturdy performance of Technology Brands and Collectibles to continue in fiscal 2017  Management also anticipates Technology Brands  operating earnings to rise over 30  to  120 million during fiscal 2017 and to be  200 million in fiscal 2019  During fourth quarter fiscal 2016 conference call  the company stated that it expects Technology Brands sales to increase 10 16  in fiscal 2017 GameStop expects to enhance collectibles business approximately  650  700 million during fiscal 2017 and anticipates becoming a  1 billion business by the end of fiscal 2019  In the second quarter  Collectibles sales are forecasted to increase by 35 40   The company remains optimistic about non physical gaming businesses and expects this category to reach approximately 50  of operating earnings by the end of fiscal 2019 ConclusionDismal New software sales  delay in launch of  Red Dead Redemption  2  and less visibility for the demand of Nintendo Switch for the entire year are no doubt are causes of worry for investors right now  However  robust performance of both Technology Brands and Collectibles along with management s optimistic view about both these segments may help in offsetting the laggards GameStop currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think

167796,389312,BBY,JC Penney Down 48  In 6 Months  What Are The Chances Of Revival ,opinion,"The impact of challenging retail landscape  stiff competition from online retailers and waning store traffic is clearly evident from J  C  Penney Company  Inc  s   NYSE JCP    share performance that have underperformed the industry in the past six  months  The stock has declined 47 9   wider than the Zacks categorized  industry s fall of 35   Let s delve deeper and find out what s ailing it 
The company s weaker than expected top line performance in the trailing five quarters has been a major concern  Further  weakness in apparel continues to affect the company s overall sales  Moreover  comparable store sales  comps  decreased 3 5  in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  compared with a decline of 0 4  in the prior year quarter 
Comps also declined in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2016  by 0 7  and 0 8   respectively  In fiscal 2017  the company anticipates comps to be in the range of down 1  to up 1  
Moreover  J  C  Penney continues to struggle with high debt levels  At the end of the reported quarter  total long term debt was  4 066 million  reflecting a debt to capitalization ratio of 77 1  

Can the Stock Revive 
However  the company s shares have declined a meager 0 4  in the past month  which is an indication of possible recovery if the company continues to implement effective strategies

Further  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has taken up several strategic initiatives to drive traffic  The company  in a bid to enhance customer shopping experience  has been focusing on remodeling  renovating and refurbishing stores with special focus on enhancing high margin center core department that houses handbags  fashion accessories  sunglasses and fashion jewelry

167797,389313,BBY,Coach Gains 20  In 3 Months Despite Headwinds  Here s Why,opinion,"The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change  With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online  store and mall traffic has been hit hard  As a result  most retailers  including big box  are struggling to compete with e commerce channels and are being forced to trim their store count to focus more on an online model 
Amid such a scenario  Coach  Inc    NYSE COH   has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around products  stores and marketing to pull itself back on the growth trajectory and emerge as a multi brand company  The company s long term earnings growth rate of 10 6  also reflects its inherent potential 
Despite the prevailing headwinds  Coach has exhibited a bullish run in the index in the past three months  The stock has not only outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry but also the broader sector  The stock has increased 20   while the industry advanced 4 1   Meanwhile  the broader  sector gained 3 4  What Are the Factors Driving Growth 
As one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts  Coach boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance sales output through product innovation  a compelling pricing strategy  new merchandise assortments and a cost effective global sourcing model 
We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable store sales and operating margins in the long term  The company s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under penetrated markets 

Coach is undergoing a brand transformation and is introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets  The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman has been accretive to performance and is being viewed as a significant step in its efforts toward becoming a multi brand company  The recent agreement to acquire to Kate Spade   Company for  2 4 billion is another step taken in that direction  Additionally  it is aggressively expanding e commerce platform 
The company s strategic endeavors helped it post 13th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise when it reported third quarter fiscal 2017 results  Moreover  Coach registered positive comparable store sales at its North American segment for the fourth straight quarter 
Moreover  the company witnessed healthy growth across directly operated Europe and Mainland China operations  Management continues to project double digit growth in earnings per share during fiscal 2017  Further  the company expects operating margin between 18 5  and 19  for the fiscal year 
Hurdles to Overcome
Due to strengthening of the U S  dollar  management now envisions low single digit increase in fiscal 2017 revenue  Third quarter net sales came in at  995 2 million  down about 4  on a reported basis and 3  on a constant currency basis  Sales growth were hurt by 150 basis points on account of management s efforts to elevate the Coach brand s positioning in the North American wholesale channel by lowering promotional events and door closures  We noted that the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 018 million  marking the third straight quarter of revenue miss 
Coach sells products that are discretionary in nature  and in turn depends upon consumers  disposable income  The company s customers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors  which if not favorable may negatively impact their discretionary spending  and in turn the company s growth and profitability 
Given the pros and cons embedded  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks that Warrant a Look
Investors may consider better ranked stocks such as Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp    NASDAQ BGFV   and The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    All the three stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Best Buy delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 33 8  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 11 8  
Big 5 Sporting Goods delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 94 5  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 9  
Children s Place delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 36 6  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 8

167798,389314,BBY,The Fed Needs To Rethink Their 2  Inflation Target,opinion,"For what seems like forever  the Fed has been saying they are using a 2  inflation target  Given this expansion s weak growth  this seems to be a fair and appropriate number 
But intuition can be deceiving  The San Francisco Federal Reserve has issued several reports showing the natural rate of interest to be right around 0  which tells us the natural rate of inflation is probably below 2   Despite an unemployment rate below 5   wage growth is also weak  While this means the Phillips curve is at best very flat  it also means inflation expectations on the part of employees and employers are very low 
And  argues that the rise of global value chains also helps to contain inflation  Here  I will argue two other economic developments weak energy prices and the development of technology are also containing inflation  The sum total of all this information is clear  the Fed needs to rethink its 2  inflation target 
Energy Prices
The following graph of West Texas Intermediate Crude shows that energy prices are contained 

WTIC has traded between the upper 30s and lower 50s for the better part of year  Before that  prices dropped as OPEC opened the production spigots in an effort to undercut the U S  fracking market   a tactic that was originally successful  But over the last few years  

After falling in 2015 and 2016  US shale oil production is tipped by the US Energy Information Administration to hit a record next month of 5 475m barrels a day   surpassing the peak hit two years ago before the full force of the price slump was felt 
The young industry has shown it can squeeze down costs and now compete when prices are near  50 a barrel 

In addition  Libya and Nigeria have   lessening the impact of OPEC s cuts 
The excess supply has contained energy prices  which are now dropping sharply 

It s possible the energy component of CPI will turn negative Y Y within the next 6 9 months  This would  in turn  negatively impact prices 
The Amazon Effect 
 This theory was recently advanced by Chicago Fed President Evans  

Evans  a voter on the Federal Open Market Committee this year who supported its decision to raise interest rates last week  says he is less confident than most of his colleagues that inflation will soon rise to their 2 percent target 
A big reason for his ambivalence  Deflationary competitive pressures could have become more important for the overall trend in prices than the so called Phillips Curve relationship  which links inflation to the state of the labor market  That model  coined almost 60 years ago  is the basis for the Fed s outlook for continued gradual rate increases 
 We know that technology is disruptive  It s changing a number of business models that used to be very successful  and you have to wonder if certain economic actors can continue to maintain their price margins  or if they are under threat from additional competition   he said   And that could be an undercurrent for holding back inflation  

To my knowledge  there is no study on this effect  But that doesn t mean it s not real  Consider how quickly and efficiently consumers can investigate prices  They typically start online   probably at Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  or another internet based retailer   where prices are already low  They can then order the product online  bypassing the brick and mortar retailer  Or consider the smart phone app that allows a consumer to scan a bar code at a store and then determine if a retailer close to that location has that product at a lower price  The consumer s ability to thoroughly investigate prices is a big reason why large retailers like Best Buy  NYSE BBY  whose annual gross income has declined since 2012 are in trouble  And it also supports Evans  contention that technology s disruptive impact is limiting companies  pricing power 
Recently  a group of economists wrote  to the Federal Reserve  asking them to reconsider their 2  inflation target  The letter was well reasoned and presented  Most importantly  they were right   the Fed desperately needs to reconsider their inflation target  Because the current data indicates prices will be contained for some time ",2017-06-25,Hale Stewart,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fed-has-to-rethink-their-2-inflation-target-200197277,200197277

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Pick 5 Top Ranked Profitable Stocks Using DuPont  NYSE DD  Analysis 

	Return on equity  ROE  is one of the top ratios that investors use to screen profitable stocks  However  delving into the basic ROE and analyzing it at a deeper level  with the help of DuPont analysis  could lead to better returns 

	It is an analytical method  which critically examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Although it can be presented in several ways  the most popular one is shown below 

	ROE   Net Income Equity
	Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
	ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont 
	The importance of ROE can t be denied but still it doesn t always provide a complete picture The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
	In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden 
	So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective will be at a loss if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  DuPont analysis comes to the rescue and finds out the better stock  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three metrics   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring 
	DuPont analysis is not difficult  as the required numbers are available in a company s income statement and balance sheet 
	However  looking at the financial statements of each and every company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive based on DuPont analysis 

Screening Parameters

	  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE 
	  Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales 
	  Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets 
	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment 
	  Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed 
	Here are five of 12 stocks that made it through the screen 

Nutrisystem Inc    NASDAQ        This Zacks Rank  1 company is a provider of weight management products and services  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 13   You can see     

American Woodmark Corporation   NASDAQ        The Zacks Rank  2 company manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for remodeling  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 31  

Five Below Inc    NASDAQ        It is a specialty value retailer offering merchandise for teen and pre teen customers in the U S  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 31   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 

Best Buy Co  Inc    NYSE        The company is a leading retailer  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1 and has a VGM score of A  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 1

167841,389357,BBY,Here s Why Kirkland s  KIRK  Is A Risky Investment,opinion,"Kirkland s  Inc    NASDAQ KIRK   performance has been quite disappointing lately owing to waning store traffic and difficult consumer spending environment  Although the company has undertaken few initiatives to revive itself  they have yet to show any sturdy positive impacts 
Let s now look deeper into the factors that have been holding down Kirkland s performance  and also check if any remedial measures are put on track by the company to improve it 
Dismal First Quarter Results
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017  the company posted a loss of 9 cents per share  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 4 cents  The reported figure was also down from adjusted earnings of 6 cents in the prior year quarter  Higher cost of sales  operating expenses and lower comparable store sales  comps  caused these losses  In fact  the company posted losses in three out of the trailing four quarters 
Net sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew just 2 3  year over year  owing to an increase in the number of store count 
To further add to the company s troubles  shares of Kirkland have fallen 30 1   in the past year compared to the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 4 1  

Major concerns 
Kirkland s has been incurring higher operating expenses for several quarters due to increase in store occupancy costs  These costs resulted from increased shipping  higher store payroll  benefits expense and planned increases in advertising costs and packaging expenses  All of the above factors have pressurized margins and the company s bottom line performance in the past few quarters 
Kirkland s is reporting lower comparable store sales for the past few quarters as more people are resorting to online purchases  In order to match up with the trend  the company is also focusing on e Commerce  but is still trailing way behind stronger performers such as Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN    e Commerce expansion related expenses also add to the ongoing trend of surged operating expenses for the company 
While the company is expanding its stores to boost sales  the move might be a risky venture as it is expected to increase store occupancy costs further  The company s intention to expand the supply chain capabilities would further raise costs 
Measures Undertaken 
Kirkland s is focused on upgrading its information system to maintain growth and momentum in its e Commerce business  The company has redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution 
Kirkland s is closing the smaller underperforming stores in the malls and expects to open bigger off mall stores at popular locations which are likely to boost sales in the forthcoming quarters  The company has also undertaken several initiatives to improve merchandise and lower the inventory levels 
Bottom Line
Given the greater number of cons impacting Kirkland s performance  the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The improvement measures undertaken by the company are yet to deliver results and boost investor confidence  Dismal performance has also led the Zacks Consensus Loss Estimates for the second quarter fiscal 2017 to widen in the past 30 days from a loss of 27 cents to a loss of 28 cents 
Key Picks 
Investors may consider better ranked stocks such as Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   and Burlington Stores  Inc    NYSE BURL   each flaunting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Best Buy delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 33 8  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 11 8  
Burlington Stores delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 22 6  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 15 9

167842,389358,BBY,Deckers  DECK  Up Post Earnings  Will Momentum Last ,opinion,"Deckers Outdoor Corporation s   NYSE DECK   shares surged roughly 24  since the company released its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results  Shares of this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company grew 17  in the past month outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s increase of 1 3  
So what s driving this sturdy performance  Let s have a look into the company s recently reported fourth quarter results and its operational strategies  for gaining a deeper insight regarding this momentum 
Factors Impacting Performance 
The stock s surge was primarily driven by solid fourth quarter performance  This footwear and apparel retailer surprised investors by posting profit in the final quarter  Earnings for the quarter came in at 11 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents and management s earlier projection of a break even to a loss of 10 cents  
Deckers  cost containment efforts had led to this improved bottom line performance  The top line came ahead of our estimates  after missing the same in the preceding two quarters 
Improved performance of the company was driven by its well thought strategies that include targeting profitable markets  focusing on product innovations and store augmentation  Deckers  inclination towards expanding its brand assortments  targeting consumers digitally via marketing and sturdy eCommerce and optimizing omni channel distribution bodes well 

The company s store fleet optimization plan focuses on striking the right balance between digital and physical stores  Deckers plans to close approximately 30 to 40 outlets over the next two years  By fiscal 2020  it expects a company owned fleet of approximately 125 stores worldwide  
After ending fiscal 2017 on a high note  management expects cost savings of about  150 million on the back of improvement in cost of goods sold and SG A savings  which includes consolidation of retail outlets and process improvement efficiencies  This will help realize  100 million operating profit improvement by fiscal 2020  Management anticipates total sales of about  2 billion with operating margin of 13  by fiscal 2020 
Despite a strong bottom line performance in the previous quarter  Deckers  top line continues to decline year over year and management now expects fiscal 2018 net sales to be flat to down 2   The company s over reliance on the UGG brand is a matter of concern and requires the company to undertake stringent efforts to strengthen its other brand 
Bottom Line 
We believe that the company s strategic initiatives will propel the stock in the coming days  Influenced by strong fourth quarter performance and its policies  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter narrowed to a loss of  1 66 from  1 73  For fiscal 2018 the same improved by 31 cents to  4 08 
Deckers exhibits a  of  A  and has a long term earnings growth rate of 9 8   making us confident of the company s inherent strength 
Other Key Picks
Better ranked stocks worth considering in the retail space include Aaron s  Inc    NYSE AAN    Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   and The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    All these three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

167869,389385,BBY,A Disarming Calm Ahead Of Trifecta Thursday,opinion,"AT40   47 0  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   54 4  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   10 4  volatility index Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary At the time of typing  financial markets are carefully stepping into  Trifecta Thursday    or maybe not so carefully if measured by the volatility index  The VIX remained amazingly calm ahead of what has been heralded as a key meeting on monetary policy form the European Central Bank  ECB   testimony from former FBI Director James Comey on Russian election meddling and President Trump s potential connections to it  and a national election in the United Kingdom that is serving as yet another referendum on Brexit 
What worries  The volatility index  the VIX  is comfortably stuck near 14 year lows 
Contrary to the market s remarkable calm  I decided to buy a handful of call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  expiring next week  I did not bother hedging with put options since my stock positioning is heavily skewed to the long side  If volatility does manage to wake up  I plan to close out the UVXY call options quickly given my assumption the current period of extremely low volatility likely presages an overall calm summer 
The calm is of course reflected in an S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   that is just off another set of all time highs  Although this week started with an immediate reversal of the gains following last Friday s U S  jobs report  the index neatly bounced off the bottom of the upper Bollinger Band  BB  channel that defines the latest short term uptrend 

Despite small setbacks to start the week  the S P 500  SPY  is still in the middle of a robust bounceback from the one day sell off that broke 50DMA support three weeks ago 
While   T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   brought fresh credibility to the rally with a convincing show of breadth last week  my favorite technical indicator returned quickly to its over arching theme of wavering  AT40 closed last week at 55 3  and has lost ground for three straight trading days  It closed Wednesday at 47 0   The downtrending energy sector is likely a culprit once again 
Fresh weakness also appeared in retail stocks with Macy s Inc  NYSE M  taking a shellacking on Tuesday after reporting guidance tainted by weaker margins  The storied retailer is approaching a 7 year closing low  Over the last two years  Macy s has lost a whopping 68   Macy s helped drag the SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  right back to its low of the year and a near 52 week low 

The troubles at Macy s  M  seem to know no end 

The SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  has closed in on a new 52 week low 
On May 26th  electronics retailer Conns Inc  NASDAQ CONN  regained my attention after Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY  s stellar post earnings performance  I decided to wait for earnings before deciding to buy CONN  The stock went on to rally for the next five days going into earnings  The stock stumbled after reporting earnings  Before I could even think of buying this dip  CONN rallied off its post earnings low and then soared 9 9  on Wednesday to finish closing the gap down 
Stifel reiterated a buy rating on CONN and upped its price target from  19 to  20  This strong trading action suggests CONN is still a buy  preferably on dips   It is hard to believe that CONN was trading at less than half of its current trading level just two months ago  CONN is now back to a 15 month high 

Conn s  CONN  is enjoying quite the sudden renaissance 
Now I move on to see whether the market expresses any care or concern with Thursday s trifecta  I will be watching the currency markets more closely than the stock market  Currency markets more consistently care about the day to day  hour to hour news cycles

Consensus and EPS Surprise    On a reported basis  the company s earnings from continuing operations came in at 40 cents per share  up 48 1  from 27 cents posted in the year ago quarter  We note that

offsetting the unfavorable impact of food deflation Further  the segment s adjusted operating income came in at  33 1 million that improved 14 9  driven by higher organic sales and supply chain initiatives  These were partly mitigated by the unfavorable effect of the New Year s Day shift as well as deflation Military SegmentNet sales declined 4 6  to  643 3 million at the Military segment owing to decreased sales at the Defense Commissary Agency operated commissaries coupled with the New Year s Day shift Also  the segment s adjusted operating income totaled  1 0 million versus  3 7 million in the year ago quarter  The decline was a result of a fall in sales volume  rise in health care expenses  the unfavorable impact of the New Year s Day shift  as well as a large insurance claim Retail SegmentNet sales were  596 2 million at the Retail segment  down 2 8  mainly attributable to negative comparable store sales  comps  and soft sales due to store closures  somewhat offset

167938,389454,BBY,The S P 500 Hits More All Time Highs Floating On Pillows Of Caution,opinion,"AT40   47 5  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   55 3  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   9 8  volatility index Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary I should no longer be amazed  but I am still amazed  the inability of sellers to generate follow through in this market is quite profound 
At the end of last week  I characterized the Trump inspired one day sell off and the immediate rebound as indicative of   Within two more days  the entire loss on the S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   was reversed  In another two days  the S P 500 hit a new all time high  The index closed the week at a new all time high by less than one point 
The S P 500  SPY  left the nut jobs in the dust with new all time highs 
The recovery for the tech laden NASDAQ  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ    was just as sharp and immediate 
The NASDAQ  QQQ  also left the nut jobs in the dust with new all time highs 
The return to  normalcy  has come with the now familiar extremely low volatility  The volatility index  the VIX  is back to single digits and a near 14 year low 
The volatility index  the VIX  is back to single digits as a soothing calm descends once again 
I think it is safe to say that the minimum 5  pullback I anticipated for May is on hold  That guesstimation was based on   Now I assume that every time the VIX drops back into a period of extremely volatility  the clock resets  This latest reset pushes a 5   sell off out to August   I also need to consider a further refinement on the analysis  
Even as I look forward to a placid summer  I cannot help but watch out the corner of my eye the worsening divergence between the S P 500 and my favorite technical indicator  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   The S P 500  SPY  powered to fresh all time highs while leaving AT40 way behind  Before this week  the index last hit an all time high on May 15th  AT40 closed that day at 50 4   It closed today at 47 5  and looks completely stalled out already 
AT40  T2108  has again stalled out at surprisingly low levels given the S P 500 has hit fresh all time highs 
AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  looks worse  Not only is it trading below the May 15th level  but also it is still in the middle of a breakdown  Like AT40  AT200 declined on BOTH days the S P 500 made new all time highs 
AT200  T2107  is still in the middle of a breakdown despite the bullish price action form the major indices 
The combined behavior of these two indices require an interpretation caution  As I promised last week  I flipped the short term trading call to cautiously bullish after the S P 500 fully recovered from its 50DMA breakdown  I will keep the  cautious  qualifier until I see better behavior from AT40 and AT200 
One likely culprit weighing down on AT40 and AT200 is the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE   The downtrend on XLE has persisted all year  XLE has produced an amazingly straight and consistent 50DMA downtrend since February  On Thursday  oil prices plunged in the wake of the latest OPEC meeting and sent XLE tumbling anew even as the S P 500 made a new all time high  That 50DMA stood tall as resistance 

The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLE  once again confirmed its downtrending 50DMA as resistance 
Financials are also pushing the caution button  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  has yet to recover fully from last week s Trump Turmoil  and XLF could not fight through 50DMA resistance after four straight days of trying  The looming danger of a bearish breakdown from a head and shoulders  H S  pattern remains   The glass half full folks will rightly point out that a breakout above the right hand shoulder would be bullish  
The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  hangs in a precarious balance at the edge of a bearish head and shoulders breakdown and below 50DMA resistance 
Best Buy  NYSE BBY  is on the other side of caution  The stock market has spent weeks lamenting the relentless decline of retailers even as the outlook for the economy is as chipper as ever  Thursday morning delivered a bit of a wake up call with BBY earnings sparkling apparently thanks to gaming sales  The gap up  14   alone was impressive  BBY then proceeded to tack on another 4 more points  on its way to a new all time high and a whopping one day  post earnings gain of 21   Imagine THAT  an old school  big box retailer  selling a bunch of goods readily available on Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  at a new all time high 
This earnings season  I have typically bought early into such monster moves for a potential quick flip  This time  my old post earnings rule of fading BBY at the open took over  Only after two tranches of puts on a one point move and then a 3  point move form the open  did I realize I should have treated BBY as any other major gap up in the middle of an uptrend  Only Friday s 3 7  slide gives me any hope that this position may yet deliver profits before BBY resumes its momentum 
Best Buy  BBY  is suddenly a giant among retailing mice 
This post earnings performance has me wondering aloud about the potential surprises electronics retailer Conns Inc  NASDAQ CONN  might have in store when it reports earnings sometime in June  Can CONN benefit like BBY or did BBY vacuum up whatever non Amazon money is out there getting spent on electronics  CONN s powder keg could include vicious short covering as   Best Buy has  had    
Conn s Inc   CONN  has already more than doubled off its 2017 low  Can it keep up this sharp recovery from years of selling

167972,389488,BBY,OPEC Extends And Pretends,opinion,"Price action in equity markets was a little muted given that it was a public holiday in much of Europe  An upbeat tone following Federal Reserve meeting minutes was turned a little sour by OPEC  Shares on Spain s IBEX index were outperformers after the country s growth accelerated at the start of 2017 to make it Europe s fastest growing economy  US stocks opened higher  building on record highs made on Wednesday  Shares of Best Buy  NYSE BBY  soared double digits on sales boosted by the new Nintendo Switch console 


Oil traders reacted to a well telegraphed nine month extension to the current output cuts from OPEC by taking profits  The mini crash in oil prices this month forced OPEC to pre announce the plans so the announcement itself was a foregone conclusion  We said in our commentary May 15 that  An output extension has been widely expected so oil markets remain at risk of another crisis in confidence  
Tellingly  oil prices have not fully recovered the highs reached after the supply cuts were announced last November  The persistently high US oil production has added skepticism in the market that wasn t there at the last OPEC meeting  We see a better than 50 50 chance OPEC pre announces additional cuts before the next scheduled meeting in November 
FTSE weighed down by oil and gas
The FTSE 100 received a short lived shot in the arm from soft first quarter UK GDP data  which sent the pound lower  boosting the value of foreign company earnings  A downturn in the heavily weighted oil and gas shares following the OPEC announcement was the difference maker  The FTSE 350 oil and gas sector was at one point down by over 1  on the day  Shares of EasyJet  LON EZJ  took off for a seventh straight day of gains despite its half year loss widening thanks to a weaker pound 
Pounded by soft UK GDP
The British pound suffered another setback near the critical 1 30 level against the buck after final Q1 UK GDP data indicated a dramatic growth slowdown in the first quarter  The 0 2  expansion came short of previous estimates of 0 3   well down on the 0 7  in the fourth quarter of 2016  The slowest household spending in three years as well as a fall in exports were a significant drag  Some solace can be taken from signs of a seasonal effect whereby the first quarter has been poor for the last three years  We think any resulting softness in Sterling will be short lived as long as the politics trumps economics in the run up to the general election 
Dollar firms in wake of minutes
Federal Reserve minutes kept a June rate hike on the table but showed no rush to normalize the QE bloated balance sheet  Another rate hike beyond June was questioned by the suggestion it is  prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory   The dollar s outlook is clouded because it s still unclear if the Fed will halt rate increases as it unwinds the balance sheet ",2017-05-25,London Capital Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/opec-extends-and-pretends-200191474,200191474

168030,389546,BBY,Foot Locker  FL  Posted Negative Earnings Surprise In Q1,opinion,"Delay in income tax refunds broke the positive earnings surprise streak of Foot Locker  Inc    NYSE FL    This operator of athletic shoes and apparel retailer succumbed to a negative earnings surprise of 1 4  in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  after registering earnings beat in the preceding three quarters  The New York based company informed that the soft start witnessed in February was not fully offset by sturdy sales performance in March and April 
The company delivered quarterly earnings of  1 36 per share that fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and declined 2 2  year over year  Management in April had issued a cautious outlook and projected first quarter earnings to be equivalent to or marginally below last year s earnings or in the range of  1 36 to  1 39 per share 
Shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company are down roughly 8  during pre market trading hours  In the past three months  the stock has slipped 0 8  compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 14 7  

Total sales of  2 001 million were up 0 7  year over year but came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 022 million  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  total sales increased 1 8   Comparable store sales  comps  rose 0 5  during the quarter  High single digits comps growth registered in March and April failed to offset low double digit decline experienced in the month of February 
Nevertheless  management is working on all aspects to attain mid single digit earnings per share growth target for fiscal 2017 backed by effective implementation of operational and financial initiatives  We believe by continually capitalizing on opportunities like children s business  shop in shop expansion in collaboration with its vendors  store banner com business  store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments  Foot Locker is likely to benefit in the long run  International expansion  especially in Europe  is another growth catalyst  Further  the company is enhancing its eCommerce platform 
Gross margin contracted 100 basis points to 34  of sales  The selling  general and administrative expense rate rose 30 basis points to 18 5  during the quarter Foot Locker  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Other Financial Details
Foot Locker ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 049 million  long term debt and obligations under capital leases of  127 million  and shareholders  equity of  2 822 million

168032,389548,BBY,What s Up For Lions Gate Entertainment s  LGF  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp    producer and distributor of motion pictures for theatrical and straight to video release  is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 25  2017  after the closing bell   
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10 0   It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of last four quarters  with an average earnings beat of 213 3   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What to Expect 
The question lingering in the investors  minds now is whether Lions Gate Entertainment will be able to come up with a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 33 cents  reflecting a year over year increase of nearly 27  
We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable over the past 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks  expect revenues of  1 202 million compared with the  791 million reported in the prior year quarter 
The stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry and the S P 500 in the past six months  The company s shares have declined 46 2   compared with the Zacks categorized industry s fall of 4 7   However  the S P 500 has witnessed an increase of 8 2  
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Lions Gate s Television segment looks robust  In third quarter fiscal 2017  Television Production revenues jumped 39  to  229 million  driven mostly due to a rise in television deliveries  which includes episodes of Orange is the New Black  the new series Dear White People and the three hour musical event  Dirty Dancing 
However  the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize Lions Gate s margins  The persistence of this trend will leave no other option for the company but to depend more on lower revenue generating alternatives such as home video and television  which may not suffice to offset the production cost  Additionally  intensifying currency headwinds might weigh on its performance 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lions Gate is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Lions Gate has an Earnings ESP of  18 18  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 39 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 33 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Lions Gate carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

168033,389549,BBY,Can Dycom  DY  Keep Earnings Streak Alive In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Dycom Industries  Inc    NYSE DY   is slated to report fiscal third quarter 2017 results on May 24  before the opening bell 
In the last reported quarter  the company beat estimates  scoring a positive earnings surprise of 18 8   Encouragingly  the company has a stellar earnings surprise history with an average positive surprise of 17 3   beating estimates all through 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Of late  Dycom s profitability has soared on the back of increased demand for network bandwidth and mobile broadband  given the proliferation of smartphones  2016 witnessed massive investments for wireline networks  much higher than that in the 90 s  allowing customers to embark on multi year capital spending initiatives 
Significant deployment of wireline networks by major telecom companies   particularly 1 Gigabyte wireline networks   is expected to act as a major catalyst  propelling top line growth for the soon to be reported quarter  Rising capital expenditure by cable operators  who continue to deploy fiber in small and medium businesses  is also expected to boost profits 
In addition  Dycom s blue chip client list and healthy backlog levels add to its strength  The company has registered a healthy backlog level of  5 112 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter  of which approximately  2 363 billion is expected to be completed within the next 12 months  Also  a string of new contracts and renewal of old ones are likely to be conducive to the fiscal third quarter 2017 results 
Despite these strengths  the company s sales are susceptible to seasonal fluctuations and inclement weather conditions  as a large portion of its work is done outdoors   As a matter of fact  pronounced seasonal impact from businesses acquired by the company in 2015 has hurt earnings significantly in the past  Moreover  reduced activity levels and order flow in the recently acquired Goodman Networks pose as  major concerns 
Originally  Dycom had projected the buyout to generate about  150  165 million in revenues over the subsequent 12 months after closing the deal  Currently  it has lowered the revenue expectations from the recently acquired operations of Goodman Networks to about  10 million per quarter  This will likely stunt revenue growth for the upcoming quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dycom will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stand at  1 20  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Dycom Industries  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   Zacks Rank  Dycom has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of the ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

168034,389550,BBY,What s In Store For Deckers Outdoor  DECK  In Q4 Earnings  ,opinion,"Deckers Outdoor Corp    NYSE DECK    a leading designer  producer and brand manager of innovative  niche footwear and accessories  is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 25 
Previous quarter  the company had delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3 1   In the trailing four quarters  it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 24   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
What to Expect 
The question lingering in investors  minds now is whether Deckers Outdoor will be able to come up with a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 6 cents  In the year ago quarter  the company had posted earnings per share of 11 cents 
We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable over the past 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  359 million  down 5 3  from the year ago quarter 
We noted that the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the past six months  The company s shares have decreased 9 0   while the Zacks categorized industry has fallen 0 9    
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Deckers  focus on expanding its brand assortments  bringing more innovative line of products  targeting consumers digitally via marketing and a sturdy eCommerce as well as optimizing omni channel distribution bode well 
Deckers targets profitable and underpenetrated markets  along with focus on product innovations and store augmentation  Further  management is transitioning to a direct subsidiary model from a distributor model outside the U S  The company is also making substantial investments to fortify its online presence 
Management trimmed its fiscal 2017 outlook following a disappointing performance in the third quarter fiscal 2017  Deckers now expects net sales to decline 5  and projects earnings between  3 45 and  3 55 per share  The company had earlier forecast net sales to decline in the band of 1 5 3  and earnings in the range of  4 05  4 25 for fiscal 2017 
In the fourth quarter  net sales are estimated to decline by 5 6   Management envisions bottom line in the band of break even to a loss of  0 10 per share  compared to the adjusted earnings of  0 11 reported in the year ago period 
What the Zacks Model Unveils 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Deckers Outdoor is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Deckers Outdoor has an ESP of 0 00  as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are pegged at a loss of 6 cents  The company s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise

168057,389573,BBY,5 Quality Stock Picks Backed By DuPont Analysis,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  can be considered one of the most reliable metrics when investors set out to select quality stocks  That said  we would like to note that the basic ROE calculation doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get misled by picking stocks based on this number  
Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 10 stocks that made it through the screen 
Nutrisystem Inc    NASDAQ NTRI    This Zacks Rank  1 company is a provider of weight management products and services  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26   You can see  
Ulta Beauty Inc    NASDAQ ULTA    It is a beauty retailer primarily in the U S  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 31

168058,389574,BBY,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Papa Murphy s Holdings  Platform Specialty Products  Five9  Best Buy And Sonus Networks,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 18  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Papa Murphy s Holdings Inc   NASDAQ         Platform Specialty Products Corporation  NYSE         Five9 Inc   NASDAQ         Best Buy Co  NYSE BBY   Inc   NYSE        and Sonus Networks Inc   NASDAQ        

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

On the Lookout for Earnings Beats  5 Top Picks

	We are at the tail end of the Q1 earnings season  with over 89  of the S P 500 constituents having reported already  The season has so far been fairly solid  Investors should note that along with the brightening earnings growth picture  beat ratios are also slowly scaling higher 

	So far  about 72 4  of the companies beat EPS estimates  as per the  issued on May 10  We have seen a  earnings beat ratio  delivered by over 82  companies in the S P 500 cohort  in the preceding earnings season  This strong earnings beat trend should cheer investors up 

Inside Earnings Surprise 

	Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 

	Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 

	On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 

	Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 

How to Find Likely Outperformers  

	Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 

	An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 

Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20    We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  

Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20    This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 

  greater than zero   A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 

	In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 

Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10    Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 

Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000   High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	A handful of criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around eight 

	Here are five out of the eight stocks that passed the screen 

Papa Murphy s Holdings Inc   NASDAQ        This Zacks Rank  2 company operates as a franchisor and operator of the Take  N  Bake pizza chain in the U S  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 35  

Platform Specialty Products Corporation   NYSE        This company produces high technology specialty chemical products  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 34   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Play Potential Earnings Beats with These 5 Top Ranked Stocks 

	It is a common practice to scan stocks that can beat market expectation ahead of an earnings release  This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high quality in nature 

Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 

	Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 

	Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 

	On the other hand  after much brainstorming  analyzing companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when coming to an earnings estimate 

	Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise drives the market post release 

How to Find Those Potential Outperformers 

	Now  finding out stocks that have the possibility to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 

	A dependable track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 

Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20    We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  

Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20    This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 

  greater than zero   A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 

	In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 

Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10    Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 

Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000   High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around 7 

	Here are five out of the seven stocks 

Sonus Networks Inc    NASDAQ        This company is a provider of voice infrastructure products for the new public network  Sonus has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 36   at the time of writing 

CNH Industrial N V    NYSE        This Zacks Rank  2 company designs  produces and sells trucks  commercial vehicles  buses and special vehicles  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 36  

WellCare Health Plans Inc    NYSE        This is a provider of managed care services targeted exclusively at government sponsored healthcare programs  focusing on Medicaid and Medicare  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 39   The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see     

Exelixis Inc    NASDAQ        This is a biopharmaceutical company sporting a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 38  

Best Buy Co  Inc    NYSE        This leading retailer carries a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 19

168155,389671,BBY,Can Herbalife  HLF  Spring A Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Herbalife Ltd    NYSE HLF   is set to report first quarter 2017 results on May 4  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether the marketing company will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to be reported quarter  We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the each of the trailing four quarters  with an average of 14 5   In fact  the company has posted positive surprise in the past nine straight quarters 
Coming to the share price movement  the stock not only outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry but also the broader Retail sector on a year to date basis  Herbalife s shares rallied 30 7  year to date  higher than the Zacks categorized Retail Drug Stores industry s growth of 1 2  and sector s growth of 11 3  year to date 
The industry is part of the bottom 17  of the Zacks Classified industries  219 out of the 265   On the contrary  the broader sector is placed at the bottom most of the Zacks Classified sectors  16 out of 16   This shows that the company has been performing better than the industry as well as the sector 

Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way Are Estimates Trending 
Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained unchanged over the past 30 days and is currently pegged at 87 cents  down 36  from  1 36 delivered in the year ago quarter 
What the Zacks Model Unveils 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Herbalife is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Herbalife has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 87 cents  Herbalife has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP for an earnings beat Herbalife LTD  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors Influencing the Quarter
We note that this weight management and nutritional products company is witnessing volume improvement in key markets including Europe  the Middle East and Africa  primarily impacted by its marketing plan changes  which were implemented in Feb 2015  In fact  the company is seeing sequential improvements in key metrics in these markets and remains encouraged by the positive trends 
However  total sales declined in the fourth quarter  after posting three consecutive quarters of growth in revenues  due to currency headwinds and lower overall volumes  Further  the company lowered its full year 2017 earnings and revenue guidance due to sluggish fourth quarter results  Unfavorable currency  which is a major headwind for the company  continues to hurt earnings in the quarter to be reported 
Herbalife expects sales to fall in the range of 5  to 9  due to a decline in volume of 1  to 5  in the first quarter  On a currency adjusted basis  excludes the impact of expenses relating to challenges to the company s business model  the impact of non cash interest costs associated with the company s convertible notes  FTC settlement implementation and expenses related to regulatory inquiries   sales are expected to decline 3 2  to 7 2  
For first quarter 2017  the company expects adjusted earnings per share to grow in the range of 75 cents to 95 cents per share  which includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 10 cents per share  Excluding the currency impact  adjusted earnings are expected in a range of 85 cents to  1 05 per share 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the broader retail sector carrying both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  and therefore worth considering include 
Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   has an Earnings ESP of  12 5  and sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
Jack In The Box Inc    NASDAQ JACK   has an Earnings ESP of  4 4  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 
L Brands Inc    NYSE LB   has an Earnings ESP of  4 2  and carries a Zacks Rank  3

168174,389690,BBY,5 Solid Stocks To Buy On The Second Straight Retail Dip ,opinion,U S  retail sales fell for a second straight month in March  highlighting the extent of loss in terms of economic growth in the first quarter  Total sales at nationwide retailers dropped primarily because of cheaper gas and a drop in receipts at auto dealerships However  if autos and gas are excluded  retail sales seem to have risen substantially  Electronic stores had a particularly strong month as did clothing stores  Also  Internet retailers witnessed a healthy increase in sales  Lest we forget  high consumer confidence and steady rise in wages will certainly drive retail sales going forward  Hence  investing in retail segments that have showed considerable strength won t be a bad proposition Inside the Retail ReportSales at U S retailers fell for the second straight month in March  mostly due to weaker gasoline and auto sales  Overall sales declined 0 2   matching the consensus estimate of the Commerce Department  Last month  sales at gasoline stations fell 1  because of lower prices  while auto dealers  revenues were down 1 2   Sales at some other categories were also weak  Sales at furniture stores  sporting good outlets  and restaurants and bars declined 0 3   0 8  and 0 6   respectively The apparent slowdown is also partly blamed on the slower than usual issuance of tax refunds by the government  At the same time  economists have said that snowstorms in the Midwest and Northeast could have kept shoppers at home  thereby  affecting sales  However  what made the decline even worse was a government update to sales figure for February  reflecting a drop of 0 3  in contrast to the 0 1  increase reported at first Core Retail Sales Edge UpNevertheless  a core measure that excludes volatile items saw solid growth in March  Core retail sales that exclude volatile items like autos  gasoline  food services and building materials increased 0 5   A 2 6  uptick at electronics and appliance stores  1  at clothing shops and 0 3  at general merchandise stores helped offset declines  U S  retailers  particularly from segments such as home and garden centers and drug stores  have also done reasonably well The latest retail sales figures underscore consumers  ongoing shift from traditional brick and motor retailers to e commerce platforms  Nonstore retailers that generally constitute online shopping at outlets such as Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   registered a gain of 0 6  from the prior month and a 11 9  increase from a year earlier Future Trends Hold PromiseNot only did retailers fare well for the most part  economists expect sales to accelerate soon in the light of higher consumer confidence and a steady rise in wages  U S  consumer confidence leaped in March to the highest level since Dec 2000 amid growing labor market optimism  As per the Conference Board  the consumer confidence index jumped to 125 6 in March from 116 1 in February  surpassing the consensus expectation of 113  Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been  historically  good at predicting future consumer spending for the next three to six months Additionally  about 27 1  of consumers expect better business conditions in the next six months  the highest since Dec 2003  while 21 5  anticipate a rise in income over the same time frame  again the highest since 2006  Consumers also feel optimistic about the jobs market  Share of those saying that jobs are  plentiful  increased from 26 9  to 31 7   Meanwhile  hourly earnings for an average American worker inched up 0 2  to  26 14 an hour in March  as per the Labor Department Play Smart with These 5 RetailersThe soft sales have largely been concentrated among auto dealers and gas stations  However  investing in the abovementioned segments that have gained will be prudent  After all  the projections for consumer spending levels look bright  which will further boost sales at such segments  We have  thus  selected five solid retail stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Best Buy Co Inc   NYSE BBY   is a provider of technology

	The apparent slowdown is also partly blamed on the slower than usual issuance of tax refunds by the government  At the same time  economists have said that snowstorms in the Midwest and Northeast could have kept shoppers at home  thereby  affecting sales  However  what made the decline even worse was a government update to sales figure for February  reflecting a drop of 0 3  in contrast to the 0 1  increase reported at first 

Core Retail Sales Edge Up

	Nevertheless  a core measure that excludes volatile items saw solid growth in March  Core retail sales that exclude volatile items like autos  gasoline  food services and building materials increased 0 5   A 2 6  uptick at electronics and appliance stores  1  at clothing shops and 0 3  at general merchandise stores helped offset declines  U S  retailers  particularly from segments such as home and garden centers and drug stores  have also done reasonably well 

	The latest retail sales figures underscore consumers  ongoing shift from traditional brick and motor retailers to e commerce platforms  Nonstore retailers that generally constitute online shopping at outlets such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  registered a gain of 0 6  from the prior month and a 11 9  increase from a year earlier 

Future Trends Hold Promise

	Not only did retailers fare well for the most part  economists expect sales to accelerate soon in the light of higher consumer confidence and a steady rise in wages  U S  consumer confidence leaped in March to the highest level since Dec 2000 amid growing labor market optimism  As per the Conference Board  the consumer confidence index jumped to 125 6 in March from 116 1 in February  surpassing the consensus expectation of 113  Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been  historically  good at predicting future consumer spending for the next three to six months 

	Additionally  about 27 1  of consumers expect better business conditions in the next six months  the highest since Dec 2003  while 21 5  anticipate a rise in income over the same time frame  again the highest since 2006  Consumers also feel optimistic about the jobs market  Share of those saying that jobs are  plentiful  increased from 26 9  to 31 7   Meanwhile  hourly earnings for an average American worker inched up 0 2  to  26 14 an hour in March  as per the Labor Department

168177,389693,BBY,2 ETFs   Stocks To Cheer Up Despite Gloomy March Retail Sales,opinion,"After a strong start to 2017  U S  retail sales nosedived for the second month in a row in March  Sales dropped 0 2  sequentially in March  following a downwardly revised 0 3  decline in February  Previously  a 0 1  increase was reported in February sales  March data marked the first successive two month drop in over two years  as per   Economists expected March numbers to slide only 0 1  
Reduced buying of motor vehicles  1 2   and expenditure in gas stations  down 1   were behind this slide  Basically  a sharp drop in crude prices last month weighed on retail sales and inflation  Six out of the 13 key categories registered a drop in sales  Building material outlets  sporting goods  furniture stores  and food and drinking places also saw a decline in purchases 
However  electronics and appliances stores  2 6    food and beverage stores  0 5    health and personal care stores  0 1    clothing and clothing accessories  1   and general merchandise stores  0 3   recorded gains 
Analysts attributed this downside to the delayed disbursement of a tax refund by the government  Weather glitches in March like Winter Storm Stella that hit Northeast U S  may also have hurt some portion of sales  read    
Overall  this scenario triggers concerns over the GDP reading of Q1  especially since the U S  economy generates a considerable portion of the GDP from consumer spending  The Atlanta Fed already slashed its first quarter GDP estimate by one tenth of a percentage point to 0 5    which would be the weakest performance in three years   as per Reuters 
Are There Any Silver Lining 
Despite the unimpressive headline numbers  there are some segments that can prove to be hidden gems  Electronics and appliances store sales registered their largest jump since June 2015  according to  read    
Purchases at clothing stores jumped the most in a year   a nice surprise when brick and mortar retailing is grappling with declining footfall and rising competition from online stores  Notably  several brick and mortar retailers have been resorting to store closures lately  read

168202,389718,BBY,Snap s Tailspin Will Worsen Into Earnings,opinion,"Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP   Information Technology   Internet Software   Services   Estimated Report Data April 25  After Market Closes 
Key Takeaways
Analysts at Estimize expect 57  decline on the bottom line to negative 17 cent per share on  193 25 million in revenue  roughly  395  higher than the same period last year 
Snap opened for public trading nearly two weeks ago with polarizing expectations about the near term future  Many market commentators predicted the stock would fall flat due to weak underlying fundamentals but that didn t stop millennials from grabbing a piece of the action 
At the outset  shares nearly touched  30 on a rich  40 billion valuation  making it more expensive than popular brands like Twitter  NYSE TWTR   Hilton  NYSE HLT  and Best Buy  NYSE BBY   But its post IPO twinkle lost its shine in a mere 2 days as much of the initial excitement started to fade  Snap now trades nearly  4 below its  24 debut price with new Wall Street analysts emerging each day to issue disparaging sell ratings  The most troubling trends analysts take exception with concentrate on Snap s unclear path to profitability  questionable ability to draw in new ad revenue and decelerating user growth  
Although Snap calls itself a camera company  its core business still revolves around the 150 million daily active users sending messages that automatically disappear in a matter of seconds  In order to move higher  Snap must focus on driving users  which inevitably pulls ad dollars     not selling sunglasses that liken it to beleaguered camera maker GoPro  NASDAQ GPRO  
Some fear that Snap already reached a critical mass of core users and doesn t hold the same appeal with middle aged or retired audiences    one of the biggest differences between Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Snap  The Zuckerberg led network effectively provides users a platform to reconnect and catch up with past friends whereas Snap s target audience doesn t extend beyond millennials  Meanwhile  the launch of Instagram Stories  a near replica of SnapChat  puts Snap at risk of losing some of its established user base 
In any case  the  camera company  faces an uphill battle that will only worsen if quarterly results miss analyst s targets  Initial estimates on Estimize forecast steepening losses and decelerating revenue growth  Analysts expect earnings to drop 57  to 17 cents per share on a 395  increase in revenue to  193 26 million  On the surface  projected revenue growth may be reassuring but compared to previous quarters when Snap was private  it reflects a slight slowdown

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Rely on DuPont  NYSE DD  for 5 Healthy Top Ranked Stocks

	Return on equity  ROE  is one of the most favored metrics of investors  It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity  Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock 

	However  stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns  Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play It is an analytical method  which examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 

	ROE   Net Income Equity
	Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
	ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier

Why Use DuPont 

	Although one cannot brush off the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always portray a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies with higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 

	And one of the ROE components   equity multiplier  explained below    can help you judge how burdened a company is with debts  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 

	So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 

	Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at a company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 

Screening Parameters
	  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE 
	  Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales 
	  Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets 
	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment 
	  Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed 
	Here are five of the eight stocks that made it through the screen 

Nutrisystem Inc    NASDAQ        This Zacks Rank  1 company is a provider of weight management products and services  Though its Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 36   its Sector Rank is in the top 50   You can see

168288,389804,BBY,Best Buy And 4 Other Retail Stocks For The Holiday Season,opinion,"The  Trump Factor  may have been ruling the U S  stock market but it is the attractive holiday season deals that are ruling the hearts of customers  A blockbuster Thanksgiving weekend and buoyant Cyber Monday indicate that the season is turning out to be a bonanza for retailers  who are cashing in on customers preferring to shop from the comfort of their homes  mostly online or through their mobile phones 
Thanksgiving and Black Friday online sales touched a new record this year  surging 17 7  to  5 27 billion  per Adobe  Bargain hunters bought  3 34 billion worth of products online on Black Friday  an increase of 21 6  from last year  thus setting a new record  The euphoria did not end here  as the shopping frenzy was palpable on Cyber Monday when online sales jumped 12 1  to  3 45 billion 
On the flip side  increased online shopping resulted in lower footfall at stores  According to RetailNext  sales at brick and mortar stores on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday declined 5   while the number of transactions dropped 7 9  
Traditionally  retail stocks get a push during the holiday season  which is a make or break time for retailers  Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits  retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall

Retail Sector Holds Promise
Post Brexit  the U S  economy looks quite steady and this holds good for the holiday season  The second estimate for GDP shows that the U S  economy grew 3 2  in the third quarter  faring better than the first estimate of 2 9  growth and the second quarter anemic increase of 1 4   Given the rebounding economy  still lower gasoline prices and improving labor market  the retail space is brimming with optimism 
These factors have boosted buyers  confidence  which improved significantly in November  reaching its highest level in nine years  We expect this positive sentiment to propel consumer spending  Consumer spending increased 2 8  during the third quarter  The Commerce Department recently unveiled that consumer spending advanced 0 3  in October   Read   
Given the ability and willingness among consumers to spend more  retailers could hear their cash registers jingle this time  Data compiled by eMarketer suggests a 3 3  jump in holiday sales  November and December  to  884 5 billion  Retail e commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to increase 17 2   and represent approximately 10 7  of total sales this season  or  94 71 billion     
Data compiled by the nation s largest retail trade group  National Retail Federation  project a 3 6  rise in November and December sales  excluding autos  gas and restaurant sales  to  655 8 billion  which is far better than the 10 year average sales growth of 2 5   Non store sales for the season are expected to increase 7 10  to approximately  117 billion 
Why Best Buy 
With the advent of the holiday season  the retail sector takes the center stage  So  how about betting your bucks on lucrative options  Best Buy  a retailer of technology products  services  and solutions  is one such stock  which investors can count on  The stock has been on a bull ride in the index and has surged approximately 54  so far in the year  comfortably outperforming the Zacks categorized Retail Wholesale sector that showed marginal growth of 3 6

168289,389805,BBY,Conns   CONN  Q3 Loss Narrower Than Expected  Stock Up,opinion,Shares of Conn s  Inc    NASDAQ CONN   rose nearly 8 9  after the company posted narrower than expected loss for third quarter fiscal 2017  Also  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has surged 35 7  in the past six months and outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail Consumer Electronics industry growth of 31 1  The company recorded adjusted loss of 8 cents per share in the quarter  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents  However  in the year ago quarter  the company had reported adjusted earnings of 2 cents per share Including one time items  the company posted a loss of 12 cents per share  against earnings of 7 cents in the year ago quarter  Total revenue fell 4 7  year over year to  376 8 million and also came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  392 8 million  Further  the refinements made to the underwriting model impacted fiscal third quarter comparable store sales  comps  by nearly 1000 basis points  bps  Segment DiscussionConns offers consumer durable products in the U S  under the Retail segment  including home appliances  furniture and mattresses  home office as well as consumer electronics  During the fiscal third quarter  the company witnessed a year over year sales decline across Furniture and mattress  along with Home appliance  Home office  Consumer Electronics and Other segments The Retail segment s total revenue decreased 4 5  to  308 4 million  mainly due to lower comps  partly offset by the introduction of new stores  Also  sales were adversely affected by underwriting changes made in fourth quarter fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017  Comps for the reported quarter declined 10 1   Excluding adjustment for the recent underwriting refinements  it edged down 0 1  Further  gross margin at the Retail segment expanded 40 bps  both on a year over year and sequential basis  to 37 5   The rise was attributable to higher warehouse and delivery charges  along with improved product assortments Moreover  adjusted operating profit at the Retail segment came in at  35 9 million  down 6 8  year over year  on excluding the net charges of  2 0 million  mainly related to impairments from disposals  legal and professional fees  In addition  operating margin contracted 20 bps to 11 7  Revenues from the company s Credit segment fell 5 2  to  68 4 million in the quarter  This was due to declining credit insurance commissions and lower average rates  along with an 80 bps contraction in the yield rate to 15 0   partially mitigated by average balance growth of 3 9  in the customer receivable portfolio  At quarter end  total customer portfolio balance improved 2 2  year over year to  1 5 billion During the fiscal third quarter  the company s provision for bad debts decreased by  6 8 million to  51 3 million  This was led by a marginal improvement noted in the allowance for bad debt  attributable to sluggish portfolio growth and underwriting refinements  partly compensated by higher net charge offs  Additionally  the provision for bad debts gained from improved performance of the portfolio  which fell 11 4  year over year  This  in turn  highlights the first provision reduction in the last four quarters  on a yearly basis  Consequently  as a percentage of the average portfolio balance  the fiscal third quarter provision came in at 13 3   versus 15 6  delivered in the year ago quarter Moreover  slower portfolio growth  along with the shift in long term no interest programs to Synchrony  hurt the 60 day delinquency rate in the reported quarter  At the end of the fiscal third quarter  the 60 day delinquency rate  after adjusting these items  came in at 10 9  of the total outstanding loan balance Liquidity PositionAs of Oct 31  2016  the company had cash and cash equivalents of nearly  59 1 million  long term debt and capital lease obligations of  1 259 0 million  and total shareholders  equity of approximately  516 7 million Borrowings outstanding under Conns  revolving credit facility of  810 million  as of Oct 31  2016  were  146 0 million  The company also had  59 1 million free cash available for use Store UpdateDuring the reported quarter  Conns introduced one new Conn s HomePlus store in North Carolina  raising the company s total store count to 113  With this  the company has opened 10 new stores in fiscal 2017 and plans to open no additional stores in the rest of the fiscal year Going forward  Conns expects to open three stores in fiscal 2018 Other DevelopmentsConns  has been witnessing improvements from its credit business as evident from its fiscal third quarter notable reductions in initial stage delinquency and first pay defaults  Further  it completed the implementation of its Texas direct loan program before the scheduled time  Notably  it started its operation across all 55 Texas locations by October end  Consequently  it improved APR more than 27   increasing over 500 bps  as compared with the month of September  Going forward  management expects the loan program to produce nearly 600 900 bps   Also  Conns disposed the 2016 A Class C Notes at a premium and completed its third ABS transaction since Sep 2015  during October Meanwhile  the company s retail business has been performing well amid the tough retail environment and remains on track to improve the performance of its credit business and thus overall profitability  Also  its turn around strategic initiatives are likely to impact the company s financial results  going forward GuidanceFor fourth quarter fiscal 2017  the company expects comps to decrease nearly 10 0   For November  its comps declined nearly 8  due to the underwriting refinements Further  retail gross margin is anticipated between 37 0 37 5   and selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  in the range of 27 75 28 75  Conns also projects the provision for bad debts to

The company is exposed to intense competition on all fronts  from dollar stores to traditional grocery store chains and online business  Its international operations are also under pressure with a stronger dollar eating into sales 
Wal Mart continues to invest in its e commerce business to compete with online retailer Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    Hence  it expects to incur huge e commerce expenses over the near term  given the shipping costs and price competition involved in it 
Wal Mart has also pledged to invest  2 7 billion on raising employees  wages and giving them extra training in fiscal 2017  Under the initiative  the company had increased its minimum wage to  9 an hour in Apr 2015  and to  10 per hour in Feb 2016  The initiative of paying higher wages is expected to help reduce turnover and increase retention 
The company will also improve its customer service and this should ultimately encourage shoppers to spend more  However  it will further raise the expense burden on the retailer  Higher labor costs  along with the company s efforts to overhaul its stores and invest in its online operations  will weigh on earnings 
The industry wide weakness in the grocery supermarket business is impacting Wal Mart s operations  The industry is grappling with food deflation  stiff competition  aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic  These headwinds have largely impacted major food grocers like Wal Mart  The Kroger  NYSE KR  Co   Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM   Inc   SuperValu  and Sprouts Farmers Market 
Optimism Regarding the Stock
Despite prevailing headwinds  it is encouraging to note that the company is making efforts to understand the evolving needs of its customers to regain their confidence  and thus boost sales 
Wal Mart continues to impress investors with positive comps at Wal Mart U S  for nine successive quarters  buoyed by a 0 7  increase in traffic  Moreover  traffic improved for the eighth consecutive quarter  owing to the company s efforts to modernize its stores for higher footfall  Traffic also increased due to an improvement in consumer spending 
Bentonville  AR based Wal Mart also aims to expand its online business through acquisitions  Recently  the company acquired U S  based e commerce company  Jet com  Inc  and is also in talks to invest in India s largest e commerce firm  Flipkart Online Services Pvt  in order to expand in the fast growing online retail market and grab market share in the country 
Apart from acquisitions  Wal Mart has also launched its own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay  This allows shoppers to pay through its existing smartphone app  Wal Mart is also aggressively trying to get a share of online grocery delivery  a booming industry 
We expect the aforementioned factors to help this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times  Hence  we suggest investors to hold on to the stock as the rest is a wait and watch story

168291,389807,BBY,5 Value Stocks That Still Have P E Below 15,opinion,"Post election of Donald Trump as President elect  the financial markets are steadily rising  This is evident from the Dow Jones Industrial Average which has touched new highs 13 times in the last 22 trading sessions  Similarly the bullish trend is echoed by the S P 500 which has done the same 9 times However  going forward the markets may come to a crossroads  Our apprehension comes from the uncertainty regarding the outcome of a slew of events including the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed  a stronger dollar  steady inclusion of generals in the Trump cabinet and the stance of healthcare insurance companies over the Affordable Care Act  or ACA  are expected to spark bouts of volatility  Added to these  growing discontent in Italy against the European Union which is showing early signs of another Brexit and we all know why investors are edgy Amid this uncertainty  it will be a prudent decision to stay invested in fundamentally sound companies that are unperturbed by market gyrations  If such companies are undervalued  it s even better  since they will gain in strength once the broader markets move north Fed Rate Hike Investors remain concerned about the decision to be taken by the Fed on rate hike next week  as the latest polls suggest chances of a rate hike this month is considerable  It is the optimism stemming from November s jobs report that increased the rate hike possibility  The U S  economy added 178 000 jobs in November  mainly from professional  business services and in health care  according to the Labor department 
The jobless rate fell to 4 6  last month  but the drop was mostly due to declining labor force participation  This is due to the fact that a higher number of people were actively not looking for employment and were therefore not counted as unemployed  Now  this isn t a promising sign and is bound to have repercussions on consumer confidence  This might even hamper spending levels that have been one of the bright spots driving the economy An All General Trump Cabinet The way things are moving in Capitol Hill  it may not be too farfetched to think of an all general cabinet under Trump  After army general Michael Flynn as White House national security adviser and Marine general James Mattis as defense secretary nominee  comes the news of the selection of Marine general John F  Kelly as Secretary of Homeland Security  Also in the reckoning are army general David H  Petraeus for Secretary of State and Navy Admiral Michael S  Rogers for Director of National Intelligence  Investor apprehension was aptly expressed by Senator Chris Murphy who said    when we view problems in the world through a military lens  we make big mistakes  Beginning of the End for Affordable Care ActA number of times during his presidential campaign  Donald Trump labeled Affordable Care Act  ACA  as a disaster which requires immediate  less expensive replacement  According to him  Obamacare is replete with special interest handouts  budget gimmicks and tax increases  all leading to higher premiums and deductibles with reduced access to care 
In particular  he talked about the adversities of the Medicaid expansion plan and the two highly controversial taxes   the  Cadillac plan  and the temporarily repealed medical device tax  Given the writing on the wall  the healthcare insurance industry is resigned to the demise of the Affordable Care Act and is closely watching developments on Capitol Hill So  if you are set to maneuver in such an uncertain market and unleash the potential of your portfolio  all you need to do is    play your stocks right How to Make the Right MovesIn value investing  investors select stocks that are trading lower than their fair value or intrinsic value and thus offer a significant upside potential  However  not all cheap stocks can ensure high returns over the long haul With the market at the crossroads  it is essential for investors to be watchful of what they are paying for  Hence  investing in low price earnings   P E   stocks can prove to be good bargains as the P E ratio is a snapshot of a firm s earnings strength  A low P E indicates that either a stock s price has declined or that its earnings performance has been improving We have taken the help of the  to easily pick the winning stocks  In order to screen out potential value stocks  we have considered only those that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and a value score of  A   You can see  
Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  These stocks also have a lower forward P E ratio and favorable growth potential  Moreover  as they currently trade at a Price Earnings  F1  ratio of less than 15  there is further room to run 5 Value BetsOcean Rig UDW LLC   NASDAQ ORIG  With a Zacks Rank  1  Nicosia  Cyprus headquartered Ocean Rig mainly provides services related to offshore drilling to the upstream energy players  The company s drilling units specialize in operating in harsh environment  The company is currently trading at a forward P E multiple of 0 44  which compares favorably with the industry average of  1 90 

Seagate Technology plc   NASDAQ STX  Headquartered at Dublin  Ireland  Seagate is the second largest manufacturer of hard disk drives  HDDs  in the U S  It also develops other electronic data storage products such as SSD  solid state drive  and solid state hybrid drives  SSHD   This Zacks Rank  1 stock is currently trading at a forward P E multiple of 10 43 and saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings surging almost 25  over the last 60 days 
The Liberty Media Group   NASDAQ LMCA  Englewood  CO based Liberty Media owns interests in a broad range of businesses  including media  communications and entertainment  The company offers its services predominantly in the North American region  The Zacks Rank  1 stock is currently trading at a forward P E multiple of 10 70  which compares favorably with the industry average of 17 30 

Best Buy Co  Inc    NYSE BBY  Incorporated in 1966 and headquartered in Richfield  MN  Best Buy Company Inc  is a multinational specialty retailer  It deals in consumer electronics  home office products  entertainment software  appliances and related services through around 1 500 domestic locations and 300 international outlets  The company is currently trading at a forward P E multiple of 14 35 and saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings rising almost 7 6  over the last 30 days 

General Motors Company   NYSE GM  Detroit  MI based General Motors Company produces  sells and services cars  trucks and parts under four core brands   Chevrolet  Buick  GMC and Cadillac  GM assembles passenger cars  crossover vehicles  light trucks  sport utility vehicles  SUVs   vans and other vehicles  The company is currently trading at a forward P E multiple of 5 83 and saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings rising almost 3 3  over the last 30 days 

End NoteThe strong fundamentals of these aforementioned picks blended with bullish analyst interest could just have unveiled stocks that might rally harder in the months to come   Hence  by simply playing it smart  one can emerge as a winner even in a market as erratic as this

5 Stocks to Buy on Notable Relative Price Strength

	Investors generally gauge a stock s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark 

	If you see that a stock is underperforming on the fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns 

	Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of one to three months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

	Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains 

Screening Parameters

Relative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   1 week greater than 0

	 We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S P 500 over the last 12 weeks  4 weeks and 1 week

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Forget Earnings Growth  Focus on Beat with These 5 Stocks

	Gone are the days when investors were satisfied simply with just earnings growth  Now  earnings improvement  no matter how big it is  seems inadequate for solid moves in the market  It is the  BEAT  that matters the most 

What is Earnings Beat 

	A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 

	This is because investors always try to take positions ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with a stellar performance  Now  since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much deliberation  their estimates act as investment leads 

Why to Give Earnings Beat So Much of Precedence 

	After all  only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company s strength when an industry wide earnings recession is felt 

	Also  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent a decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 

	Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 

	On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception 

How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 

	Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s consistency in surpassing estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 

Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks that delivered a positive surprise in the last quarter are likely to surprise again 

Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  

Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 

Zacks Rank less than equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see     

   greater than zero    A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 

	In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 

Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 

Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000    High trading volume implies that the stock has adequate liquidity 

	A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 18 

	Here are five out of the 18 stocks 

The Chemours Company   NYSE      This Zacks Rank  1company is engaged in chemical business  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 33  

Matador Resources Company    NYSE      This Zacks Rank  2 energy company is engaged in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas resources  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 28

168398,389914,BBY,6 Stocks To Benefit From Rising Inflation Expectations,opinion,"The U S  dollar has been surging against major currencies throughout the globe since Donald Trump emerged victorious in the Presidential election  Rising expectations of a pickup in inflation rate on the back of Trump s pledge to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes emerged as the main reasons behind the surge in the greenback  This also led to a massive increase in yields on the U S Treasury bonds 
In this backdrop  picking stocks from sectors that are likely to benefit from an increase in inflation rate may prove to be a wise decision 
Trump Presidency Expected to Boost Inflation
Most of the analysts expect that Trump s presidency may help the U S  economy to overcome year long low inflation environment and expand at an impressive pace in the days ahead  During his election campaign  Trump repeatedly emphasized on building infrastructure throughout the U S 
Even in his victory speech  Trump said that he will give precedence in rebuilding infrastructure   which will become  by the way  second to none   He had also promised earlier an increase in public spending on infrastructure by a trillion of dollars over the next 10 years  In fact  he is expected to offer  137 billion in tax credits to private construction companies undertaking infrastructure projects 
Trump vowed to cut U S  corporate tax rates to 15  from 35   which will likely increase the attractiveness of the U S  as a business destination  The Republican candidate also vowed to cut taxes for all Americans  reducing the top tax bracket from 39 6  to 33   This move could bolster consumer spending  fueling growth in the economy  Investors are betting that these factors are likely to play a vital role in increasing inflation in the days ahead 
Fisher Signals Rise in Inflation
Separately  recent comments from the Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer also indicated that the central bank has started to believe that inflation rate in the U S  is on the verge of a significant pickup  In a conference at the Central Bank of Chile  Fisher said   In my view  the Fed appears reasonably close to achieving both the inflation and employment components of its mandate   He also signaled that this may lead to further policy tightening in the near future  He said   Accordingly  the case for removing accommodation gradually is quite strong  keeping in mind that the future is uncertain and that monetary policy is not on a preset course  
Earlier on Monday  rising inflation expectations led the greenback to strengthen significantly against major currencies to touch a nine month high level  The dollar index that measures the value of the U S  dollar against six major currencies shot up 0 4  to 99 471 
Moreover  since Trump s win the U S  Treasury bonds have been witnessing massive sell offs  which in turn is leading yields on the same to rise to record levels  The 30 year US Treasuries yield jumped 7 83 basis points to cross the 3  mark for the first time this year on Monday

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

Stocks to Benefit from Rising Inflation Expectations

	The U S  dollar has been surging against major currencies throughout the globe since Donald Trump emerged victorious in the Presidential election  Rising expectations of a pickup in inflation rate on the back of Trump s pledge to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes emerged as the main reasons behind the surge in the greenback  This also led to a massive increase in yields on the U S Treasury bonds 

	In this backdrop  picking stocks from sectors that are likely to benefit from an increase in inflation rate may prove to be a wise decision 

Trump Presidency Expected to Boost Inflation

	Most of the analysts expect that Trump s presidency may help the U S  economy to overcome year long low inflation environment and expand at an impressive pace in the days ahead  During his election campaign  Trump repeatedly emphasized on building infrastructure throughout the U S 

	Even in his victory speech  Trump said that he will give precedence in rebuilding infrastructure   which will become  by the way  second to none   He had also promised earlier an increase in public spending on infrastructure by a trillion of dollars over the next 10 years  In fact  he is expected to offer  137 billion in tax credits to private construction companies undertaking infrastructure projects 

	Trump vowed to cut U S  corporate tax rates to 15  from 35   which will likely increase the attractiveness of the U S  as a business destination  The Republican candidate also vowed to cut taxes for all Americans  reducing the top tax bracket from 39 6  to 33   This move could bolster consumer spending  fueling growth in the economy  Investors are betting that these factors are likely to play a vital role in increasing inflation in the days ahead 

Fisher Signals Rise in Inflation

	Separately  recent comments from the Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer also indicated that the central bank has started to believe that inflation rate in the U S  is on the verge of a significant pickup  In a conference at the Central Bank of Chile  Fisher said   In my view  the Fed appears reasonably close to achieving both the inflation and employment components of its mandate   He also signaled that this may lead to further policy tightening in the near future  He said   Accordingly  the case for removing accommodation gradually is quite strong  keeping in mind that the future is uncertain and that monetary policy is not on a preset course  

	Earlier on Monday  rising inflation expectations led the greenback to strengthen significantly against major currencies to touch a nine month high level  The dollar index that measures the value of the U S  dollar against six major currencies shot up 0 4  to 99 471 

	Moreover  since Trump s win the U S  Treasury bonds have been witnessing massive sell offs  which in turn is leading yields on the same to rise to record levels  The 30 year US Treasuries yield jumped 7 83 basis points to cross the 3  mark for the first time this year on Monday

168421,389937,BBY,4 Retail Stocks On Bull Run With Earnings Beat Potential ,opinion," In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck  Surely  we can target stocks on a bullish run having enough fuel to go miles  If a stock is continuously in an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at such stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark they have set for themselves seems rational 
What does the trick for these types of stocks  A brief answer    sound fundamentals  is fair enough to conclude the debate  But two words seem to be insufficient unless backed by a favorable recommendation  earnings beat potential and positive estimate revisions by analysts covering the stock 
You must have noticed how some stocks skyrocket after their earnings release  Studies indicate that on an average  positive earnings surprises drive strong returns in share price for several weeks following the report  The earnings season has started and the investor community is busy tallying estimates with actuals  The reporting period is undoubtedly considered the ideal time to rebalance one s portfolio  but where to locate the greener pastures 
Retail Sector Holds the Baton This Earnings Season

Per the latest  report as of Oct 19  out of the 81 S P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers  approximately 80 2  have posted positive earnings surprises  while 63  beat top line expectations 
The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector  and of the 16 Zacks sectors  8 are expected to witness an earnings decline in Q3  with Autos  Oil Energy and Transportation being drags  However  the Retail Wholesale sector is displaying strength with total earnings expected to advance 4 5  and revenue growth of 5 3  
The recent rebound in oil prices  a favorable labor market and a gradual improvement in the manufacturing sector and housing market are signals that the economy is in recovery mode  and undoubtedly the retail sector presents a lucrative investment hub amid such a backdrop

168426,389942,BBY,NetApp  NTAP  To Post Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"NetApp Inc    NASDAQ NTAP   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 16  Last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 55 56   We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of last four trailing quarters  with an average positive surprise of 14 52  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement NETAPP INC Price and EPS Surprise

   Factors to Consider
NetApp is expected to gain momentum in the flash based solutions space  with the newly introduced all flash array  The company has been recognized a Leader in the 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Solid State Arrays  Additionally  the company s improving penetration at the mid size business segment is positive 
We believe that NetApp s recent product launches and expanding product portfolio will drive top line growth in the near term 
Further  the company is focused on consolidating its international footprint  The appointment of Fredy Cheung as area vice president  Greater China  is anticipated to boost NetApp s market share in the country 
However  tepid IT spending for the rest 2016 raises concerns about the company s near term performance  Intensifying competition from Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC   and HP Inc  add to its woes 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that NetApp will beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  currently stands at  2 63   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 37 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  NetApp has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

168427,389943,BBY,Can Cisco Systems  CSCO  Pull A Surprise In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 16  Last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5 45   We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four trailing quarters  with an average positive surprise of 7 95  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement CISCO SYSTEMS Price and EPS Surprise

   Factors to Consider
Cisco s strategy of diversifying its business by introducing software based networking tools and security services  and relying less on specialized routers and switching equipment appears to be yielding results 
Moreover  partnerships with the likes of salesforce com   NYSE CRM   and Pure Storage   NYSE PSTG   is positive for the company s top line growth  The recent acquisition of CloudLock will help it to broaden its efforts and meet the changing compliance as well as security needs 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2017  Cisco anticipates revenues to grow in the range of  1  to 1  on a year over year basis  This guidance excludes the contribution from the SP Video CPE Business 
On a non GAAP basis  gross margin is expected within 63 64  of revenues and operating margin is projected in the range of 29 30  of revenues  The company anticipates a non GAAP tax rate of 22   yielding non GAAP earnings of 58 60 cents per share 
However  the increasing competition and challenges in China remain concerns

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research  

5 Stocks Likely to Breeze Past Earnings Estimates

	The last few hours before the release of a company s quarterly financial results are crucial to investors  Their main concern is whether the companies that they are invested in can beat the earnings estimate  This is because an earnings beat generally translates into price appreciation  In fact  it works better than earnings growth in this regard  We ll tell you why 

Inside the Importance of Earnings Beat

	Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if it is a decelerating growth momentum  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals are in serious trouble 

	Also  seasonal fluctuations are a vital factor in determining a company s earnings growth  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential decline in earnings in Q1  In such cases  growth rates are fallacious when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company 

	On the other hand  Wall Street analysts rack their brains in order to study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to derive an earnings estimate 

	Thus  beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 

	Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  An impressive track record generally acts as a catalyst  sending the stock higher  It proves the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or  in other words  is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release as well 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 

Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  

Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20     This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 

   greater than zero    A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 

	In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 

Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 

Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000    High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 12 

	Here are five out of the 12 stocks 

WellCare Health Plans Inc     NYSE        This is a provider of managed care services targeted solely at government sponsored healthcare programs with the Zacks Industry Rank in the top 13   The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

168449,389965,BBY,Why The Earnings Streak Will Continue For Best Buy  BBY ,opinion,Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report  Consider Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    a firm in the Retail Consumer Electronics industry  which could be a great candidate for another beat This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  In fact  in these reports  BBY has beaten estimates by at least 25  in both cases  suggesting it has a nice short term history of crushing expectations Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago  BBY expected to post earnings of 35 cents per share  while it actually produced earnings of 44 cents per share  a beat of 25 7   Meanwhile  for the most recent quarter  the company looked to deliver earnings of 42 cents per share  when it actually produced earnings of 57 cents per share instead  representing a 35 7  surprise BEST BUY Price and EPS Surprise   Thanks in part to this history  recent estimates have been moving higher for Best Buy  In fact  the for BBY is positive  which is a great sign of a coming beat After all  the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus  looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late  suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This is the case for BBY as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 8 51   so another beat could be around the corner This is particularly true when you consider that BBY has a great Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile  You can see When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP   of the time  so it seems pretty likely that BBY could see another beat at its next report  especially if recent trends are any guide Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-10-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-streak-will-continue-for-best-buy-(bby)-200157727,200157727
168450,389966,BBY,What Makes Rite Aid  RAD  A Strong Sell ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Rite Aid Corporation   NYSE RAD    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further confirms weakness in RAD A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 2 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from 14 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 12 cents Also  for the current quarter  Rite Aid has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 5 cents a share from 6 cents over the past 30 days   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 11 6  in the past month RITE AID CORP Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Retail Wholesale sector  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see  Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-10-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-rite-aid-(rad)-a-strong-sell-200158911,200158911
168451,389967,BBY,Stocks Trade On Fresh Earnings  Global Week Ahead,opinion,I think globally to start each week  Do you  Follow me on twitter  johnblank100 This Global Week Ahead tees up a hybrid  three part schedule of events  In the simplest of statements  I don t see a big picture target driving trader sentiment If I were placing a short term bet anyway  I would go with a big surprise coming from the Q3 earnings season  It beats the other two possibilities   a final U S  presidential debate and Mario Draghi s latest rate announcement   in terms of moving stocks  The latter 2 headline events shouldn t offer  new  news Earnings season  That s where a big stock market surprise can lay in the weeds  Those of us who work at Zacks definitely subscribe to that core thesis However  a steady recent rise in oil and commodity prices  and the modest rise in producer prices in China  are big tells  A negative EPS surprise coming from the key Energy and Materials sectors is not in the Q3 cards Nevertheless  company earnings reports should be your focus   as a trader this week  and in the next few weeks First up    and most important to markets    Q3 earnings season picks up With just 7  of companies reporting last week  76  have reported earnings above their mean estimate  while 62  reported sales above mean estimates  That sounds pretty good The estimated S P 500 EPS decline for Q3 2016 stands at  1 8   If that number sticks  it will be the 6th consecutive quarter offering traders an EPS decline  Remember  though  stock markets look ahead 6 to 12 months How about stock market valuations  The forward 12 month P E ratio for the S P 500 is 16 4  This is based on the S P 500 index trading at 2132 and a forward 12 month EPS estimate of  130 08  That valuation is relatively high  but not that high  This mostly says big event risks have fallen off Second  we have a 3rd U S  Presidential debate on Wednesday   Nuff said there Also on Wednesday  we get the latest Mainland China GDP growth data  There should be no China fundamental surprises  given central planning instruments USA housing starts and permits data come out too  They look strong this fall  Though housing prices in a number of key urban markets are starting to fall back a bit  Home sellers are piling up out there  Be aware of that dynamic Finally  Mario Draghi gives up a press conference and announces his latest policy rates on Thursday   The ECB s negative rate of  0 4  is not expected to move up or down  The refi rate at 0 00  is also expected to stick around  Comments made during the

168484,390000,BBY,Buy 5 Stocks Likely To Breeze Past Earnings Estimates,opinion,"The last few hours before the release of a company s quarterly financial results are crucial to investors  Their main concern is whether the companies that they are invested in can beat the earnings estimate  This is because an earnings beat generally translates into price appreciation  In fact  it works better than earnings growth in this regard  We ll tell you why 
Inside the Importance of Earnings Beat
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if it is a decelerating growth momentum  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals are in serious trouble 
Also  seasonal fluctuations are a vital factor in determining a company s earnings growth  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential decline in earnings in Q1  In such cases  growth rates are fallacious when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company 
On the other hand  Wall Street analysts rack their brains in order to study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to derive an earnings estimate 
Thus  beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  An impressive track record generally acts as a catalyst  sending the stock higher  It proves the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or  in other words  is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release as well 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 12 
Here are five out of the 12 stocks 
WellCare Health Plans Inc     NYSE WCG     This is a provider of managed care services targeted solely at government sponsored healthcare programs with the Zacks Industry Rank in the top 13   The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

168505,390021,BBY,Why Best Buy Beat GameStop This Earnings Season,opinion,"Two of the major retail consumer electronics retailers Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   and GameStop Corp    NYSE GME   announced their second quarter results this week  However  despite operating in similar market conditions  there was a stark difference in their performances 
Shares of Best Buy have skyrocketed nearly 21  since the announcement of the results  while those of GameStop declined almost 8  during the after hour trading session on Aug 25  Keep reading to find out why investors were impressed with Best Buy and not with GameStop 
On the Earnings Front
Best Buy has consistently posted better than expected results over the last 15 quarters  In the trailing four quarters  the company s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 22   The company reported second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share of 57 cents that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents 
The company s earnings also increased 16 3  year over year  The company reported a 23 7  surge in online comparable sales driven by improved traffic and conversion rates  The company is making extensive investments to upgrade its operations with special focus on developing omni channel capabilities and strengthening its partnership with vendors BEST BUY Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   On the other hand  though GameStop surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  the year over year decline in earnings was a major concern  Notably  the company s earnings have declined year over year in the trailing two quarters 
The company reported second quarter of fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 27 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declining 12 9  year over year  The company s second quarter results were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in comparable store sales  which were primarily affected by a fall in video games and hardware sales GAMESTOP CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Revenues
Best Buy reported revenues of  8 533 million that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 401 million and inched up 0 1  year over year  In the trailing two quarters  the company s revenues have surpassed expectations  Comparable store sales  comps  were up 0 8  compared with a rise of 3 8  in the prior year period  In the third quarter of fiscal 2016  comparable sales are expected to increase nearly 1  
On the other hand  GameStop s revenues declined 7 4  year over year to  1 631 8 million and also fell short of Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 722 million  Consolidated comparable store sales  comps  dropped 10 6   reflecting comps decline of 12 5  at domestic locations and 5 9  at international locations  GameStop revenues have missed estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters 
GameStop s basic concern is the weakness prevailing in new software sales  which raises apprehensions about the impact of digital downloads on the same  In the reported quarter  new video game hardware sales plunged 33 4  to  216 4 million  whereas new video game software sales fell 18 2  to  382 2 million  For fiscal 2016  comps are expected to decline in the range of 1 5  to 4 5  compared with the previous estimate of flat to down 3  
Final Verdict
Owing to the shift in consumer buying behavior  retailers find the store in a store concept more viable and profitable to reach their target group  We believe that the strategy seems compelling to most retailers and is often considered a game changer as it facilitates the display of different brands under one roof and ensures higher footfall 
Best Buy is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues  as is evident from its strategic action of opening over 1 400  Samsung  KS 005930  Experience Shops  within its stores  Taking the initiative a step further  Best Buy also rolled out LG stores across 376 of its outlets in the reported quarter  The company has 660 Samsung and 388 Sony stores 
GameStop operates in a highly competitive video game industry where shoppers now have many alternatives to choose from when it comes to software  hardware  and game accessories for their video game consoles and personal computers  Retail bigwigs such as Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Target  Best Buy  and Game Group  who have also entered the video game market  can dent GameStop s sales and margins going forward 
Both the stocks currently have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  ",2016-08-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-best-buy-beat-gamestop-this-earnings-season-200150351,200150351

Yellen s speaks  2Q GDP revised slightly lower as expected
Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen spoke at the Central Bank s annual policy symposium in Jackson Hole  Wyoming on the subject of the Fed s monetary policy toolkit  Yellen noted that the U S  economy is now nearing the Central Bank s goals of maximum employment and price stability  Looking ahead  Yellen noted that the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  expects moderate GDP growth  additional strengthening in the labor market and inflation rising to 2 0  over the next few years  In light of this outlook  she believes the case for an increase in the fed funds rate  has strengthened in recent months   She did reiterate that the FOMC s decisions always depend on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm its outlook  and that the FOMC continues to anticipate that gradual rate increases will be appropriate 
Stocks and Treasuries gained ground on the speech and the U S  dollar remained lower  However  the markets reversed course as Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer spoke on CNBC after the speech suggesting that a September rate hike may be on the table and next week s August nonfarm payroll report will probably weigh on the decision  Fischer added that Yellen s comments were consistent with the possibility of as many as two rate hikes this year

Europe higher following Yellen s speech

U S  stocks retreated from recent record highs for the week  following Friday s highly anticipated speech from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen which culminated a week of commentary from Fed officials that raised the prospects for a rate hike this year  but did support the financial sector  Healthcare issues led to the downside amid resurfaced concerns about a crackdown on drug pricing as the U S  presidential election looms  while the energy sector stumbled as crude oil prices came under pressure amid some bearish oil inventory reports  The U S  dollar ticked higher and Treasuries were mixed  with rates on the short end of the curve moving higher  while yields on the mid to long end lost ground 
Mixed earnings and economic data likely kept conviction in check  A jump in new home sales was met with a larger than expected drop in existing home sales  while durable goods orders showed business spending may be starting to pick up  though a preliminary read on services sector activity from Markit surprisingly declined  Best Buy Co  Inc   NYSE BBY  40  rallied after its upbeat earnings report  while HP Inc  NYSE HPQ   HPQ  15  offered a disappointing outlook 
Labor report set to command attention

168526,390042,BBY,BBY Stock Soars 19  After Earnings  But Is It A Best Buy ,opinion,"This morning  Best Buy   NYSE BBY   posted results from its second quarter of fiscal 2017  and investors are rejoicing over beats achieved on the earnings and sales front   The company posted adjusted EPS of  0 57  topping our quarterly consensus estimate of  0 42 by 35 7    Best Buy topped our sales estimate of  8 401 billion as well  recording revenues of  8 533 billion over the quarter 
It should be noted that quarterly revenues almost mirror the  8 528 billion in sales generated in Q2 of fiscal 2016   Analysts expected sales to decrease over comparable quarters  but BBY did well in maintaining its revenue levels over the quarter   In spite of sales being similar to the same quarter from the prior year  net earnings climbed by 20 7    However  this large increase is possible because of a lower effective tax rate and  16 million of earnings from discontinued operations  
Investors have sent BBY shares over 19  higher today  and they are probably betting on the stock because of its 23 7  growth in comparable online sales and its ability to grow comparable sales when most people expected to see comps decline   The sales beat could lead some to believe that Best Buy can hold onto its market share and even find some growth from its online store 
As analysts digest this new information  they may revise their estimates higher for the next quarter   This has a strong chance of leading to an even higher stock price for BBY over the near term   Shares have already shot up by a strong margin  but there may be room to climb higher since the stock trades at a forward PE of just 11 45   The electronics retailer also has a low PEG of 1 16 
 BEST BUY Revenue  Quarterly     While there is reason to feel optimistic on Best Buy in the short term  one should be wary of investing in the stock over the long run   Other large retailers such as Wal Mart   NYSE WMT   and    NASDAQ AMZN   could take away more of the corporation s market share in the years to come since they are able to offer electronic products at cheaper prices   Right now  Best Buy is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but the rank could change following the release of its latest earnings report

Quarter in Detail
hhgregg reported net sales of  424 0 million  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  it decreased 4  year over year due to a decline of 3 9  in comparable store sales  We note that the comparable store sales decline was however narrower than a decline of 9 3  in the preceding quarter and a decline of 6 3  in the prior year quarter  This was due to improved momentum  especially in the appliance category 
Despite a competitive environment  adjusted gross margin expanded 50 basis points  bps  to 31 0  in the quarter owing to favorable product sales mix to categories with higher gross margin rates such as appliances and home products  partially offset by lower gross profit margin rates in consumer electronics 
However  selling  general and administrative  SG A  expense ratio increased 30 basis points  bps  to 25 5  due to increases in wages as a result of one time labor costs  higher credit card charge backs  increases in delivery services and higher occupancy cost 
Adjusted EBITDA increased to  2 01 million in the first quarter  up more than 50  from  4 13 million in the prior year quarter  We note that the improved EBITDA was due to the company s expense reduction initiatives HHGREGG INC Price and Consensus   Category Details
The company reports its business under the following product categories 
Appliances  Comparable store sales in this category increased 3 7  in the quarter due to increase in sales volume  offset by a decrease in average selling price  In the year ago quarter  comp sales had decreased 2 2

Home Products  Same store sales in this category increased 0 3  in the quarter driven by higher average selling prices offset by a decline in unit sales in the category 
The Home products category continues to grow at a faster pace  with furniture realizing positive comps of 7 7  in the quarter  offset by a decline in bedding  The company also believes the store reset initiative has infused positive growth in the category  The company is now tracking the resetting of 140 stores by the holiday period and all of its stores within this fiscal year 
Consumer Electronics  Same store sales of this category declined significantly by 17 4  in the quarter  The decline was due to a decrease in units sold within the video category  which makes up 75  of this category  as well as a double digit decline in average selling price  The decline was wider than a decline of 14 8  in the prior year quarter 
The company is working on several initiatives for the consumer electronics category to revive this difficult segment  These initiatives are expected to yield positive results in the consumer electronics space throughout the balance of this fiscal year

168572,390088,BBY,Your  Best Buy  For A 10  Move,opinion,"Everybody wants a bargain  If you are looking for a TV you go to an electronics store like Best Buy  NYSE BBY   If you are looking for a good stock then you go to   well Best Buy again  This stock has moved in a tightening range over the past 3 years  but for the next few months it could give a very positive move higher 
The chart below of the weekly price action shows why  The longer pattern in play is a symmetrical triangle  With the price making a series of higher lows and higher highs since August 2013  the tightening range yields a triangle  Notice that the price has bounced from the top to the bottom to the top and then the bottom again  Currently it is rising toward the top  A straight up move from here would give a 10  return 

The momentum indicators support continuation higher  The RSI is rising and in the bullish zone while the MACD is positive and moving higher  The trigger would be a move over the resistance in place from the March 2016 high  A close this week over 34 75 will do that 
But there is potential for more as well  Should the price break through the top of the triangle it would give a target  21 above the break out point  That is a whole lot more than 10   The triangle carries the power for the biggest moves about 2 3 of the way into the apex  Right now it is about 58  through  so after a 10  move higher it would be close to the best case  So go in for a small deal and maybe leave with a blockbuster deal ",2016-08-11,Gregory W.

Best Buy s biggest problem lately has been the ongoing transition towards its online services  Last quarter and year featured nearly 14  gains in comparable online sales while brick and mortar continue to suffer  Best Buy s move earlier this year to offer same day delivery in major market should bode well for online sales  Currently online sales account for 11  of domestic revenue and as its new initiatives take off  this number should increase
In its brick and mortar stores  the computer and mobile phone categories have been Best Buy s bread and butter  The segment accounted for 46  of revenue followed by consumer electronics was at 36   However  high smartphone penetration coupled with low consumer demand has hurt the company s mobile phone business  Currency headwinds and weak economic conditions have also put pressure on these sectors 
Meanwhile  in Wal Mart s  NYSE WMT  recent analyst call they indicated that they would lower prices even further  This will have a widespread impact on all retailers including Best Buy who will have to enter the pricing war at the cost of margins

Looking at the chart you will see that shares are looking to open lower than yesterdays close of  33 with premarket lows coming in at  31 15  a 5 6  decrease in price  We should see some support come in at  31 and  30 with ascending support at 29 15 while resistance will be met at  32 and  32 42  where the 200 day moving average currently sits  Look for above normal volatility on this name as volume will pick up with more traders looking to take advantage of the big price movement 
CEO Comments

Our teams delivered a strong first quarter  with better than expected revenue  improved profitability and progress against our fiscal 2017 initiatives   said Best Buy Chairman and CEO Hubert Joly   We are reaffirming our previously provided full year financial outlook which includes approximately flat revenue and non GAAP operating income  with non GAAP EPS growth driven by share repurchases  Although we are reporting better than expected results today  we are not raising our full year outlook as the first quarter represents less than 15  of full year earnings and at this stage we have no new material information as it relates to product launches throughout the year 
Joly continued   In our Domestic business  we are reporting essentially flat comparable sales versus guidance of a 1  to 2  decline driven by strong year over year sales growth in health   wearables  home theater and appliances offset by continued softness in mobile phones and tablets  Contributing to these better than expected results was the strong performance in our online channel  which grew 24  in the quarter

After reporting earnings  BBY gapped down 6 8   Buyers stepped right in from there and at one point were able to put BBY into the green  I bought put options to fade the fade  A month later the stock had effectively gone nowhere  so I rolled over the expiration one more month  It just so happened that BBY reported holiday sales directly ahead of the January expiration  I closed out the position as the stock fell as much as 12 5   This time  buyers were only able to reverse a small fraction of the losses 


Best Buy  BBY  has hit prices last seen May  2014  Can the remaining money in the buyback keep the stock from bleeding even more 
While the holiday sales report contained warnings  it also contained some assurances and an important catalyst that could make BBY a good bet off the bottom going into earnings roughly in late February early March 

First the warnings 

Domestic revenue declined 0 8  led by greater than expected revenue declines in mobile phones and NPD related categories  a revenue drop of 4 8    The NPD Group includes TVs  desktop and notebook computers  tablets not including Kindle  digital imaging and other categories  BBY indicated sales of NPD products are about 65  of domestic revenue  As a result of the unexpected declines  BBY reduced guidance for domestic Q4 revenue growth from flat to a decline of 1 5  

Next  the assurances 

BBY also improved Q4 guidance for a non GAAP operating income rate decline of 20 to 35 basis points to 10 to 15 basis points  Guidance for the international business remains unchanged  Canada is a large driver of an expected 30  decline in revenue  partially thanks to the sharp decline in the Canadian dollar  

Most importantly  BBY announced that it will continue to repurchase shares through the end of the fourth quarter  The company has already spent a considerable amount  so the stakes are high for this buyback 


 On March 3  2015  the company announced the intent to repurchase  1 billion worth of its shares over a three year period  On a year to date basis  the company has already repurchased 17 8 million shares for a total of  588 million   of which 6 6 million shares  or  203 million  were repurchased in the nine week period ended January 2  2016  The company intends to continue to repurchase shares through the end of the fourth quarter  


BBY closed at  39 18 share on March 3rd and traded as high as  41 77 share that month in the wake of the news on repurchases  BBY has not traded higher since  This latest news reveals that the company  fortunately  will end up spending the majority of its funds at much cheaper prices  Still  the average price for the 6 6M shares repurchased is  33 share  a whopping 28  higher than current levels  The promise to continue this furious pace of buying through the end of the fourth quarter should at a minimum put a floor under the stock  The buybacks apparently succeeded at putting a floor under the stock until the report on holiday sales  I am guessing BBY management is quite surprised by the depth of the market s reaction  With the stock market extremely oversold  I am expecting BBY to participate strongly in any relief rallies going forward  I have started out nibbling on a few call options as one part of my oversold trading 

Be careful out there

168750,390266,BBY,Wal Mart  Can This Once Safe Haven Retailer Fix What s Broken ,opinion,"By Clement Thibault
With nearly 11 600 stores worldwide  5 000 of which are in the US  Wal Mart  N WMT  is the biggest bricks and mortar retailer in the world  It has also been one of the safest stocks to invest in over the past decade 
Remember the financial crisis at the end of 2008  It didn t effect Wal Mart stock one bit  While the market was melting down  Wal Mart s stock gained 17 95   That s at the same time that the S P 500 lost a terrifying 36 55  

Although the S P s growth over subsequent years was stronger  had an investor put  1 000 into both WMT and the SPX on January 1st 2008  they d still be further ahead with their Wal Mart shares  And that s without taking into account Wal Mart s growing dividend  which currently yields about 3  
Unfortunately  since the beginning of 2015  Wal Mart s status as an overachiever appears to be ancient history  While the S P largely stagnated in 2015  the retailer s shares tumbled 28 62  its biggest annual loss in decades 

WMT s miserable performance in 2015 was largely due to the big drop in the company s profitability  Twelve months trailing  Wal Mart s EPS fell from 5 06 to 4 59 about 9 percent  At the same time  compared with last year  it recorded a drop in earnings over every single quarter  In and of itself  a 9  slip in profits might not warrant a 28  loss of value in its shares  However  one of Wal Mart s problems is that it already operates on a very thin profit margin  Those  Everyday Low Prices  don t come cheaply for the company 
Take Q3  15 for example  Over that period  WMT reported  117 4B in revenue   87 4B in COGS  cost of goods sold   and  24 2B in SGA  sales  general and administrative expenses   leaving the company with  5 7B of operating income  Subtract its  1 7B tax bill  and you re left with  3 4B of net income  Based on their Q3 earnings report  Wal Mart s profit margin currently stands at a razor thin 2 8   while the industry s overall average net profit margin is considerably higher  at 4 23   That s 46  more than Wal Mart is making 
Another key issue the retailer currently faces is rising employment costs  as government mandated minimum wage hikes threaten to reduce the company s already slim profit margin  Wal Mart employs some 1 4 million US based staff  which amounts to hundreds of millions of man hours needing to be paid each month  A one dollar raise  per person  in labor costs could cut an additional  300 million quarterly from the bottom line  resulting in another 10  drop in profits 
If all that weren t enough  its biggest e tail rival Amazon  O AMZN  continues growing  as it remains unaffected by the many challenges that keep hitting bricks and mortar competitors  including Wal Mart  Among Amazon s advantages  an almost nonexistent physical presence and a large army of robots at its disposal  which dramatically reduces the need for human labor  and human scale wages  
There was some talk last earnings season of WMT enhancing their online retail division  and at the end of 2015 the company launched  Walmart Pay   an app that allows customers to pay for merchandise via their smartphones  The company has also merged all its tech divisions into a new group it calls    whose mandate is to revolutionize Wal Mart s digital retail efforts so they become more competitive versus Amazon 
Clearly  Wal Mart is starting to recognize its problems  CEO Doug McMillon said in late 2015 that the company would review its operations and shut down underperforming stores  Indeed  on January 15th of this year  Wal Mart announced the closure of 269 locations  kicking off a program to get itself back on track  The retailer s sheer size makes it harder for the company to stay flexible  but this is a good first step  Still  Wal Mart is by no means shrinking  It plans to open more than 100 stores in the US this year  as well as an additional 200  stores overseas 
All of this leaves Wal Mart in a delicate position heading into Q4  15 earnings and into 2016 in general  Its business is struggling  its profit margin is shrinking  but it is making the effort to stay relevant  So what might that mean for the company  and its stock after it reports 
Wal Mart is like a mammoth dinosaur desperately trying to evolve before the ice age ends  Unfortunately  like the dinosaur  its massive size alone won t save it  At the end of the day in business as in nature it all comes down to the survival of the fittest  This doesn t mean we re seeing the end of the road for Wal Mart just yet  But just like its fellow retailers Macy s  N M  and Best Buy  N BBY   to name two it has a lot of adapting to do 
WMT s 2014 Q4 report showed an EPS of 1 58  already down at that time from 1 60 in Q4 2013  This downtrend is set to continue  which should be more visible when Wal Mart reports Q4 earnings before the bell on Thursday  February 18th  Forecasts call for 1 43 EPS and expected revenue of  131 6B ",2016-02-17,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-this-once-reliable-retail-stalwart-fix-what's-broken-384842,384842

168774,390290,BBY,Bearish Shorts Just In Case,opinion,"The market was little changed Tuesday based on the S P 500  But a look at both the NASDAQ and Russell indicates that the S P 500 masked a lot of the day s weakness 
The tendency  as we ve seen a huge run in the market since the beginning of the month  is to get nervous about holding current positions any longer  Kind of like being afraid of heights the higher you climb 
However  if you look at the current price action on the daily SPX or SPY  you ll find that price still remains above even the shortest time frame moving averages  like the 5 day  So while I m somewhat tempted to short a stock like Best Buy  N BBY   which is setting up beautifully for the downside  I ve held out until now to see if the market is willing to roll over 
For now check out the bearish list of stocks below and identify the ones that meet your requirements for a good reward risk setup

168800,390316,BBY,Devastating Trends In  Economic Growth ,opinion,"Economic growth   who could possibly be against that  Okay  the environmentalists are  but certainly not me  However  when we define exactly what constitutes economic growth  I d have to say I m against what today passes for it  an ever increasing number of dollars of GDP  Don t get me wrong  if someone offered me a few hundred thousand dollars of GDP  like many members of Congress  I would take it  But I know where these dollars come from  they are borrowed into existence by the US Treasury from the US central bank  What will they ultimately be worth someday in our uncertain future  Nothing 
The following quote from C  Edward Griffin tells the little known story of how dollars are created 
The Mandrake Mechanism
The American dollar has no intrinsic value  It is a classic example of fiat money with no limit to the quantity that can be produced  Its primary value lies in the willingness of people to accept it and  to that end  legal tender laws require them to do so  It is true that our money is created out of nothing  but it is more accurate to say that it is based upon debt  In one sense  therefore  our money is created out of less than nothing  The entire money supply would vanish into bank vaults and computer chips if all debts are repaid  Under the present system  therefore  our leaders cannot allow a serious reduction in either the national or consumer debt  Charging interest on pretended loans is usury  and that has become institutionalized under the Federal Reserve System  The Mandrake Mechanism by which the Fed converts debt into money may seem complicated at first  but it is simple if one remembers that the process is not intended to be logical  but to confuse and deceive  The end product of the Mechanism is artificial expansion of the money supply  which is the root cause of the hidden tax called inflation  The expansion then leads to contraction and  together  they produce the destructive boom bust cycle that has plagued mankind throughout history wherever fiat money has existed 
My first chart tells the shocking tale  which is why we ll never see it published in any economic textbook  In the chart s table  we see that US GDP was only  104 billion in 1929  Today  there are more billions of dollars at the table when Bill Gates and Warren Buffet get together to play bridge than total goods and services in the entire American economy back in 1929  But in 1929   104 billion dollars represented the wealth of an entire continent  not just two guys playing cards

In 1929  the national debt was a mere  17 billion dollars  just sixteen percent of total GDP  Today  it s over  18 000 billion dollars  and exceeds total GDP  US Currency in Circulation  CinC   paper dollars and coins in circulation  was only  3 90 billion back in 1929  I believe Oprah and Michael Jordan could cover that amount today  What hasn t gone ballistic since 1929 are the nation s gold reserves  In 1929  the dollar was fixed at about 1 20th ounce of gold  and the US Treasury had more in gold reserves than paper dollars in circulation  CinC   Today  CinC is two orders of magnitude greater than the Treasury s gold reserves  As stunning as that may be  over the past nine decades  the national debt has grown by three orders of magnitude  These trends are certainly not sustainable  and considering everything now going on in the world  the inevitable crisis can t be far away  Will 2015 be the year of crisis  Like me  you ll have to hang in there to find out 
The next chart plots the growth in annual production of nickel  cement and pig iron along with CinC and GDP since 1929  For your information  CinC  Blue Plot  is calculated using the year end quantity of dollars in circulation since 1929  so the CinC plot is not exactly equivalent to the others  But it does make the point that it s misleading to measure  economic growth  using an inflationary monetary unit  Scientifically  the best way to analyze any relationship is to observe the changes in a single variable  GDP  while holding all other variables constant  Using the dollar as the unit to measure GDP introduces a second variable  the purchasing power of the dollar over time as determined by the number of dollars in circulation  CinC  
Unfortunately  US GDP  Purple Plot  is based upon annual sales of goods and services measured in dollars  a variable  not a constant unit   If GDP is rising faster than annual production of basic commodities  it s because the finished goods and services are measured in a wasting asset  the dollar   So most of the increase in GDP since 1929 has primarily been due to rising prices  not from increases in goods and services available in the economy 

Next  the chart plotting copper  gold and silver  Sorry  but the green gold plot has increased so little relative to the blue CinC and purple GDP plots  it looks like it s missing   but it s there 

Here s a table listing the 1929 to 2013 increase of the same items plotted above  along with some others  It should be obvious that GDP computed by government statisticians is just another bogus  growth  data series  Since CinC has not been kept constant  it is impossible to separate that portion of GDP growth resulting from actual increases in the production of goods and services  from the portion resulting from increases in CinC  So  in 2015  it s not surprising to see  growth  in GDP  even as employment opportunities continually dwindle 

My favorite measurement of true economic growth is weekly electrical power consumption s 52Wk moving average  a measurement of economic growth based upon the kilowatt  an engineering unit of measurement whose definition has been fixed since its conception  Barron s statistics department has published this weekly data series continuously since August 1929   Thanks guys 

In the red box above  we see the Federal Government s accelerating production of paper dollars since the sub prime mortgage crisis  However  this huge increase in circulating dollars has had no impact on electrical power usage since August 2008  As we see in EP s Bear s Eye View chart below  it s been a long time since EP has made a new BEV Zero  new all time high   with no sign of recovery to 2008 levels of power consumption any time soon  With self serving politicians and academics in control of  economic  and  monetary policy   I personally expect the current decline in EP to bottom only after it exceeds its 1933 bottom of  17 32   but I hope I m wrong 
When I look at these charts  the following quote concerning the economic collapse of the Western Roman Empire from William Durant comes to mind 

 Morals  which had been loosened by riches and wealth had not been improved by destitution and chaos  for few conditions are more demoralizing than poverty that comes after wealth  

  Will Durant  Caesar and Christ  page 211 

Let s pray it doesn t come to that for us because as the Greeks have discovered  we live in a very uncertain world controlled by people at the top of the food chain who don t give a damn about anything but themselves  Now some may point out that Greek socialism s attitude was much the same  But  had the global banking system been forced to live under the discipline imposed by the old gold standard  Greek socialists  and American consumers  would be better off  having long ago been forced to live within their means 
 Economic growth  seen in rising stock market valuations is also distorted by monetary inflation  Since 1920  the Dow Jones  Green Plot below  has seen major advances in dollar terms  but only once did it exceed the increase in the rate of production of dollars in circulation  during the Roaring 1920s bull market  In the decades that followed  even at its current lofty level of 18 000  the Dow Jones has failed to keep up with increases in CinC inflation 
Now  compare how the Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI   Red Plot  has performed relative to CinC inflation over the decades  From 1965 to 1996  the advance in the BGMI was either above the rate of CinC inflation or just below it  Mr  Bear finally took the BGMI down in 2001  then twice in the past fourteen years  March 2008 and April 2011   it attempted to rise above the rate of CinC inflation  Both these post 2001 advances in the BGMI were powerful upward thrusts  outperforming anything the Dow Jones had done since the 1920s 

Better yet to look at the 30 and 90 month gains in the Dow Jones in the chart below  Thirty months being the length of time the BGMI advanced 248  from November 2008 to April 2011  The 90 month gains for the Dow Jones correspond to the length of time the BGMI advanced 526  from August 2000 to March 2008 

Next are the 30 and 90 month gains for the BGMI  Since 1922  the Dow Jones has never seen a bull market advance comparable to percentage gains seen in the BGMI  That the financial media provided no proper coverage of the gold mining shares during two significant bull market run ups since 2000 should raise questions  Had the gold mining shares received any sponsorship by the media to inform investors of a profitable market opportunity  the gains in the BGMI would have been significantly higher 

Had the  policy makers  not whacked gold mining shares at their March 2008 and April 2011 tops  I expect we d see the BGMI currently performing well above the rate of CinC inflation  just as it did decades ago  Looking at the 90 month gain  Red Plot  above  had the  policy makers  not interfered in the precious metals market in early 2008  it wouldn t have surprised me to see the BGMI s 90 month gain rise to new all time highs by a considerable margin  Today  after more than a decade of  monetary policy  shenanigans  the current depressed level of the BGMI is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has made the effort to study market history  but a sad fact nonetheless 
The next chart documents an amazing fact on the long term  growth  for the Dow Jones earnings  since 1929  for every billion dollars of currency put into circulation  the Dow Jones attempted to produce about one dollar in earnings  But since 1979  every time the Dow Jones actually does manage to produce a dollar in earnings per billion dollars in circulation  something bad happens to the Dow s earnings and sometimes to the Dow Jones itself 
The last time the Dow s earnings managed to reach one billionth the amount of currency in circulation was in the first week of November 2007  a month past the peak of the Dow Jones sub prime bull market  General Motors   NYSE GM  disastrous earnings report in the second week of November marked the beginning of the Dow Jones  second deepest bear market since 1885  as Dow earnings crumbled by more than  900 over the next year  In August 2008  earnings for the Dow Jones went negative for the first time since 1932 

However  there was one major difference between the earnings collapses of 1932 and 2008  The Great Depression earnings collapse took twenty years before the Dow s earnings returned to their peak level of April 1930  and twenty five years for the Dow Jones itself to return to its September 1929 all time high  With the credit crisis collapse in earnings  the Dow Jones  earnings soared to new all time highs in just four years  and the Dow Jones itself made a new all time high just 5 5 years after its October 2007 peak  It s no mystery why the credit crisis crash recovered so quickly  the difference between the two market events was the direct intervention by the Federal Reserve to re inflate market valuations and corporate earnings 
What could be wrong with that  Nothing  as far as Doctor Bernanke is concerned  as we see in the quote below 

     the U S  government has a technology  called a printing press  or  today  its electronic equivalent   that allows it to produce as many U S  dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost  

  Doctor B S  Bernanke  Federal Reserve Board Governor  November 21  2002
But it occurs to me that when something  like corporate earnings and stocks trading in the stock market  is defined in terms of something  the dollar  that is potentially infinite in quantity  which is produced at  no cost   then what value do the stocks that trade in the stock market or their earnings actually have  I ll be the first to admit that few would jump to the conclusion that they are worth nothing  Currently  people who see value in the dollar are correct  but they will be so for only as long as the dollar remains a monetary unit that people are willing to use as a means of exchange in their economic activities 
But there are those  including Timothy Geithner  Obama s first Treasury Secretary  who are on record discussing whether to terminate the dollar s reserve currency status  Organizations such as the IMF have been preparing for the demise of the dollar for decades with their SDR  for the good reasons seen in these charts  the mindless expansion of debt and currency  Here s a CNN link where the IMF calls for an alternative to the dollar as the global reserve currency from February 2011  The IMF claimed their  Special Drawing Rights  or SDRs  could help stabilize the global financial system   No explanation is given as to how the global financial system became unstable  or why those at the highest levels of global finance saw the need to consider an alternative to the US dollar  CNN  as always  dumb as a rock  never bothered to ask 
It s all very sad  and we can see the effects of this pernicious  monetary policy  on  American consumers  in the chart below  But it s no different than what is now happening in the European Union thanks to the ECB   economic growth   debt and currency creation   Red  Green and Black Plots  is expanding faster than personal income  Blue Plot   Wage earners attempt to augment their lagging earning power by leveraging their purchases with consumer debt  Red Plot   But eventually  debt service for their personal debts and increases in taxes to service the national debt  Green Plot  consumes their income 

If you re wondering why retail chains like Best Buy  NYSE BBY  and fast food outlets like McDonald s  NYSE MCD  are closing stores  it s because the thugs controlling the Federal Reserve and the ECB have impoverished their countries  middle class with  economic growth   aka the expansion of credit and currency  an expansion as noted by Doctor B S  Bernanke  that cost them nothing  but will eventually cost the laboring classes everything  We live in a world that has rejected the Judeo Christian ethics of right and wrong that have served the West so well for so long  choosing instead to embrace the Darwinian notions of academia and their minions in government and finance  So don t be surprised that today the strong are now feeding on the weak because we now live in a world where might and the ability to create unlimited currency and credit makes right ",2015-07-19,Mark Lundeen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/devastating-trends-in-“economic-growth”-258738,258738
168801,390317,BBY,Is Amazon Going To Soar To New All Time Highs ,opinion,"Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  reports its FQ2  15 results after the closing bell tomorrow  Currently  the Estimize community have 106 estimates and are predicting an EPS figure of   0 07 compared to Wall Street which predict   0 17  Estimize are also predicting higher revenues of  22 422B relative to Wall Street s  22 308B consensus 

Amazon has been a fantastic investment year to date  YTD  returning a capital gain of 56 86  compared to the NASDAQ which has appreciated 9 04   Amazon has also been able to outperform some of its key competitors  YTD  including eBay  EBAY  and Alibaba  NYSE BABA  who have returned 17 80  and  20 57  respectively 
Amazon s success can be attributed to a whole range of impressive fundamentals  However Amazon s revenue growth figures are certainly a major contributor to its success  In Amazon s FQ1  15 results  the company reported YoY revenue growth of 15 08  which is substantially higher than its competitors including Best Buy Co  NYSE BBY  and Barnes   Noble Inc  NYSE BKS  who recorded negative figures of  0 94  and  10 43  respectively 
Amazon s continued success with respect to revenue growth has allowed the company to seal market share from big name players such as Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Best Buy  BBY   Amazon recently held its  Prime Day   held for Amazon Prime members and topped expectations  Although the sales figures from Prime Day are not recorded in tomorrow s release  the strong result is helping move Amazon s share price higher  One hurdle Amazon may face with respect to revenue growth comes through a new market entrant in Jet com  Jet officially opened on Tuesday and are promising to offer lower prices than Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   The business relies on a subscription model offering customers attractive membership rewards through lower prices  A recent study conducted by Boomerang Commerce found that Jet com was cheaper than Amazon 81  of the time  Importantly  the study that was conducted used a small sample size of only 100 different products from various categories 
Despite all the positive fundamentals associated with Amazon at present  investors will want to obtain more guidance regarding management s spending plans moving forward  Amazon has a track record of poor investment purchases including the well publicized flop that was the Amazon Fire Phone  These decisions have resulted in Amazon recording EPS declines for three of the past four quarters  with the exception of the holiday quarter  
Tomorrow s report will be an important one for Amazon as the company looks to beat expectations to ensure share price strength for the upcoming quarter  If the report disappoints however  the stock could experience a significant re rating downwards  Amazon is currently trading near all time highs and is vulnerable to falls if the market is unimpressed with the results ",2015-07-23,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-amazon-going-to-soar-to-new-all-time-highs-259261,259261

168803,390319,BBY,This Retailer Blew Away Investors  Expectations,opinion,"Before Best Buy  NYSE BBY  announced its Q2 earnings results today  the giant electronic retailer was stirring up a lot of debate within the investing community  Many thought that Best Buy would be able to continue its profitability from last quarter while others were skeptical of Best Buy s earnings potential  believing it s doomed to fail in its fight against Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and other electronic retailers  At market close yesterday  Estimize consensus stood at  0 35 EPS  just one cent higher than the Wall Street consensus of  0 34  The Estimize consensus anticipated revenues of  8 32B  slightly higher than the  8 30B predicted by Wall Street  However  this morning  Best Buy surprised the investing community with its Q2 EPS of  0 49  a 17  increase from Q2 last year  beating Wall Street consensus by  0 15 and Estimize consensus by  0 14  Its revenue of  8 53B also beats consensus by  240M and  210M respectively  As a result  Best Buy s stocks increased  11 4  premarket and currently stands at  33 57 

The  Omni  Strategy
Best Buy stocks have been volatile in the past year  The stock had plummeted early in the year and slowly rose until its 52 week high of  42 mid March  Since then  BBY stocks have been trending downwards  declining until its closing price yesterday at  29  just barely above its 52 week low  Over the past year  Best Buy has focused on its Renew Blue restructuring program that involves not only cost cutting but also omni channel retailing  reaching customers wherever they are  Their cost cutting efforts have gone better than originally expected  saving over  1B for the company  The company s Q2 domestic gross profit rate also increased  130bps to 24 7   while the international gross profit rate came in a little lower at 23 4  due to large restructuring efforts abroad  Some of their changes included closing 66 stores branded under Future Shop  its Canadian brand  and converting the remaining 65 stores into Best Buy locations  As a result of store closures and F X pressures  Best Buy saw its international sales drop by 26  to  650M  The domestic segment did much better  with revenue increasing 3 9  to  7 88B

Many investors were concerned with Best Buy s ability to grow its online business and extend its online sales distribution network through their omni channeling efforts  However  it appears that the omni channeling strategy has proven successful in combating the consistent  showroom  culture  The company saw a 17  rise in online sales  positively contributing to a strong 3 8  increase in comparable store sales 

BBY data by YCharts
However  there is still a long way to go  At this time  many customers are urging for Best Buy to catch up on their delivery efforts  Aside from competition with online retailers who offer services such as Amazon Prime 2 day shipping  traditional retailer Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT  has also declared their efforts in expanding their 2 day or less delivery to 95  of the population  Best Buy s standard shipping is still 3 7 days with free shipping limited to an order of  35 and over  The electronic giant is also facing challenges from slowing consumer electronic spending  United States census bureau has revealed weak retail sales in recent months and future macro economic data might create further problems for the company  So far  Best Buy has definitely done better than expected but whether it can keep its current trend remains to be seen ",2015-08-25,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-retailer-blew-away-investors’-expectations-262917,262917
168806,390322,BBY,One Of The  Best Buys  Out There,opinion,"This  NYSE big box store  had been left for dead a year ago  Known as the showroom for Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   people would browse and try out products before ordering them from Amazon  sometimes without even leaving the store  So what happened  You can go to any number of analyst reports to see about the health of the company  I am less concerned with that 
What gets me excited is that the stock is showing relative strength to the market during this broad correction  In fact it s showing real strength too  The chart below shows that it had been in a downtrending channel after peaking at  42 in February  right after the Superbowl  It hit the bottom of the channel last Monday as the market gapped lower  But since then it has continued to move up  despite the stalls and reversal in the broad market 

On Tuesday  the price pulled back minimally  but was still above the recent resistance area  which could turn into support at 35 30  A bit of consolidation or pullback after a 30  run higher can help reset the momentum indicators  Even a pullback to 34 would not be bad for the chart  Perhaps place a buy order at 34 or sell the September 34 Puts  at 65 cents as I write  for a possible short term entry ",2015-09-01,Gregory W.

168824,390340,BBY,Playing Best Buy Into Earnings,opinion,"I like holding the cards  or at least stacking the odds in my favor  Let me show you what I mean  I had a major technical long trigger Tuesday morning in Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY   Here s the chart   Not to get too  technical  here  but we have two major indicators that signaled the long  First is what I call an inside bar entry and second was how it put in lows at or near the 200 Day Moving Average three days in a row rejection at support   So for me  it s onwards and upwards  hopefully   As an options trader  my first instinct is to do one of three things  buy at the money calls  buy a call vertical or sell a put vertical  Depending on the reward to risk  I typically make a play along these lines  But BBY is a bit unique at this point in the cycle 
Earnings are scheduled for May 20th  What if I can make a directional bet but still leave myself opportunities come earnings  I can do exactly that  For example  I can buy the regular May expiration 37 5 call vs  the 5 22 weekly expiration call calendar for a debit of  0 50  If we go down  we do have our  0 50 of premium at risk  That risk would be there with a straight vertical or call option buy though 
But we may have the opportunity to  double up  if we do rally  If we have a controlled grind up I can sell out of my calendar for a profit  But what can also happen is that the regular May options expire worthless and then I can turn around and spread off my existing weekly position to even increase my leverage more  The important thing is that I get to choose  exit for a profit or lever up into more and more profit ",2015-04-29,Trading Advantage,https://www.investing.com/analysis/playing-best-buy-into-earnings-250073,250073

168967,390483,BBY,The Bear Case For Best Buy In One Simple Chart,opinion,Americans quickly transitioned from gobbling up turkeys to gobbling up the deals at their favorite retail stores  According to the National Retail Federation  139 million unique shoppers hit up the malls during the holiday weekend  That s up 6  from last year  The anecdotal reports coming in are promising  too  Stores like Macy s  M  and Toys R Us reported that people weren t restricting their purchases to sale items alone  In other words  bargains be damned  Americans appear to be in the shopping mood  Period  So it s only natural that  as investors  we start looking for opportunities in retail stocks  After all  many retailers book upwards of 40  of sales and profits during the holiday season  So it s make or break time for retail businesses   and  in turn  their stocks  Whatever you do  though  don t even think about playing the brewing opportunity in retail by investing in big box electronics retailer  Best Buy  BBY   Like its former competitor  Circuit City  the company s doomed for the trash heap  Here s why  in one simple chart  It s All About the Internet  Stupid I m a gadget guy  and an avid football fan  So I never turn down an opportunity to browse Best Buy s stores for the newest toy or super sized  high definition television  Notice I said  browse   though  I never buy anything at Best Buy anymore because I can almost always get better deals online  Therein lies the company s fatal flaw  It s a traditional  brick and mortar retail store in a day and age when more and more Americans are doing more and more shopping online  And the transition away from in store purchases is most pronounced in the electronics industry  Take a look  Since the beginning of 2009  the total share of retail sales for electronics and appliances stores has been declining  Meanwhile  the total share of sales for non store retailers  i e    online merchants  keeps climbing  Therefore  Best Buy s stock slump  down 45 8  this year  isn t an isolated occurrence related to poor management  bad marketing  or any other individualized factor  It s symptomatic of the entire industry s downturn  Put simply  big box retail is on a   thanks to stiff competition from online players like Amazon  AMZN   And there s nothing the Best Buys of the world can do about it  Part of the reason they can t compete is the heavy burden of traditional brick and mortar infrastructure  In the last six months  Best Buy invested  316 million in property and equipment  Meanwhile  the only money Amazon spent on  property  was for intellectual property  And traditional retailers can t adapt fast enough to survive  Amazon demonstrated the viability of an online only sales model over a decade ago  Yet Best Buy still only generates about 5  of total sales online today  Sorry  but if Best Buy didn t transition to an online model yet  it s way too late  Even if we ignore Best Buy s fatal flaw  its other fundamentals hardly warrant consideration  Same store sales   a key retail metric   dropped 4 3  over the last six months  The company s saddled with  2 billion in debt  prompting the rating agencies to put it on watch for a potential debt downgrade  That s never an encouraging development  Plus  management recently suspended its share buyback program to preserve capital  So  logically  the next thing on the chopping block is the company s dividend  At  0 68 per year  it represents a  229 million outlay for a company with only  309 million in cash in the bank  Newsflash  Shareholders don t tend to respond positively to dividend cuts or suspensions   Think   RSH    Bottom line  More and more retail spending is migrating online  And there s nothing Best Buy can do to stop it  That alone tells us an investment in Best Buy is doomed  And when we take the time to review the company s fundamentals  we find even more reasons to avoid it ,2012-11-28,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-bear-case-for-best-buy-in-one-simple-chart-145337,145337

169010,390526,BBY,Best Buy  Options Reflect Upside Potential ,opinion,Best Buy Co   Inc   BBY  is a multinational retailer of consumer electronics  computing and mobile phone products  entertainment products  appliances and related services   This is a vol and skew note on a company embroiled in what appears to be an unwanted private takeover bid from its ex Chairman  Let s start with some news  then move onto the vol  n stuff  n stuff  I do also note that I wrote about BBY on 7 2 2012  sort of a precursor to the current news  You can read that post here  Here s the news that started this story  Reuters    Best Buy Co Inc s  BBY N  former Chairman Richard Schulze is not expected to present a buyout or other proposal to the company s board anytime soon  a person familiar with the situation said  Media reports said Schulze was close to presenting an offer for the consumer electronics chain  Discussions around a leveraged buyout of the company are still in the early stages  the person said     Source  Reuters via Yahoo  Finance    reporting By Nadia Damouni  editing by Gerald E  McCormick   So that was sort of no news with news expected soon  but denied  But here are some headlines from Briefing com in chronological order  Provided by Briefing com     06 Jul 12 15 23 ET  Best Buy to layoff 2400 employees   CNBC 11 Jul 12 09 33 ET  HHGregg at a 3 5 year low following Q1 warning and FY13 guidance cut  now off  32   7 80  3 74   Update BBY  6  13 Jul 12 09 42 ET  Best Buy trading lower off the open  Hearing cautious comments at Cleveland Research 30 Jul 12 08 44 ET  Best Buy spikes to  20 then comes back to   19 following renewed takeover reports  30 Jul 12 08 43 ET  Best Buy founder Schulze recruting executive team for buyout   Bloomberg 06 Aug 12 08 35 ET  Best Buy Founder Richard Schulze confirms proposal to acquire BBY for  24 00 to  26 00 per shareRichard Schulze  Founder and former Chairman of BBY  submitted a written proposal to the Best Buy Board of Directors to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the company that he does not already own for a price of  24 00 to  26 00 per share in cash  The purchase price  which is based on current public information and is subject to due diligence  represents a premium of 36  to 47  to Best Buy s closing stock price of  17 64 on August 3  2012  Schulze is Best Buy s largest shareholder  controlling 20 1  of Best Buy shares   And finally  the news yesterday 29 Aug 12 07 08 ET  Best Buy  Buyout feasible albeit unlikely   Oppenheimer  OpCo notes clients continue to ask whether the firm believes former BBY chairman Richard Schulze will prove successful in his attempt to take the Co private  The BBY situation is clearly fluid  Shares are likely to remain susceptible to an ongoing deluge of data from BBY and its potential suitors  In the end  firm views a deal to purchase Best Buy as unlikely  Ample cash flow and a still healthy balance sheet suggest that BBY could support the added leverage associated with a leveraged buyout  LBO   OpCo believes  however  that potential private equity buyers will ultimately balk at a deteriorating business model that is increasingly falling victim to the inroads of new non traditional CE competitors and a weak product cycle     Provided by Briefing com    OK  let s actually look at what s going down with the options  Ultimately  it s the skew that caught my attention  but let s start with Charts Tab  six months   below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side we can see the decline from   28 in late March  to now in the  18 range  While the ride has been bumpy  BBY is down from  25 43 as of one year ago  or a  28 7  move  At one point in the last two years  BBY was trading near  45 a share  The 52 wk range in stock price is   16 25   27 89  On the vol side we can see a rather bumpy ride in the implied as well  Most notably however is the move today    a significant pop raising the vol to the 85th percentile  annual   The 52 wk range in IV30  is  29 46   73 33   Let s turn to the Skew Tab where we can see a phenomenally interesting term structure We can see that the  16 strike puts are all priced pretty similarly across the front three months  Then there s an awesome upside skew in the Sep options  a noteworthy but less abrupt upside skew in the Oct options and then a downward sloping upside skew in the Dec options Simply stated  the option market reflects substantially greater upside risk  potential  in Sep than Oct  and in Oct than in Dec  Extrapolating a bit of meaning into this  we might also say that the option market reflects the takeover   private decision   ordeal will be over by Dec expo As a definitive example of how much the skew shape has changed with the news headlines over the last two months  above   I ve included the Skew Tab from 7 2 2012  below We can see a parabolic shape to the Jul options and a vol diff that was beginning to open up between the OTM calls in each month  but the shape has changed considerably  Note how the OTM puts were still priced higher than the ATM options in both expiries back in early Jul and how that is clearly not the case right now  Very cool Let s turn to the Options Tab  for completeness We can see the monthly vols across the top are priced to 67 78   63 35  and 59 54   respectively for Sep  Oct and Dec  Looking more closely  we can see the vol diff between the Sep and Oct OTM calls  getting as large as 17 vol points in the Sep Oct 25 call spread  while the ATM vol diff is just five vol points  DISCLAIMER  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-08-30,Ophir

169011,390527,BBY,The IPO Quandry,opinion,While only a few have the luxury to debate whether it should file an IPO  it is a decision that should not be taken lightly  The monetary benefits come with numerous downsides such as constant analyst scrutiny  restrictive disclosure and governance  and an overall focus on short term financial results  Facebook  which had no need for the cash or extra distractions  is a recent example of a company that is probably second guessing its decision  If there are so many drawbacks  why are all the IPO worthy candidates going forward with it  Do these companies have other options besides a public equity offering    Firstly  thanks to the recent JOBS act  Facebook  to go public  It chose this route for probably the same reasons that other similarly situated companies do  Top talent  from Sandberg on down  were poached from other Valley successes with the promise of liquidity and Menlo Park real estate  The VC investors were silently pushing to pad their fund returns  Perhaps a little envy from the competition either going out or ballooning in market value weighed in  Let s face it  a  100B stock offering is hard to pass up in many ways  But as Fortune s Dan Primack eloquently put it  going public made  Many of the most successful companies in the world have paved their own way while staying out of the public limelight  Of the  companies  excluding state run and PE gone private deals   many  such as Ikea and Koch  are still owned and operated by the founding family  They have been able to maintain their culture  quality  and ultimate corporate mission while realizing growth comparable  or better  to publicly traded peers  Some  such as Cargill  have even tapped public debt markets while keeping their equity off limits  The  by Mars shows private companies  wherwithal to execute blockbuster deals  many public deals are cash debt anyway   While difficult to keep stakeholder interests aligned as private companies experience rapid growth  many have shown success in doing so   Some new trends may help companies stay private  Crowdfunding s torrid growth on the early stage end may help avoid VC mandated exits  For later stage companies  private exchanges such as SecondMarket are  platforms for individual stock transactions  in fact FB was valued more privately than it is today   I wonder if IPO tepid companies like Google would have delayed or cancelled IPOs if these markets were well established at that time  Private equity is still a traditional option but still requires to play by the five year exit time horizon rules  Debt instruments work for larger growth companies  but smaller ones either can t get it or require risky personal guarantees  And even if going public ended up being a mistake  the excess money on the sidelines creates opportunities for founders to buy back their company as Best Buy s Dick Schultze is currently attempting to do   The IPO is a logical exit for many companies who are looking for cash or easily tradeable currency  Trulia s  today shows that the end of the IPO is not happening anytime soon  Perhaps those that chose to take the long view for their companies will be less inclined feel less to do so thanks to recent debacles like FB or expensive Sarbanes Oxley requirements  Maybe the democratization of information and the availability of alternate market vehicles will bring required investor returns low enough to avoid the pressure of going public  Since the Silicon Valley techies hate the public markets so much  you would think their uber creativity would have brought some innovative alternatives  But then again  why would all the VC firms be on Sand Hill Road ,2012-09-23,Atma Business Blog,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-ipo-quandry-137308,137308
169012,390528,BBY,Best Buy  Option Market Reflects Potential Of Takeover Pre Earnings,opinion,Best Buy Co   Inc   BBY  is a multinational retailer of consumer electronics  computing and mobile phone products  entertainment products  appliances and related services  This is a vol note    specifically skew as earnings approach  Having said that  any note on BBY has to include at least an allusion to the goings on of a potential takeover   private by the ex Chairman  Here a list of headlines that I copied from a blog I posted on 8 29 2012 as well as a link to the article iself 06 Jul 12 15 23 ET  Best Buy to layoff 2400 employees   CNBC11 Jul 12 09 33 ET  HHGregg at a 3 5 year low following Q1 warning and FY13 guidance cut  now off  32   7 80  3 74   Update BBY  6 13 Jul 12 09 42 ET  Best Buy trading lower off the open  Hearing cautious comments at Cleveland Research30 Jul 12 08 44 ET  Best Buy spikes to  20 then comes back to   19 following renewed takeover reports 30 Jul 12 08 43 ET  Best Buy founder Schulze recruiting executive team for buyout   Bloomberg06 Aug 12 08 35 ET  Best Buy Founder Richard Schulze confirms proposal to acquire BBY for  24 00 to  26 00 per share    Provided by Briefing com    Clearly there s been more news    all we need is the equity market price to see that     17 50 is not  24  26  takeover price rumor    But  I want to focus on the Skew  so let s start there  The Skew tab from today is included below As far as I can tell  the next earnings release for BBY should be in late Nov  but likely after Nov expiry  What we can see in the skew is an abrupt upside vol in the OTM calls when compared to the other strikes in Nov and certainly the other strikes in Dec  I ve highlighted the vol diff that has opened to the upside The skew hasn t always looked like this  In fact  we can see the Skew Tab from 10 3 2012  below    and how this weird shape discrepancy was not apparent  The Dec options  green curve  laid above the Nov options  yellow curve  across all strikes    a reflection of the risk in earnings  It s the news over the last fifteen calendar days that has created this rather dramatic shift  Here are the headlines since 10 3 2012 10 3 2012  According to reports Best Buy  BBY  founder Richard Schulze and four private equity firms are preparing a possible  11 bln buyout of BBY 10 9 2012  Best Buy announces it is conduction a search for a new CFO10 10 2012  Best Buy founder Richard Schulze has made progress toward making a bid for BBY  according to reports10 12 2012  Best Buy is planning on matching online competitor  AMZN  prices this holiday season    according to the WSJ10 16 2012  Best Buy  Reuters reporting BBY is planning to price its own Android tablet  insignia flex  at  239 to  259    Source  Briefing com  So new technology  a competitive move against Amazon  AMZN  and more of the takeover  stuff     all in a relatively short period of time  The result is    that shift in skew  Let s skip the Charts Tab this time  and just go straight to the Options Tab  We can see the vols across the top  specifically that Dec is priced to 62 84   while Nov is priced to 58 81   So  it does seem that the option market reflects that the vol event  earnings  is due out in Dec  and not Nov  But  looking at specific strikes  checkout the Nov Dec 20 call spread  as one example     where owning the earnings month costs  63  vol while selling to pay for it with Nov sells  68  vol  There are several of these spreads as well as diagonals to the upside  where owning Dec  and earnings  is less expensive  in terms of vol  than owning Nov Of course  the takeover news  or possibility of it  is a non trivial risk factor which the option market reflects quite clearly  It is interesting to note that the case is not reflected in the downside options  OTM puts   if we look back to the Skew Tab from today  In English  the options reflect greater upside risk  potential  in Nov vs Dec  and earnings  but not to the downside  Hmmm    Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-10-19,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-buy:-option-market-reflects-potential-of-takeover-pre-earnings-140408,140408
169013,390529,BBY, Retail Sales  You Can t Blame Sandy,opinion,The release of the retail sales report for October missed estimates coming in at  0 3  versus last month s upwardly revised 1 3  bump  Immediately  the media went to blaming Hurricane Sandy for the impact  There are two problems with this excuse  First  Hurricane Sandy didn t hit the East Coast until October 29 after the majority of retail sales data was already collected  and secondly  it is more likely that Sandy actually boosted retail sales in the Northeast as individuals stocked up on supplies  and made preparations  prior to impact  The majority of the impact from Sandy will come in November However  even if we go with  Sandy impacted retail sales  argument    the Hurricane excuse doesn t really justify that the gross gain in retail sales nationwide over the last year was only  20 42 billion  not seasonally adjusted   Of the  20 42 billion in sales the major category percentage contribution is shown in the table Importantly  over the past year the bulk of retail sales have come from Motor Vehicle sales as sub prime auto loans have made a vast resurgence and nearly as much simply went into the gas tank  Non store retailers also comprised a large chunk of consumer dollars as more shoppers gravitated toward the internet leaving companies like Best Buy  BBY  gasping for air However  while consumers did spend money over the past 12 months  it has been a slowing rate of growth since June of 2011  This decline in the annual growth rate of sales is troubling As we stated last time  For the average American the impact of rising inflationary pressures due to higher food  energy and gasoline costs are being exacerbated by stagnant or declining incomes  The shortfall between incomes and the family budget has to be filled in with credit  The problem with that  of course  is that if incomes don t eventually start to pick up the default risk of extended credit increases The month over month data  especially when seasonal adjustment factors are included  can skew the data in the very short term  However  the economy  and the underlying earnings of the companies within the economy  is impacted more by the quarterly and annualized changes in the data  It is from those longer term views that hiring  expansion and production decisions are being made  Unfortunately  the trends of the data from manufacturing  production and sales do not bode well for the coming quarters ahead The chart below shows the annual percentage change between average hourly earnings and retail sales The impact of rising food and energy costs requires consumers to pay MORE for the SAME amount purchased  While increases in price  such as gasoline at the pump  shows up in retail sales reports as an increase in sales    it is only an increase in the dollar value of product sold and not necessarily in the quantity  For the average consumer this is what  inflation  looks like as wages decline and costs increase  For businesses that make products    it is the QUANTITY sold that matters  When there is no relative increase in demand in units sold    there is no incentive to increase employment or production The rate of change in retail sales is also a critical component in monitoring current state of the economy  Recently  we have seen weakness in industrial production and real incomes which have given us concerns about the strength and sustainability of economic growth  With sales now coming under pressure it is highly likely that we will see weakness in future employment  As my friend  As of the latest data  the growth is excruciatingly weak  and some might see some early signs of rolling over  Industrial Production and Real Income are off their 2012 highs  and Nonfarm Employment growth has been frustratingly slow  Real Retail Sales  the most volatile of the four  is the only one exhibiting strong growth over the past three months  But in the last few months we ve seen a bit of disconnect between personal income and retail sales  That is not a sustainable decoupling History tells us the brief periods of contraction are not uncommon  as we can see in this big picture since 1959  the same chart as the one above  but showing the average of the four rather than the individual indicators The important point is that with incomes under pressure  food and energy costs rising  and businesses being impacted by a recession in Europe combined with an inability to pass along cost increases to consumers    the economy is set to continue grinding along at a very sub par growth rate  For investors    corporate earnings are being impacted as demand slows  rising input costs cannot be passed along and cost cutting measures have primarily been exhausted  This leads to concerns about the validity of exhuberant forward earnings expectations and current market valuations The next two months will tell us much about the state of the real consumer as we analyze the holiday sales trends  With personal savings rates already on the decline    the percentage of total retail sales that fall onto the family credit card will be of particular interest  With consumer debt now back at record levels  as incomes struggle  one has to wonder just how long it will be before the next shoe drops ,2012-11-14,Lance

169039,390555,BBY,4 Companies That Could Be Acquired Very Soon,opinion,Earlier this week  I looked at a range of commodity stocks that look quite attractive in relation to the value of their assets    I focused on Freeport McMoran  NYSE  FCX  as a clear example of a stock that looks quite appealing in the context of its balance sheet  if not its income statement    Yet other investors are focusing on Freeport McMoran for an entirely different reason  A recent article on Bloomberg com  that a major mining firm such as Rio Tinto  NYSE  RIO  could take advantage of share price weakness and make a move to acquire the copper and gold miner    The article quickly reminded me of a lesson I learned from a mentor nearly 20 years ago   Never ever pursue a stock simply on the basis of a buyout rumor   He correctly noted that few rumored deals actually come to pass    Since then  I ve added my own addendum to his dictum  If a stock is reasonably priced or downright inexpensive    even after buyout rumors have circulated    then you could look at the potential deal as another catalyst for the stock    In that context  Freeport McMoran is already quite attractive on its own merits  and a bid from Rio or BHP Billiton  NYSE  BHP  would just get you to your eventual target price that much more quickly  The fact that Freeport McMoran s stock has risen only modestly since the story ran only reinforces the notion that you are not chasing someone else s  pump and dump  scheme    Of course  there are many examples where investors foolishly chase a stock ever higher on buyout rumors  only to get burned when those rumors die down  This happened recently with drugstore chain Rite Aid  NYSE  RAD   Shares moved up from a  1 to  1 50 this past winter on improving results  To most analysts   1 50 looked like fair value  So when the stock shot past  2 on buyout rumors  the stock suddenly became very risky  Indeed  that kind of move often means it s a good time to sell  Right now  the rumor mill is churning with talk of a merger between Kroger  NYSE  KR  and Safeway  NYSE  SWY   Analysts at BMO took a deep look at the logic behind such rumors  and came away impressed  Their key conclusion  the combined entity would reap considerable synergies  so a deal could be priced that provides 30  to 40  upside for shareholders of both grocers   Kroger would likely be the surviving entity  so Safeway s upside would come sooner and Kroger s would come later   The buying power that a combined platform could muster with suppliers would finally match up with the purchasing strength that has propelled Wal Mart  NYSE  WMT  to overpower the grocery space    More to the point  if the merger doesn t happen  then both of these stocks still look reasonably valued on a standalone basis  Each stock trades for less than 10 times projected 2013 profits  This isn t an endorsement of these stocks  but a framework through which you can look at them    Yet investors should note that Safeway reports earnings on Thursday  April 26  and the results are likely to be mediocre at best due to some near term headwinds  It may pay to wait until after the news is digested to play the merger and acquisition  M A  angle on this stock   All that cash    looking for a home  Frankly  it s fairly surprising how little buyout activity we ve seen in recent quarters  The ever rising cash balances at many companies  the low cost of borrowing and the need to find growth opportunities in this tepid economy should be fueling a furious bout of deal making  Private equity firms  with more than  400 billion in cash could also be looking at breaking out their checkbooks  according to Goldman Sachs  Though it hasn t been much in evidence yet  I remain convinced that robust M A activity will turn out to be one of the key investing themes when 2012 comes to a close    So what other companies could be in play  Well  the key is to focus on companies that are already so cheap based on their current cash flow  that they would both appeal to potential acquirers and have solid downside support in terms of valuation    in case a deal never happened    In play yet again    but this time  with downside support  Unfortunately  this means companies that are deeply out of favor should be the focus  Take Radio Shack  NYSE  RSH  as an example  Its stock has slumped from  20 in late 2010 to a recent  6 on a string of weak quarterly results  Indeed  you can probably assume that the electronics retailer will disappoint investors yet again when quarterly results are released this Tuesday  April 24    But here s the rub  this stock has fallen so sharp  that a financial or strategic buyer could offer a 50  premium and still pay a low price for this company  RadioShack has generated an average of  150 million in annual free cash flow    on average    during the past eight years  The company is now valued at just  600 million  and its fairly strong balance sheet  with  592 million in gross cash  is precisely the kind of weapon that private equity firms like to target    RadioShack was the subject of buyout rumors when its stock was at  20    and investors got burned  Now  with shares off 70   those rumors are back  though this time the downside risk in the stock seems much lower  Again  it s foolish to own a stock like this in hopes of a buyout  but the dowdy valuation means it s already a bargain on the fundamentals   Could this be the next big energy deal   Investors may also seek continued M A in the energy sector  especially as natural gas focused firms are short of funds to exploit their assets  As an example  Chesapeake Energy  NYSE  CHK  is scrambling to raise cash to meet its 2012 capital spending plans  and fears of balance sheet troubles have pushed this stock below  20 for the first time since 2009   Behind the scenes dealings by CEO Aubrey McClendon that have raised conflict of interest concerns have also pressured shares     Chesapeake is now worth less than  12 billion  Note that Exxon Mobil  NYSE  XOM  paid more than  40 billion to acquire XTO Energy in 2010  and Chesapeake s current energy assets are even more extensive than XTO s were  To be sure  natural gas prices are now much lower  but strategic investors such as ExxonMobil know this won t last and may well conclude that Chesapeake is too much of a bargain to pass up    Risks to Consider  Companies such as RadioShack  Chesapeake Energy  Best Buy  NYSE  BBY   Nokia  NYSE  NOK  and many others have made a series of missteps to find themselves in the bargain bin  and further missteps can t be ruled out  That s why you must stress test a company in terms of its downside support      It s wisest to focus on quality companies that are simply out of favor such as

169043,390559,BBY,Retail  Is It Different This Time ,opinion,Many large  recognizable retailers are trading as if their business models are dead  For example  among others  Staples  NASDAQ SPLS   Best Buy  NYSE BBY   and Office Depot  NYSE ODP  all trade at P E s under 10  in some cases  quite a bit under   while the 45 year old RadioShack  NYSE RSH  sells for barely more than its net current assets  Investors appear to have abandoned ship on the fear that Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is going to take all of these guys  and others  under  I m much more pessimistic about our ability to make such predictions  First  we re just not that good at making predictions  especially about the future  I have discussed anecdotal evidence repeatedly but more importantly  the statistical record  It s why governments do a poor job picking successful industries  and it s part of the reason why countries that rely on free market capitalism have higher standards of living than those with central planning  Back to the subject at hand  it s also why value screens and things like the magic formula work  since we are so bad at predicting  you d do much better than average just by buying what s cheap  Second  even if we can predict which companies are stronger and which are at risk  how do we know how the economics of the situation will play out  There are no patents in this industry  which allows everyone to copy whatever works  For example  a company with purchasing power like Best Buy can offer more goods online than it does in stores  matching Amazon  and in store pickup  besting Amazon   while a company with local economies of scale like Staples can offer same day delivery  besting Amazon    As more sales go online  the cost of retail space may fall  allowing bricks and mortar retailers to pass on the pain to retail landlords  Already  we see lease rates have fallen  For example  appliance and electronics retailer hhgregg has been profitably increasing its store count and raving about the economics of the lease rates it is currently able to pick up  in large part thanks to the exit of Circuit City   At the same time  Best Buy sees a 20  IRR on its small format stores  suggesting RadioShack s problems are more internal  i e  they can be fixed  vs external  At the same time  Amazon has been enjoying a sales tax advantage over its bricks and mortar brethren  But it increasingly looks as if that advantage may be going away  Many states are in the process of implementing sales taxes on goods purchased online  which would put the retailers back on a level playing field  We also have to be wary of falling prey to The Halo Effect  the term  and title of the book  used by Phil Rosenzweig in describing business delusions  When share prices fall  investors and the media tend to see the negatives far more than they do the positives  But why is a company like Staples more likely to crumble in the face of the Amazon threat today than  say  two years ago when its share price was double what it is today   Hint  It isn t  We re just more scared now because its price is lower  but when sentiment is negative and prices are lower is precisely when you are better compensated for taking on risk   Finally  for those of you who think bricks and mortar is dead  consider Amazon s next step  The company is apparently opening its first store soon  Clearly  even Amazon thinks there s a future in bricks and mortar  Don t get me wrong  I m not saying these and other retailers don t face challenges  But they ve faced challenges before  There have been unemployment crises  consumer leverage crises  terrorist crises  tech bubble financing for competitors and other challenges all in the last 15 years  All of these have required changes to business models to better suit customer needs  we re hard pressed to know whether these changes will improve or hurt each of these businesses  performance in the long term  As such  we may be better off accepting that we just can t predict what will happen  and therefore we would probably do well to buy these companies when they are very cheap Disclosure  Author owns a few retailers ,2012-07-17,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail:-is-it-different-this-time-129872,129872

169045,390561,BBY,2 Big Box Electronic Stores  2 Different Strategies,opinion,Electronics retailers are at a crossroads  The flagship products they made so much money on in the last decade  namely flat screen tvs  are no longer as lucrative as they once were  Consider how differently these companies are choosing to react to the new environments they are facing  In business  change is constant  Customer requirements change over time  as do supplier capabilities  Competition attacks from different angles  and regulations alter the environment  In electronics retail  consider how the merchandise of RadioShack has evolved over time in response to varying degrees of the above factors  The company s storied history  allowing for mergers that have taken place over the years  first involved selling leather shoe parts and CB radios through mail order catalogues  If it were in any of these businesses today  it would be cooked  So every now and then  the company has had to evolve to continue to provide customers with what they want  Consumer items such as radios  tvs  PCs and others have all gone through different phases of popularity  leaving question marks in their wake as to where future profitability may lie  Is today any different  There are many reasons why flat screen TVs are not as lucrative as they once were  For one thing  almost everybody has one now  so demand is fairly mature  For another  the housing market is weak  and the number of sales of new units is likely linked to housing sales  Also  consumers just haven t fallen in love with 3D capabilities or smart TVs as much as they did with flatscreens   This brings us to the supply side  where manufacturers built overcapacity as they mis read demand  This has caused pricing pressure on the entire supply chain  reducing the profitability of the units the stores do sell   So where do the retailers go from here   There is one area of consumer electronics that has shown remarkable strength  smartphones and tablets  To be sure  each of these retailers has jumped on this bandwagon  but the economics of these products just aren t as favourable as they were for TVs  Gross margins are lower  likely on account of supplier power  namely  Apple   form factor  allowing for competition that doesn t need big box space  and price   In response  Best Buy has decided to go with a smaller footprint  It is reducing its square footage  and opening smaller stores that can still sell these smaller products  but at lower cost  In this way  the company is looking to take advantage of its distribution scale and brand name   The company s founder who has expressed interest in buying the company  however  may have an entirely different strategy   hhgregg  on the other hand  is looking to add merchandise to fill up the space left vacant by its tv department  In the next month  the company will be testing out furniture and fitness equipment in select showrooms  In this way  the company is looking to take advantage of its large stores and its delivery scale   Which strategy will prove more effective  It s not possible to determine  Both strategies can work  and both may  It s important to note  however  that there are barriers to entry in each of the regions in which these companies operate  thanks to the scale these companies have built over time  For this reason  don t be surprised if they manage to be profitable despite how the market is discounting their stock prices  At some point down the line  consumers may be enamoured by a completely different product  A new TV  3D  perhaps   solar power panels  who knows  Until such time  we ll get a chance to see which of these companies fares better in the current challenging environment  It should be interesting ,2012-08-10,Saj Karsan,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-big-box-electronic-stores,-2-different-strategies-132627",132627
169046,390562,BBY,Nasdaq Biotech ETF   IBB  Now Set Up For Pullback Trade Entry,opinion,Since August 9  the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund ETF   IBB  has been on the ETF trading watchlist of The Wagner Daily trading newsletter as a potential pullback trade entry  Though it has not yet traded through our preset trigger price for buy entry  it formed a bullish hammer candlestick pattern yesterday  which could lead to upside follow through in today s session  Further  it  undercut   briefly dipped below  near term support of its 20 day exponential moving average  as well as the low of its six day trading range  This is illustrated on the daily chart pattern of IBB below  When an ETF  undercuts  a key moving average  as  IBB did yesterday  this serves to sweep poorly placed stops and shake the  weak hands  out of the trade  This has the effect of absorbing overhead supply  thereby clearing the way for the equity to move higher  When a bullish reversal candle forms after a stock or ETF has  undercut  a key level of support  we refer to this type of buy entry as a pullback entry  which is one of the preset technical scans on our new technical ETF and stock screener   Pullback entries develop when an ETF or stock gently retraces from the most recent  swing high  of its uptrend and finds technical support at an area of horizontal price support and or a key moving average  After this happens  it is important to wait for the ETF to form a  pivot   which allows for a relatively low risk pullback entry for swing trading  The best buy pivots tend to occur when an ETF or stock forms a bullish reversal candles  such as a  hammer   that sharply undercut a key support level on an intraday basis  but subsequently recovers to close near the high of the day  When this occurs  our trigger for buy entry of at least partial share size is simply above the high of the reversal candle  Because of the combined  undercut  with reveral candle that  IBB formed yesterday  subscribers to The Wagner Daily should note in today s ETF trading watchlist section of the newsletter that we have lowered our exact trigger price for buy entry of this trade setup  Although the Nasdaq  S P 500  and Dow Jones Industrial Average technically remain in their nearly week long sideways consolidation patterns  yesterday was the second consecutive day that the broad market rallied late in the day to close near session highs  This type of price action is considered bullish  and suggests that market bulls are buying into weakness  The main thing missing has been the presence of institutional participation  but if volume suddenly comes back into the market  stocks could easily break out above the highs of their holding patterns and resume the rally attempt that began two weeks ago ,2012-08-14,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nasdaq-biotech-etf-($ibb)-now-set-up-for-pullback-trade-entry-132869,132869
169067,390583,BBY,S P 500  All Systems Go On the Follow Through,opinion,T2108 Status  62 VIX Status  14 3 General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold with a bullish biasReference Charts  click for view of last 6 months from Stockcharts com  Commentary So much for wiping out the gains from the S P 500 s big breakout on March 13th  In   I gave the bearish case its due just for the sake of completeness  That case is now far in the rearview mirror for now  Yesterday  the S P 500 printed an important confirmation and follow through to the current bullish trend  With T2108 still below overbought levels at 62   the major index is still  all systems go  Incredibly  a LOT has happened in just two trading days  I will summarize the T2108 related action by describing the trades I made and their rationale and or context  Bought FXP  ProShares UltraShort FTSE Xinhua China 25 ETF  shares In the last T2108 update  I put FXI  an ETF of 25 large cap Chinese stocks  on my bearish list given a new 2 month low  I bought FXP  the inverse of FXI  While this position naturally moved against me today  I realized that FXP is a great hedge given it seems China may likely produce the next source of market angst  If so  FXP should deliver some cushion against the blow  FXI remains below its 200DMA Missed doubling down on more SSO weekly callsOnce again  I failed to get aggressive enough even as I believe I am shaking all lingering bearish doubts from my trading finger  I lowballed my offer despite the calls losing as much as 33  of their value at Friday s lows  The chart below shows how little time I had to decide to accumulate  If I had managed to execute  those calls would have delivered about a 120  gain when I decided to sell my SSO calls into Monday s open  Instead  I gathered a 58  gain on the first tranche of SSO calls  I did decide to hold onto my April SSO calls  As a reminder  my strong bullish bias has the short term horizon of a swing trader  1 to 3 days   so weekly calls typically serve my purpose as a cheaper way to buy the dips  The longer dated SSO calls are added firepower against the SDS hedge The S P 500 makes a sharp turn after Thursday s dip at the openClosed out BBY  catch up play  For more information on this trade and my analysis of the coming earnings play in BBY see    Ended the torture of holding VXX shares Nothing has been more destructive to my performance than VXX shares  I finally gave myself MAJOR relief by unloading them on Friday  I simply could not trade VXX puts fast enough to keep up with VXX s losses  I replaced the shares with April calls that I am holding as  just in case  we wake up one morning to something truly crazy  I suspect there are still way too many bears that are doubling and tripling down on VXX waiting for just that magical  Black swan  moment  I married the calls to even more puts  the better risk reward bet for now  Those puts soared in value at Monday s open as VXX quickly fell another 6  to fresh all time lows  I happily sold them  VXX ended the day down over 9   This thing got so ugly  I decided near the close to apply some of my profits from the March weekly puts into buying out of the money April puts  VXX s chart exclaims 1000 words and death by 2000 cuts The VXX deathmarchBack into the euro plays with Siemens  SI The euro plays get me the most excited right now  They are more in my contrarian comfort zone whereas the bullish plays on the S P 500 are all about trend following  With Europe rallying overnight  I checked in on Siemens  SI  to see how far it had popped  To my surprise  Siemens was flat  For comparison  EWG  the Germany ETF  closed the day up a cool 2 2   SI is still directly below critical resistance so I am taking a larger risk than usual  but I feel it is worth the shot with EWG looking ready to launch to fresh 8 month highs  I consider Siemens a classic  catch up  stock as it will be a natural play for anyone wanting to participate in a European recovery  I started with calls  If Siemens manages to drop below  90 or so  I will begin accumulating shares to hold for the longer haul What now With the S P 500 at fresh multi year highs  it seems crazy to maintain such a bullish bias  yet  the data told me to do it  While I suspect tomorrow s open will make me wish I still had all my SSO calls and original collection of VXX puts  I will stay focused on the current strategy of buying whatever dips the market presents and then selling into the next rally  I continue to expect a lot of churn with a slight upward bias that produces numerous bullish trading opportunities  including shifts in and out of overbought territory  Last week s dip was a PERFECT example of what I talked about earlier as part of my expectations  the continued frustration of bears as selling lacks the critical follow through to break down the S P 500  This week s open printed an exclamation point as the S P 500 recaptured ALL of last week s losses in a flash  That impressive move occurred on decent  meaning average  trading volume  This follow through and fresh breakout must thus be respected and given its due When T2108 next hits overbought territory  I hope to re examine the data supporting the bullish case  Until then  stay nimble and keep an open mind Charts below are the latest snapshots of T2108  and the S P 500  Refresh browser if the charts are the same

169069,390585,BBY,Blighted Retail Sector Contradicts  Recovery  Claims,opinion,With Friday s late breaking rally  the broad averages finished the week with their best first quarter performance ever  Supposedly  it was upbeat data on consumer spending that helped push the rally into the record books  But if consumers are actually starting to loosen up   using credit  of course  since household incomes have been stagnant  the evidence is nowhere to be seen  The nation s retail landscape in fact remains blighted with boarded up stores and gangrenous malls  Last week  Best Buy  BBY  became a candidate for the death watch list with the announcement that it plans to close 50 stores and lay off 400 workers as part of a plan to save  800 million in recurring costs  The consumer electronics giant also plans to move away from the big box format that helped put so many competitors out of business  Now Best Buy is itself the victim of an even bigger player  Amazon  AMZN   which  with free shipping and no sales tax  can meet or beat any price Best Buy can offer  How are you going to compete with that Answer  You can t  And that means that the closing of 50 of Best Buy s 1100 stores could be the beginning of the end  just as it was for Borders and Blockbuster when they began to shrink to compete more efficiently with  respectively  Amazon and Netflix  NFLX   Best Buy s retrenchment will not be welcome news for commercial real estate developers  who have yet to recover from an unending stream of big box closures  including Comp USA  Borders  The Great Indoors  Circuit City and Linens  n Things  to name some of the more recent ones  Their bankruptcies have glutted the market with more space than could be absorbed in a decade   and that s assuming there are new businesses ready to move in that can pay the rent on showrooms the size of football fields  That s not to say there are no new tenants to be found  only that there s a limit to the number of physical fitness centers  grocery stores and discount retailers that can step into the void  In the meantime  there are reasons to think that the growth in commercial vacancies will quicken rather than slow  One retailer alone  Sears  SHLD   which has been in a death spiral for more than a decade  is going to blow a huge hole in the rental picture when the company finally goes down  probably within the next two years  And on Main Street  there will be yet more vacancies when independent movie theatres that have somehow survived until now close because they can t afford the  65 000 per screen digital conversion needed to stay in business after Hollywood stops shipping celluloid prints at the end of 2013 Considering that America s GDP is 70  consumption based  we are mystified by all of this talk recently about a supposed recovery in household spending  Yes  we re aware that each new 10 cent increase in the price of gasoline is trumpeted by the government s sleazy  mendacious spinmeisters as an increase in sales  And the restaurant business  at least here in Boulder CO  is booming so strongly that one might think no one eats at home any more  But it beggars belief to suggest that such factors are leading the nation back to prosperity  Not that America s middle class is likely buying any of it  With retirement dreams fading fast  home prices still falling  health care costs soaring beyond affordability and grocery prices inflating at a scandalous rate  probably few outside of Wall Street and the newsrooms believe there is any recovery at all  Do you ,2012-04-02,Rick Ackerman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/blighted-retail-sector-contradicts-‘recovery’-claims-118847,118847

169091,390607,BBY,hhgregg  Back in Value Territory,opinion,Shares of hhgregg  HGG  fell off a cliff last week after the company reported preliminary numbers from its all important holiday quarter that were below expectations  But is the company really only worth two thirds of what it was worth last month  It appears likely that hhgregg s price fluctuates to a far greater extent than its actual value  which could provide an opportunity for value investors This is actually not the first time hhgregg has been discussed on this site  hhgregg traded in this price range about 6 months ago  and was thus highlighted here  The stock then saw huge gains as positive sentiment returned  as discussed here  It now trades at a P E of less than 10 despite strong returns on capital and significant revenue growth The biggest risk to this industry is of course competition from online retailers  Bricks and mortar retailers like Best Buy and hhgregg are having to compete with web retailers like Amazon who appear to care a whole lot about market share  and not a whole lot about margins  This dynamic has hurt the profits of everyone this year  as the battle for market share is on  But there are a few reasons to believe the threat is a little bit overblown in the long term First  there is a large customer segment that prefers to shop in stores  This is seen by the strong returns on capital companies like Best Buy and hhgregg still generate  even though web retailing is not new  Even with hhgregg s recently reduced earnings guidance  the company will earn an ROE of about 14  this year Even when customers shop online  however  the retail presence still plays an important role  Best Buy reports that 40  of those who order online choose to pick up the item in store rather than wait for delivery This highlights an important aspect of the competitive relationship between Amazon and bricks and mortar retailers  When Amazon innovates  the bricks and mortar retailers can choose to copy  But Amazon cannot copy the innovations of the bricks and mortar companies that involve physical stores  As such  with competent management  bricks and mortar retailers should not only be able to survive  but also thrive On that subject  hhgregg has a proven management team that has successfully guided the company while it has gone up against some tough competition for the last several years  The directors and executive officers of hhgregg own more than  200 million of the company as well  which serves to align their interests with those of shareholders Finally  hhgregg has grown and generated its strong returns despite sales tax advantages web retailers have enjoyed in most US jurisdictions  This advantage has finally caught the eye of lawmakers  who are now starting to clamp down on Amazon  This will serve to level the playing field between the bricks and mortars and the web retailers Just because a stock is cheap doesn t mean it won t go down more  But for long term shareholders who don t mind the sometimes violent price swings in this stock  hhgregg could turn out to be a rewarding investment   again ,2012-01-17,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hhgregg:-back-in-value-territory-111416,111416

169093,390609,BBY,A Successful Change in Strategy,opinion,T2108 Status  63 VIX Status  14 5 General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold with a bullish bias  more details below Commentary For the third day in a row  T2108 closed at 63  The rapid drop from overbought levels has not  yet   preceded a similarly dramatic correction  In the meantime  the retooling of the T2108 portfolio got off to a tremendous start this week   much better than I could have expected As a reminder   after a brief 6 day rest from the previous historic overbought period  The data suggest this is a time to get or stay bullish and NOT to expect an imminent  massive correction  The path higher should be fraught with churn and frequent jumps in and out of overbought territory  With this as a backdrop  I have left a near  full  position of SDS and a small position of VXX  that I never should have held  in the T2108 portfolio as a hedge for the aggressively bullish bias I am carrying forward from here  I launched my first  trial balloons  with call options and shares in Caterpillar  CAT  and call options on CSX Corporation  CSX   After I wrote that strategy  I also decided to load up on SSO calls  SSO is the ProShares Ultra S P 500 ETF  CAT was a disappointment as it experienced minimal follow through for the rest of the week  Call options I bought expired worthless  but I am still holding a small number of shares  On Friday  I reloaded with some April calls  I bought the SSO calls a bit too early and had to wait out a 50  drop in value on March 14th  I did not have the presence of mind to double down on my bet  next time I will  The S P 500 rallied again on Thursday  March 15th and delivered a 50  net gain that I quickly locked in  Those March  58 calls were expiring the next day  and it did not make sense to press my luck any further  The CSX calls were the truly big winners CSX was NOT in a bullish technical position at the time I selected it for a trade except that it looked like a critical support  should  hold  Instead  CSX is what I am calling a  catch up  stock during this bullish phase for T2108  CSX remains well off its highs and likely looks cheap relative to a recovering economy  Catch up stocks have some company specific issue preventing a full recovery valuation  Anyone feeling left behind by the rally will give catch up stocks a hard look given the apparent upside potential once the market decides to look past the issues  For CSX  sagging coal prices are dragging on the company s performance even as all the economic signals the company sees remain strong  I gathered this interpretation after scanning the transcript of CSX earnings looking for insights on natural gas prices  see    for more   On March 14th  I felt like I made a terrible mistake  CSX sold off on high volume and broke its lows from March 13th even as the S P 500 closed relatively flat for the day  That sell off brought CSX ever closer to a disastrous break of critical support  Unlike the SSO calls  I bought April calls expecting CSX to take its time meandering back up to 50DMA resistance  so doubling down was not even close on the radar here  Incredibly  the next day  CSX soared 8 5   Turns out that CSX made  where the company reiterated its bullish guidance  Combined with a timely reiteration of an overweight rating and buyers got all the excuse they needed to play catch up with CSX  Here is what Barclays said  from briefing com  emphasis mine    Barclays says weak coal demand is challenging the earnings outlook for the eastern U S  rails  CSX and NSC  The market has been quick to respond  sending both companies  shares materially lower  but they expect a slow coal recovery will remain an overhang for several quarters  As mentioned earlier the firm downgraded NSC to Equal Weight as a result  On the other hand  solid pricing fundamentals and relatively stable western coal dynamics create a bright outlook for UNP  As mentioned earlier the firm upgraded UNP to Overweight  Although CSX also faces coal headwinds  they believe a lower valuation and forecast cost reductions this year provide some buffer for shareholders  firm reits their Overweight rating on CSX   Note well  the market received NO NEW INFORMATION  What happened was a simple reminder that CSX is cheap in a bullish environment and a recovering economy  CSX just happened to deliver the strongest example of a catch up play that I could imagine    CSX continued to rally on Friday  again on high volume  CSX punched above its 200DMA and now looks a LOT more bullish  I almost locked in a double on CSX  but if I had held on through Friday  I would have achieved a triple  CSX plays catch up and finishes right on top of 200DMA resistanceIn case you were doubting that the bullish winds are once again behind the market  review the chart of the S P 500 below  The index is now tagging the upper Bollinger Band  BB  and looks ready for a second phase of its rally in what technicians sometimes call  walking the band   This occurs during strong trends whether up or down  Oscillators classically fail during these periods and cannot provide any new information  The S P 500 smashed through the upper BB as our first bullish signal  It has yet to close below the the upper BB  For context  the S P 500 has only tagged the upper BB one other time during this entire multi month rally  This occurred on February 3rd right at resistance from the July  2011 secondary high  The one day correction on March 6th ended right around this level  In other words  the S P 500 has  incredibly  delivered one of its more bullish signals yet  It should be respected  Oh  and did I mention that buyers stepped up AGAIN  Buying volume surged  granted  Friday was a major options expiration day  Now  before you think I am getting carried away with all this bullish talk with the S P 500 already up 11  or so for the year  I will reiterate that I am still not a stock chaser  Even in this bullish mode  I strongly prefer catch up stocks to breakout stocks  For stocks in strong uptrends  I am looking for dips  as shallow as they may be  to lower my downside risk and to increase my assumed upside opportunity  Trades outside of my 2012 focus of housing  commodities  and insider buys will largely be swing trades  short term on the order of days  not weeks   Finally  given the hedge of SDS and VXX  I will tend to be very aggressive with call buying on SSO on the dips  I will prefer call options for now because they give me an automatic stop loss which I consider a very important attribute with the stock market so well extended to the upside I close with these baffling stats demonstrating that retail investors are still walking away from the stock market and embracing bonds  In     CNBC provides the latest remarkable stats on investor flight from stocks without definitively identifying whose buying keeps lifting stocks  Virtually every metric offered to gauge investor behavior is showing money draining out of the market and insiders skeptical about the future  Stock based mutual funds have lost  1 2 billion since the start of February even though those same funds have returned 9 8 percent in 2012  Moreover  bond mutual funds have pulled in at least  6 billion for six weeks running  totaling  29 6 billion in the past four weeks  which was 11 8 times as much the  2 5 billion into all equity funds  Finally  and perhaps most damning  corporate insiders are dumping their holdings in droves  selling  6 8 billion in February  the most in 11 months and 13 times the level of insider buying  which is way above the norm of 8 6 times   Moreover   Thomson Reuters has found companies issuing negative earnings preannouncements outweighing those issuing positive ones by a 3 to 1 margin  the highest since the crisis days of 2009  and  analysts have cut their  buy  ratings on each of the  S P 500  s 10 sectors during the course of the year   Incredibly  a good chunk of the money leaving stocks has apparently piled into ONE ETF  VXX  the iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN       the assets entrusted to the iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures exchange traded note  VXX  has increased by  746 million  or 94   this year  to  1 54 billion  This is a fund that increases in value along with the price of implied market volatility  known more colloquially as disaster insurance  So  about three quarters as much net cash has found its way to a fund that profits from spikes in U S  market volatility as has been sent to funds that attempt to profit from rising equity market values   No matter what we make of this investor flight and negativity  it is clear that the resulting selling remains too weak to take the market down significantly  The few buyers that are out there are obviously sufficient to keep any dips shallow  I dare not guess what will change this strange dynamic  but while it lasts  I will remain focused on constructing trading strategies that fit the occasion  Next up  Best Buy  BBY  as my next catch up stock  Charts below are the latest snapshots of T2108  and the S P 500  Refresh browser if the charts

169094,390610,BBY,Storm Clouds Gather As Earning Season Set To Start,opinion,Storm clouds gather over U S  and global stock marketsAs the First Quarter draws to a close  storm clouds gather on both fundamental and technical levels as we look ahead to the Second Quarter  Earnings reports  economic reports  seasonal factors and technical indicators cast a long shadow over the outlook going forward On My Wall Street RadarIn the chart above of the S P 500  NYSEARCA SPY  we can see that the point and figure methodology has issued an alert   long tail up   which indicates overbought markets and the likelihood of a correction ahead  You can see how the long column of Xs has climbed without interruption  and a pullback correction to the 1300 level would not be unexpected within the context of an ongoing bull market Other technical factors at play include continuing overbought conditions  declining breadth and advance decline lines and declining momentum as the major indexes stall at long term resistance  Divergences like this oftentimes lead to measurable declines and we expect sideways to lower prices ahead over the short to medium term The Dow Jones Industrial Average  NYSEARCA DIA  is drifting back towards the psychologically important support level of 13 000 and short term momentum has turned negative The Nasdaq 100  NYSEARCA QQQ  remains in nosebleed overbought territory with an RSI reading of 74  declining momentum and stochastic on a  sell  signal from overbought levels The Russell 2000  NYSEARCA IWM  has declined to significant support after failing at near term resistance The all important financial sector  NYSEARCA XLF  has been a market out performer year to date and now also finds itself overbought and with declining momentum heading into the end of the first quarter The Economic View From 35 000 FeetFundamentalfactors also point to storm clouds ahead as earning season is about to start and early indications are less than stellar  reports that earnings growth rate is set to decline for 1Q  the first such decline since Q3  2009  with seven of ten sectors pointing south  while profit warnings run 3 1 ahead of positive forecasts  Furthermore  without Apple s  AAPL  earnings included in the mix  S P 500 earnings growth would show a decline of 1 6  Furthermore  Europe is entering a recession  China is in a major economic slowdown  along with the rest of the emerging world  and with approximately 50  of S P 500 earnings coming from overseas  we can expect increasing headwinds for earnings heading into Q2 Seasonality will also start to come into play as the well established and widely watched  sell in May and go away   factor is on the horizon  the period from May to October when the stock market tends to deliver sub standard or negative returns The economic news last week favored the negative side of the ledger as the positive side saw jobless claims fell to their lowest levels in four years  the Greek crisis abated with the successful resolution of its credit default swaps payout and leading indicators rose to beat expectations On the negative side  a European recession is a near certainty as the IMF forecasts GDP contraction of  0 2  for the region and China is making a marked slowdown with its PMI dropping into contraction territory  French and German manufacturing contracted and U S housing starts and home sales for February fell and missed analysts  expectations while gasoline prices continued to rise This coming week brings a stream of economic data including consumer confidence  durable goods  weekly unemployment  Thursday is a big day with the Q4 GDP estimate and Friday brings consumer spending  sentiment and Chicago PMI which will be widely watched and compared to recent news from Europe and China  We ll also see the start of earnings season with reports from Lennar  LEN  in the home building sector  and Best Buy  BBY  in the all important retail sector What It All Means for Stock and ETF InvestorsWhat it all means is that a global economic slowdown seems to be forming while technical indicators continue flashing red  Offsets to the negatives are the ongoing support efforts from the Federal Reserve and European Central Banks  However  major forces like seasonality and overbought conditions  along with declining earnings  tilt the risk reward balance towards increasing risk and declining rewards over the short to intermediate term Disclaimer  Wall Street Sector Selector actively trades a wide range of exchange traded funds  ETFs  and positions can change at any time ,2012-03-26,John Nyaradi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/storm-clouds-gather-as-earning-season-set-to-start-118138,118138
169115,390631,BBY,Identifying Insider Buying,opinion,There is evidence to believe that insiders do beat the market  But how does one find out what insiders are up to  That s what this post is about The quick and easy way is to use an aggregator like Yahoo  Finance or Insider Cow  which compile this data and make it readable  For example  this page shows you the insider transactions of Best Buy But sites like Yahoo  often get things wrong  and in this way they can lead you astray  Therefore  the most surefire way of getting accurate info is to read the insider filings yourself  For that  you ll need to navigate to the SEC website s Company Search page There  you will be asked for your search parameters  Pay attention to the field titled  Ownership Forms 3  4  and 5   By default  this will be set to  exclude   but these are the forms you want to see if you re interested in insider transactions  Select the  include  button before hitting  search  As an example  consider the insider filings of Taitron Components  available here Opening the Form 4 s  we see that both the Chairman and CEO have been adding to their positions in recent days weeks  Last time they did this was in July of 2010  subsequent to which the stock rose some 50  over the following few months Of course  Taitron  or any other stock  is not undervalued just because insiders are interested  But this information does arm you with the knowledge of what management may think about the stock ,2011-12-13,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/identifying-insider-buying-108558,108558
169116,390632,BBY,No Santa Rally This Year,opinion,As predicted on Dec 7th  that Euro is heading 1 29 and now it s at 1 30 level  With weakening Euro and strengthening US dollar  means Emerging countries are less likely to buy anything from US and with business inventories up  US doesn t have to buy new things  Fed did the right thing by not issuing QE3  Neither QE1 or QE2 has helped and neither will QE50 help  The issue is growth and credit market tightening  Banks are not issuing news loans to small business as banks need to maintain certain levels of liquidity as per regulatory requirement so that another Lehman brother doesn t happen  But this is slowing the global growth  The Global economy is heading downhill from here on  The market was up in the morning in positive territory inspite of bad US economic data  It is holiday season  the retail sales number should have gone up and business inventories should had gone down but the result showed opposite  which is bad sign for US economy and the holiday season  Inspite of record sales thanksgiving  Best buy was down by 15  and Amazon was down by 5    After 800 point rally  I think there is no Santa rally this year  It s more likely to fall from here  and we could see worst in February 2012   If you think Euro is going up from here then short AUO and buy FXE  and if you are bullish then buy AUO and short FXE  Buy ERY  FAZ  VXX  TZA if you are bearish and buy ERX  FAS  and TNA if you are bullish  GLD and IAU is a sign fear and inflation  Inflation is going down but if the oil prices rise then inflation will come into picture again then its safe to buy GLD and IAU  At this level I would still recommend to buy GLD and IAU and hold it long  Overall I think there could be some resistance and some hope from Thursday s ECB meeting  There is no doubt market is looking clues to go higher because the hedge fund managers are under performing and they need year end bonus too  so they want to keep the market high but don t get trapped by this  Keep cash in hand there is plenty of opportunity in this market and you can easily make good fortune  Just don t lose money  Remember if Nasdaq is in negative territory then its bear market and be bull or bear accordingly ,2011-12-14,Vinay Jha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-santa-rally-this-year-108671,108671
169117,390633,BBY,Euro Lower as Markets Focus on Bond Auctions in Germany and Italy,opinion,The Euro is trading at 11 month lows  even testing 1 30 at one stage  ahead of key regional event risks that will be seen with the Treasury bond auctions in both Germany and Italy   These auctions have been cited as one of the main gauges of market sentiment in recent months  and today s sales will be valued at roughly 8 billion Euros in tandem   Any significant rallies in bond yields will weigh on equity markets and bring more buying into the US Dollar   Other negative headlines have centered on comments that the German Chancellor  Merkel  aims to keep the current EFSF limits in place  with no increases past the current 500 billion Euro limit Today s macro data out of the UK will be primarily employment related  with Jobless Claims  Claimant Counts  and the ILO Unemployment Rate all scheduled for release   Regional earnings reports will be sent from Supergroup  Thomas Cook RWS Holdings and Betfair Group   FTSE 100 futures are pointed to a lower open  mirroring losses seen in Asia  after yesterday s disappointing Federal Reserve meeting  which indicated no new quantitative easing stimulus  despite a mostly negative policy statement   Most regional equities turned lower after the Fed decision after seeing moderate relief rallies earlier in the day The economic calendar in the US is relatively bare today  with only the Import Price Index  IPI  and the MBA Mortgage Applications scheduled for release   Earnings reports are also limited  with only second tier companies on tap but this was not the case yesterday  as both Amazon and Best Buy showed sharp declines in the aftermarket session after posting weaker than expected third quarter retail sales   These releases were ominous because they are matching what is being seen the government Retail Sales data   The monthly figures are actually showing a slowdown in consumer activity despite the strong numbers that were seen on Black Friday In Europe  both the DAX and CAC are pointed toward lower opens but we will see some regional macro data that could help support prices   First  we will see Industrial Production figures out of the Eurozone and this will be followed by PPI  Import Prices and the ZEW survey out of Switzerland The Swiss data could actually prove to be the most market moving of the bunch as any easing in Producer Prices will lead more analysts to speculate the SNB will use their next monetary policy meeting as an opportunity to raise the price floor in the EUR CHF   If this revaluation does come to be  this is probably where most of this week s volatility will be seen as the result could be as much as a 700 pip change from current levels The EUR USD has broken some highly significant long term historical levels in this latest move downward  so here we will scale out to the weekly charts to get a better idea of what to expect next   Yesterday s key break came as prices probed support at 1 3140  reaching new yearly lows in the 1 30 region   Besides being a critical psychological area  this is also the 61 8  retracement of the mid 2010 rally from below 1 20  so any follow through here will confirm that the downtrend is alive and well The FTSE is starting to show some weakness as prices roll over from resistance at 5630   We have very clear downtrend lines on both the daily and hourly charts  so we will need to see a break of 5630 before we can expect the downtrend to reverse   First support comes at the Fibonacci level at 5410 ,2011-12-14,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/euro-lower-as-markets-focus-on-bond-auctions-in-germany-and-italy-108752,108752
169118,390634,BBY,Best Buy Price vs Value,opinion,Shares of Best Buy  BBY  fell more than 15  yesterday after the company reported its 3rd quarter results  It s pretty strange that a company can lose so much of its value on the basis of one quarter  as the company came up 4 cents short on analyst EPS estimates  But it s even more strange for a company like Best Buy  which makes most of its annual profits in the 4th quarter  as per the chart below   which means the 3rd quarter profit result doesn t tell you a whole lot about the business  long term prospects On an annual basis  Best Buy has shown remarkably consistent returns on invested capital  as illustrated here So yesterday  it s likely that the company s price fell much more than did its value  if its value fell at all   Such divergences between price and value can give long term investors the opportunity to profit After yesterday s price dive  Best Buy trades for just over  8 billion  even though it has a net cash position and earns about  1 3 billion annually  Furthermore  in just the last five years  Best Buy has returned  6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks  Management has been clear that buybacks will continue as long as the share price remains depressed Best Buy s price is indeed volatile  as any 5 year price chart will show you  As shown by its returns on capital  however  Best Buy s value is remarkably stable  Long term investors can profit by buying when pessimism reigns and selling when optimism returns ,2011-12-14,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-buy-price-vs-value-108757,108757
