2  Canopy Growth Corporation  CGC

NUAN   and Dorian LPG Ltd    NYSE LPG   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Breakout Stocks Generating Exceptional ReturnsPicking breakout stocks is probably one of the most popular techniques used by active investors  The logic behind this kind of stock selection is to determine stocks that are trading within a narrow channel  Such stocks are to be purchased as soon as they move above this band and are sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum and offers the promise of considerably high returns Spotting Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those which have just breached this level Verifying Whether It s for RealStocks which have breached their resistance level should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is whether they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week

131386,352901,NUAN,Nuance Communications  NUAN  Is Oversold  Can It Recover ,opinion,"Nuance Communications  Inc    NASDAQ NUAN   has been on a bit of a cold streak lately  but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock  And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at NUAN given that  according to its RSI reading of 20 69  it is now in oversold territory 
What is RSI 
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet  NUAN s low RSI value isn t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround  as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late  This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Nuance Communications  earnings consensus

131414,352929,NUAN,Software Industry In Technology Sector Shows Improving Breadth,opinion,In the weekend post I mentioned that due to the strong market breadth I would be looking for long candidates for the short term trades  The Software industry in the Technology sector is showing improving breadth and the Dow Jones US Software Index  DJUSSW  is outperforming the Technology Sector SPDR  XLK  in January  The screening process has given several candidates in this industry for a long trade After reviewing charts I opened a partial long position in Nuance Communications  NUAN  today  But before going to the trade let me give you a sample how I analyse P F charts deciding if it is an appropriate candidate for a particular trade NUAN is a candidate for a short term long trade  Though I am planning a short term trade  I want to be sure that the longer term trend is in alignment with my short term directional trade Here is the medium term 0 3x3 60 min chart  This is the 3 box reversal chart and the box size is volatility adjusted  We see that in July the price made an attempt to reverse the medium term downtrend at the same time establishing and activating the bullish vertical count with a target at 25 8 from the June low  The first attempt failed but the price was stopped short from the June low indicating the weakening bearish pressure The second attempt to break through the Bearish Resistance line in August was successful and the price reached the price objective from the June low precisely  After that the bears intercepted a ball again and tried to resume the downtrend  The bearish vertical count from the September high gives 19 5 as a price target  All they could do  however  was a higher low in November  Reaching the bullish target and a failure to reach the bearish count target shows a gradual shift from weakening supply to strengthening demand  In January the price broke out above the descending Bearish Resistance line again  A new buy signal at 23 1  lime box  validated this breakout  Actually  if you look a little bit left  you see two failed bearish attempts  two columns of Os  to break below support at 21 6 in December  In both cases the bulls responded with a higher column of Xs and a new buy signal  thus re asserting themselves  This kind of the price action has strong bullish implications  The vertical bullish count from the November low points to 27 3 and the price is currently battling against the resistance zone at 23 4 23 7  So  the medium term chart is bullish  but to be sure that we don t miss anything let s take a look at the 1 box reversal chart I d like to note here that 1 box and 3 box charts are two completely different methods of charting with different construction principles and  therefore  different interpretation  Both contain information that may not be visible otherwise  So  it is useful to look at both of them analyzing the price action  A 1 box reversal chart by construction has a higher frequency of changing columns and  therefore  has a shorter term horizon than a 3 box reversal chart  On the NUAN 0 3x1 60 min chart we see that the price formed a reversal fulcrum bottom in November and broke out from it generating a full catapult buy signal at 22 5  lime box   Though  the price broke through the internal subjective bearish resistance  thin red line   the main subjective Bearish Resistance line was not broken decisively and the target from the horizontal bullish count at 23 1 from the November bottom was not achieved  So  at that time it would be wise to let the price show its intentions before taking the medium term long trades  The price went sideways in December and later issued a semi catapult buy signal at 23 1 confirming the reversal  Note that the new buy signal coincides with the previous bullish price target  We can now draw the subjective Bullish Support line  blue  and count a new price objective from the December congestion area Here are a couple words about horizontal counts on 1 box charts  There are 4 different methods to count price targets from congestion areas on 1 box charts  All of them are valid  It s a matter of preferences  On this particular chart I used the row with the most filled boxes in a congestion area as a count row  The December congestion pattern gives 24 9 as a bullish price target It s worth mentioning that until we have a breakout column from a congestion area and a new buy or sell signal on a 1 box chart  we can t say whether a developing count is bullish or bearish  Thus an analyst keeps two potential counts on an unfolding sideways pattern and removes one of them when the direction is clear  You see that there are two counts on the narrow congestion pattern which is unfolding in January  Taking into account the previous bullish character of the price action odds are high that this pattern will break upward but until it happens we keep bullish and bearish counts  As you already realized  the height of a count is proportional to the width of a pattern  So  the bullish target at 25 2  as well as bearish  from the January congestion is not the final one and can be changed if the price continues its sideways trend  The main conclusion from this chart is that the price is in the confirmed medium term uptrend and the nearest bullish price targets reside in the 25 area  The price objectives from horizontal counts on 1 box charts are closer than on 3 box charts  due to construction differences  and new counts appear more often We can extract more information from the medium term charts but for the short term trade what we got is enough  It s time to switch to the short term charts This is the short term 0 15x3 30 min chart  The time horizon of this chart is a bit shorter than the previous one  We see that the price is moving upward within a pretty compact trend channel  There is a continuation Symmetrical Triangle pattern right under the Bearish Resistance line  The up thrusting column of Xs from this Triangle generated a new buy signal  lime box  which confirmed the trend reversal  The bullish vertical count from the November low points to 25 05  the same area where targets from congestion zones on the 1 box medium term chart reside  It underscores the significance of the 25 area  When the price moves closer to the upper and lower trend channel boundaries it signals about overbought or oversold conditions  In this case  based on the character of the current short term uptrend  we can expect a retracement or resuming of upward movement And finally the short term 0 15x1 30 min chart  Here we can see details of the January congestion pattern  Visually  it looks like a Symmetrical Triangle   a continuation pattern  We can see that the rows with the most filled boxes in this pattern are located closer to the downside  It means that the most action occurs at the bottom of the pattern   the sign of accumulation  The horizontal count gives 25 50 on the upside and 20 70 on the downside  remember  horizontal counts give bullish and bearish counts until there is a clear breakout   The pattern is in process of formation and the counts are not final  In addition  if we assume that it is a continuation triangle than the following move should be equal to the move before the pattern  I highlighted the entering column of 12 Xs in blue  Adding it to the potential breakout point at 23 25 gives the target at 25 05  The 25 target zone looks more and more important Today  when the price moved to the lower boundary of trend channel on the short term 3 box chart I opened a partial long position in NUAN 11 00 AM Bought to open NUAN Feb13 22 Call 5 contracts at  1 59 The partial long position was open because the price was declining and a possibility existed that the rising trend channel could be broken on the downside  At the same time the risk was well defined and contained  A break below the lower boundary would trigger a Triple Bottom sell signal on the short term chart and lead to the position closing  I may add to the position on a new buy signal I don t know if this trade will be a winner or loser  I just wanted to share with you in this post what kind of analysis I perform on P F charts before entering a trade  P F charts help to analyse the pure price action and can be a very powerful tool in a trader s arsenal  Disclaimer  I
