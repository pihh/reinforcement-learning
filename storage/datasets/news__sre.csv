 Reuters    U S  power company  Sempra Energy   N SRE  is near an agreement to sell its Chilean business to State Grid Corporation of China for close to  3 billion  the latest deal in its bid to shed non core assets  people familiar with the matter said on Friday 
Sempra has been seeking to bolster its finances and increase its appeal to investors after a wave of wildfires in California exposed it and other utilities to more legal liabilities  It also came under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp and investment firm Bluescape Group to scale back its global operations 
Sempra s deal with State Grid Corporation of China could be announced as early as next week  the sources said  cautioning it was still possible that negotiations may falter at the last minute and asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential 
Sempra declined to comment  while State Grid Corporation of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
China  whose booming economy over the past two decades has driven up demand for South America s raw materials  has been investing more in Chile as it seeks to secure resources 
Chile  among Latin America s most open economies and the world s top copper exporter  has sought to remain neutral amid the growing trade tensions between China and the United States  promoting instead the need for open markets 
Sempra said in January it would wind down its South American businesses  Last month  it announced it would sell its Peruvian businesses to a unit of China Yangtze Power Co for  3 6 billion  as it focuses on its core U S  and Mexican markets 
Elliott has now exited its investment in Sempra  according to its latest quarterly regulatory filing 
Sempra s Chilean businesses include Chilquinta Energ a SA  the third largest distributor of electricity in the country  and Tecnored SA  which provides construction services to Chilquinta 
State Grid Corporation of China beat out a number of other bidders  Italian utility  Enel   MI ENEI  had said in June it had made a bid for both the Chilean and Peruvian businesses

122808,344323,SRE,A Million Californians to Start Going Dark in Another Blackout,news," Bloomberg     Hundreds of thousands of Californians will start going dark Wednesday afternoon as part of a mass blackout that utilities are carrying out to keep their power lines from sparking wildfires 
PG E Corp  will start shutting off power to 179 000 homes and businesses in 17 northern and central California counties starting around 2 p m  local time  Further south  Edison International s Southern  NYSE SO  California utility said it s considering a similar shutoff that may affect 162 276 customers  and  Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE  is weighing cuts to 24 000  In all  more than 1 million people could be affected 
The situation was listed as critical across the state Wednesday with dry winds set to  ramp up considerably   according to the U S  Storm Prediction Center in Norman  Oklahoma  Thursday will be worse across Southern California where the risk is  extreme   And while winds will likely die down this weekend  the situation could be repeated next week  especially in Northern California 
 The most volatile period for rapid wildfire growth spread will be the first half  of Thursday  the agency said in a statement 
Early next week  the winds are expected to restrengthen after a relatively mundane weekend as a new front rushes in  according to Bob Oravec  a senior branch forecaster at the U S  Weather Prediction Center in College Park  Maryland
 The threat is going to be there   Oravec said 
The threat of widespread shutoffs is hitting just two weeks after PG E carried out the biggest planned blackout in California history  plunging about 2 million people into darkness  knocking out traffic lights and forcing businesses to shut across the Bay Area  Southern California Edison also cut power to customers  though on a much smaller scale 
The blackout threat has spurred a debat between California Governor Gavin Newsom and the utility  In a letter to Newsom last week  PG E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson said California should discuss the idea of a state agency deciding when to carry out widespread shutoffs  Late Tuesday  Newsom shot down the idea    saying transferring control of the decision making would be a  bailout  for PG E 
The PG E blackout that struck earlier this month drew outrage from residents and state officials who accused the utility of cutting service to more customers than necessary and failing to properly communicate its plans  The debate has played out as the state could face weeks of similar decisions  The wildfire season can last until the winter brings rain and moisture to the region 
Sempra Energy s San Diego Gas   Electric utility is warning nearly 24 000 customers could lose power in more remote areas 
PG E customers should be prepared this week to go dark for as long as 48 hours  Johnson has said  The utility will be looking at forecasts up to the  very minute  to try to limit the scope of this week s blackout  PG E s senior director of emergency preparedness  Mark Quinlan  said Tuesday 
 If there are opportunities to sectionalize and limit the impact to customers  that s what we re going to do   Quinlan said 
PG E  the state s biggest utility owner  was forced into bankruptcy after its equipment was identified as the cause of devastating blazes that included the Camp Fire in November 2018 that killed 86 people and destroyed an entire town  The company has been taking more extreme measures since those fires to keep its equipment from sparking more blazes ",2019-10-23,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/a-million-californians-to-start-going-dark-in-another-blackout-2002441,2002441

122811,344326,SRE,How Mexico s leftist president quietly made peace with big business,news,"By Dave Graham MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Barely a day goes by without Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador berating business and political elites  whom he blames for fueling the country s poverty and corruption  But behind the scenes  the leftist is proving more accommodating to Mexico s top tycoons during his first year in office than his language often suggests  Meeting regularly with Lopez Obrador  corporate bosses have steered him toward more business friendly policies  according to more than two dozen senior executives and government officials who spoke to Reuters  Quietly  they have also urged the president to soften some of his rhetoric  What some business heavyweights describe as an improving relationship yielded fruit in August  when Lopez Obrador backed off a threat to tear up several government contracts awarded to private companies to build and operate natural gas pipelines  The president said the deals ripped off taxpayers  But business leaders warned him the cancellations would spook foreign investors and could disrupt ongoing trade negotiations with the United States  the executives and officials said  They also told him the infrastructure would help deliver cheap energy to his top priority  Mexico s poorest   We used all means of persuasion   said Carlos Salazar  head of Mexico s top private sector association  the Business Coordinating Council  CCE   and one of the main mediators on the pipeline dispute  Elected in July 2018 as Mexico s first left wing president in over three decades  Lopez Obrador has promised to transform the country by putting the neediest first and slashing inequality  A firm believer in the reforming power of government  Lopez Obrador has pledged to strengthen Mexico s leading state run enterprises   oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos  Pemex  and power utility the Comision Federal de Electricidad  CFE   His clashes with institutions that check presidential power  from market regulators to the Supreme Court  have unsettled investors  So has his often incendiary rhetoric  He has described money as the  mother or father of the Devil  and pilloried  neo liberal  free market economics as the source of Mexico s woes hundreds of times  Still  he has acknowledged publicly that he cannot create jobs  spread wealth and realize his goal of 4  annual economic growth without private capital  Since his term began in December 2018  domestic investment has sagged and the economy has stalled  The private sector has been largely supportive in public  for fear of antagonizing the 66 year old president  But in private  many leading executives are still wary of his economic stewardship  said Andres Rozental  a business consultant and former deputy foreign minister   They re worried to death about what s going on   Rozental said   The uncertainty  the disincentivization of private sector involvement in the economy   Lopez Obrador says his approach will take time to deliver results  Responding to a question from Reuters  he described his relationship with Mexico s business leaders as  very good   but said some differences of opinion were inevitable    Policy has changed  and now they re adapting   he said  without elaborating  AIRPORT BLUES Five weeks before taking office  Lopez Obrador stunned investors by canceling a new Mexico City airport  ignoring a plea to keep it going by billionaire Carlos Slim  whose Grupo Carso SAB was a principal contractor  Lopez Obrador said the  13 billion project was geologically unsound and tainted by corruption  prosecutors have not charged anyone with wrongdoing  The cancellation hammered Mexican financial markets and angered top business groups  Grupo Carso declined to comment on his criticism of the project  Concerns flared again in late June when power utility CFE said it would renegotiate the seven pipeline contracts signed under the previous government  whose record was marred by graft allegations  The CFE said the  12 billion in contracts were too expensive and imposed harsh terms on the cash strapped company  As one of the contractors  Slim s Grupo Carso was once again in the firing line  So were Canada s TC Energy Corp  IEnova  a Mexican unit of U S  company  Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE   and Fermaca  a local gas pipeline operator owned by Swiss private equity firm Partners Group AG  Canada s ambassador complained  U S  lawmakers and business groups warned the dispute could jeopardize the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  the successor of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   which has yet to be approved by U S  or Canadian lawmakers  As talks between the pipeline firms and the CFE dragged on  CCE boss Salazar and Antonio del Valle  head of the Mexican Business Council  which represents the country s top magnates  held meetings with Lopez Obrador to break the impasse  Using a map  they explained how the new infrastructure   including a marine pipeline from Texas   would bring affordable gas to Mexico s underdeveloped south  according to a person familiar with the matter  Salazar and del Valle confirmed the map  In late August  Lopez Obrador announced the CFE had reached a deal with the companies that would realize savings for taxpayers and avoid a messy legal dispute  He thanked Salazar  del Valle and Slim for helping make it happen  Describing the pipeline accord as a  watershed   del Valle said the talks helped create a mechanism for Mexico s business leaders to address economic matters with the government   Now we have the opportunity to participate   he said  Others saw the pipeline settlement not as a breakthrough  but as an example of business leaders saving the president and his allies from their worst instincts   They have no idea how close they were to a nuclear disaster in terms of financial markets  in terms of trade talks   said one person involved in the pipeline negotiations   Lopez Obrador has publicly acknowledged the dispute risked souring investor confidence  but he said the previous contract terms were  damaging  to Mexico s interests      GOODBYE  FIFI  Another challenge emerged in late May  when U S  President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on all Mexican goods if Lopez Obrador did not curb a surge in migrants trying to cross the U S  border from Mexico  Within a week  Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard had struck a deal  Salazar and other executives accompanied him to Washington and helped defuse the crisis by working with U S  business allies who had fought to defend NAFTA from Trump in 2018  people familiar with the matter said  In the end  Trump called off the tariff threat after Mexico agreed to tighten its borders  That evening  Salazar told local media he had been part of a joint effort and urged business and government to tackle Mexico s problems together  Lopez Obrador publicly thanked Salazar for his efforts  After the U S  meetings  business leaders pressed the president to tone down his divisive language  particularly his use of the word  fifi   a derogatory term for privileged elites that some bosses found needlessly provocative  a senior executive told Reuters  Since then  Lopez Obrador has publicly said he wants to avoid the word  his use of it has dropped dramatically  Asked by Reuters if the change in tone was the result of pressure from corporate bosses  the president denied it

122848,344363,SRE,U S  Chamber of Commerce slams Mexican utility s pipeline arbitration move,news,"MEXICO CITY  Reuters    The U S  Chamber of Commerce on Monday criticized the Mexican state owned power utility CFE s filing with an international court to begin arbitration with several infrastructure companies over pipeline contracts  saying the move could undermine investor confidence 
The CFE  COMFEL UL  said last week it would aim to negotiate a  fairer  outcome to contract disputes with several companies through a mediation process overseen by the London Court of International Arbitration 
The infrastructure firms include Mexican companies Fermaca  Grupo Carso and IEnova  MX IENOVA   a subsidiary of U S  based  Sempra Energy   SRE   as well as Canada s TC Energy Corp  TO TRP  
The London arbitration court could not immediately be reached for comment 
The U S  Chamber of Commerce said in a statement on Monday that it was concerned by the move  stressing the importance of legal certainty to secure foreign investment 
 This action risks sending a negative signal to U S  and other international investors about the business and investment climate in Mexico   the group said   We therefore urge CFE and the Government of Mexico to reconsider this decision and to observe the president s pledge to honor the sanctity of existing contracts  
The group did not detail what action it wanted CFE to take 
CFE began talks with pipeline builder Fermaca on Monday as part of a push to negotiate independently with the companies  CFE spokesman Luis Bravo said 
 All the companies have agreed to talk about the contracts  Today we met with Fermaca to determine how to negotiate   CFE spokesman Luis Bravo said  The talks will take place in parallel to the process in international arbitration court  he added 
Fermaca could not be reached for comment 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pushed back against criticism of the arbitration request  saying the terms of the agreements were  abusive  toward the state 
The U S  chamber has repeatedly come to Mexico s defense during U S  President Donald Trump s administration  defending the North American Free Trade Agreement when Trump threatened to kill the deal and urging the United States to exempt Mexico and Canada from steel and aluminum tariffs

122849,344364,SRE,Recently departed Mexico finance minister says pipeline dispute pushed him to go,news,"MEXICO CITY  Reuters    A Mexican state owned power utility s move to seek arbitration over pipeline contracts was one of the final straws that pushed the country s former finance minister  Carlos Urzua  to resign from his post  Urzua said in an interview published Sunday 
The interview with Mexican magazine El Proceso marked Urzua s first public remarks since he announced his resignation with a scathing letter on Tuesday 
The departure of Urzua  known for his commitment to fiscal discipline and considered a moderate in the administration of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  shocked investors 
While Urzua declined to detail all the final reasons for his departure  a dispute at the electricity commission  the CFE  over pipeline contracts was one of them  he said 
The CFE said on Tuesday it was seeking to recover  899 million in payments and wanted to negotiate  fairer  terms for a number of pipeline contracts signed by Mexico s previous government  Lopez Obrador has questioned the contracts  arguing they are too costly 
 A senior official and I went to tell the president a few days ago that what the CFE is doing is not for the benefit of Mexico   said Urzua   We signed a contract and we must comply with it  
The companies involved include Canada s TC Energy  TO TRP  and IEnova  MX IENOVA   a unit of U S  based  Sempra Energy   N SRE   and the dispute has led to diplomatic friction with Canada 
Spokespersons for the president s office and finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Urzua added that he also opposed Lopez Obrador s decisions to cancel a partly built airport for the capital and to construct a new oil refinery 
 I would not have devoted so much money this year to projects that can not take off fast   Urzua said 
Lopez Obrador has attributed Urzua s departure to tensions with the presidential chief of staff  Alfonso Romo  Urzua confirmed he had been referring to Romo  a prominent Mexican businessman  when he mentioned conflicts of interest in his letter ",2019-07-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/recently-departed-mexico-finance-minister-says-pipeline-dispute-pushed-him-to-go-1923033,1923033
122850,344365,SRE,Tellurian Signs  7 5 Billion U S  LNG Pact With India s Petronet,news," Bloomberg     India s Petronet LNG Ltd  signed a  7 5 billion agreement to buy into Tellurian Inc s proposed liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana in what could potentially be one of the largest foreign investments in the U S  to ship shale gas abroad 
Petronet will spend  2 5 billion for an 18  equity stake in the  28 billion Driftwood LNG terminal    the largest outside holding so far in the project    and negotiate the purchase of 5 million tons of gas per year  The remainder of the total will come from debt  according to Tellurian Chief Executive Officer Meg Gentle 
The memorandum of understanding was announced Saturday  The companies plan to complete the accord by March 31  by which time Tellurian hopes to have signed up partners to enable it to proceed with the project  Shares of the company rose as much as 11  in pre market trading on Monday 
 We will sign the document sometime in the first quarter and we will have financing ready to close simultaneously  and then we will begin construction   Gentle said in a telephone interview   India is one of the fastest growth markets for LNG and should soon become the second largest LNG importer  
The deal  signed in Houston in the presence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi  underscores a record year for the LNG industry  with tens of billions of dollars worth of export projects given the green light  The surge of new supply from America s trove of shale gas has rendered the once premium fuel accessible for emerging markets such as India  currently the sixth largest buyer of U S  LNG 
 People should not be surprised this came   said Tellurian co founder Charif Souki  who also started America s largest LNG exporter Cheniere Energy Inc   The United States and India have a significant issue diametrically opposed  We have too much gas that we don t know what to do with and India needs greater gas  and 1 million tons a time is not going to solve the problem  
The Petronet deal  the largest by an Indian company in U S  LNG  comes days after the gas industry s all important Gastech conference and coincided with Modi s visit to Texas  The prime minister appeared at Houston s NRG Stadium with President Trump on Sunday to address a crowd of more than 50 000 Indian Americans 
 This deal will further help diversify India s energy supplies   said Lydia Powell  who runs the Centre for Resources Management at the New Delhi based Observer Research Foundation think tank   The U S  wants to displace Middle East supplies and India is a large market  
Petronet s investment is vying to be the largest by a foreign entity with one that  Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE  expects to finalize in Texas with Saudi Aramco 
Tellurian expects to finalize the last 4 million tons needed for Driftwood s first phase with one or two partners in the coming months  Gentle said  Petronet s share represents about  2 billion in annual fuel sales for the life of Driftwood  she said 
 It supports the drilling industry and the pipeline industry  and there is going to be an enormous amount of resources   Souki said ",2019-09-23,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/tellurian-signs-75-billion-us-lng-pact-with-indias-petronet-1983904,1983904

122885,344400,SRE,A PG E Bankruptcy Would Leave Power Giant in Turmoil for Years,news," Bloomberg     The lights would stay on if California utility giant PG E Corp  files for bankruptcy  But the company  its customers and investors would be set for years of uncertainty 
While utility bankruptcies are rare  they can result in anything from a healthy company to a breakup  with business units sold off like spare parts  For consumers  the fallout likely means higher rates 
PG E plunged Monday on news that it s exploring a bankruptcy filing in response to an onslaught of wildfire liabilities that are estimated to be as high as  30 billion    far exceeding the company s roughly  10 billion market value  The potential move is seen as putting pressure on California lawmakers to provide a bailout and avoid more turmoil for the state s largest utility 
Whatever the outcome  bankruptcy tends to be  massively inefficient   said Severin Borenstein  an energy economist at the University of California  Berkeley 
 It freezes the company   he said   A judge who has no expertise essentially becomes the CEO  And there are these committees that get involved in every corporate decision  
PG E has been here before 
The San Francisco based company s Pacific Gas and Electric utility filed for bankruptcy in 2001 as soaring wholesale power prices and rolling blackouts threw California into crisis  The PG E Corp  holding company itself never filed for bankruptcy  The utility emerged three years later  its business intact  Under the reorganization plan  ratepayers were responsible for  7 2 billion of the company s debt from the electricity crisis 
Rare Occurrences
Bankruptcy filings tend to be rare for electric utilities because they have large and steady revenue streams  But there have been other cases  El Paso Electric  for example  filed for Chapter 11 in 1992  due largely to expenses tied to the Palo Verde nuclear plant  The Texas company exited bankruptcy court four years later with a new rate plan that let it recoup its costs 
Not every bankrupt utility has fared as well 
Last year  Energy Future Holdings Corp  was forced to sell off its electricity distribution business in Texas to  Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE  as part of a tortuous four year bankruptcy proceeding  And the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority  which filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to mounting debts  now plans to hire a private operator to manage its electricity grid 
The Puerto Rico utility s corporate disarray left it ill prepared when Hurricane Maria slammed into the island in 2017    something California leaders would have to weigh in a PG E bankruptcy as they face the prospect of another fire season with a power company in dire financial straits 
Different Issues
PG E hasn t commented publicly on the prospect of bankruptcy and didn t have immediate comment for this story  While the company does have experience navigating the Chapter 11 process  the problems it faces now are far different from those in 2001 
Then  unscrupulous energy traders and companies    most notably  Enron Corp     exploited flaws in California s recently restructured electricity market to send wholesale power prices soaring  Utilities  their rates regulated by the state  couldn t pass those cost increases on to their customers  At the time of the filing  PG E s debts were reported to be rising by  300 million per month 
This time  PG E s travails are tied to the role its power lines may have played in fires that killed dozens of people  In California  utilities can be held liable for damages even if they aren t found to be negligent 
State investigators have blamed PG E s equipment for starting 17 of the wildfires that tore across Northern California in October 2017  Those investigators are now exploring whether a PG E transmission line started November s Camp Fire  which leveled the Butte County town of Paradise and left 86 people dead 
Political Pressure
California politicians have been considering legislation that would help PG E pay off lawsuits related to the Camp Fire  and one veteran lawmaker has publicly questioned whether the company was using the specter of bankruptcy to pressure Sacramento  In 2001  Pacific Gas and Electric filed for bankruptcy while bailout talks with then Governor Gray Davis were well underway  Davis  blindsided by the filing  called it a  slap in the face to California   according to local reports at the time

Washington s goal of reducing Europe s dependence on Russian gas  Last year  Trump used trade negotiations to pressure the European Union to buy more U S  gas  But with the exception of Poland and Lithuania  which have linked their purchases of LNG explicitly to national security  market forces are the biggest factor in sales  In December and January  the Dutch gas price  which is used as a benchmark for LNG delivered to continental Europe  had been at the highest level since the winter of 2013 2014 at around  7 7 per million British thermal units  MmBtu   compared to previous winter

122889,344404,SRE,Trump to nominate ex energy lobbyist Bernhardt to head Interior,news,"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump said on Monday he would nominate David Bernhardt  a former energy lobbyist  to be secretary of the interior  the department that oversees U S  public lands  Bernhardt  currently the acting secretary at the Interior Department  is widely expected to continue pushing the Trump administration s plan to boost domestic fossil fuels production by opening more U S  public lands to drilling and mining   David has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived  and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed   Trump said on Twitter   Bernhardt would replace Ryan Zinke  who was under a cloud of ethics investigations and announced his resignation in December   The Interior Department  which employs more than 70 000 people and oversees more than 20 percent of the U S  land surface  has been central to Trump s  energy dominance  policy of boosting energy production  As Zinke s deputy  Bernhardt has played a role in efforts to open Alaska s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling  ease Obama era protections on a bird called the greater sage grouse to boost drilling and mining across the West  and open federal lands to leases for coal mining  Ann Navaro  a former Department of Interior official who served in the Obama and Trump administrations and worked closely with Bernhardt  said he is a rare  lawyer s lawyer  who prepares thoroughly for meetings  often being the only one in a room to have read full environmental assessments of projects and plans   Bernhardt  who prefers conservative suits to Zinke s cowboy hats and boots  also worked a series of jobs at the Interior Department under former President George W  Bush from 2001 to early 2009  including as the department s solicitor   After working under Bush  Bernhardt became a lawyer and lobbyist at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck for water and oil interests  He represented  Noble Energy  Inc  NYSE NBL    Rosemont Copper Co   Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE    and California s Westlands Water District  among others   CONFLICT OF INTEREST Bernhardt has long been an advocate of reforming the Endangered Species Act  the law that protects plants and animals at risk from resource extraction and development  If he is approved by the Senate  Bernhardt is expected to continue that work  Critics say Bernhardt s previous work as a lobbyist could risk conflicts of interest  unless he recuses himself from certain issues  because he worked for companies that could benefit by opening up lands to development  About 150 environmental groups in 2017  including the business friendly Natural Resources Defense Council  urged senators to oppose Bernhardt in the confirmation vote for his deputy position  saying his previous lobbyist work raised questions about his ability to act in the public interest  Despite their letter calling him a  walking conflict of interest   the Senate confirmed Bernhardt 53 43  on a mostly party line vote  and with strong support from Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski and other lawmakers who have large areas of U S  lands in their states  
If Bernhardt ascends to secretary  it would mirror the change of guard at the Environmental Protection Agency where last July Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler  a former coal lobbyist  replaced Scott Pruitt  who stepped down after a series of probes into his conduct  Wheeler is a staunch proponent of Trump s energy dominance agenda to produce oil  gas and coal for both domestic use and export ",2019-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-says-he-will-nominate-bernhardt-for-secretary-of-interior-1768792,1768792

South Korean President Moon Jae in said the joint drills  called Ulchi Freedom Guardian  were purely defensive and did not aim to raise tensions on the peninsula  though Pyongyang suggested that the military maneuvers are  reckless behavior driving the situation into the uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war  
In a day with no major economic reports  ongoing uncertainty over the economic agenda of President Trump and doubts that the Federal Reserve will deliver a third rate hike this year have fed into recent dollar weakness 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was down about 0 4  to 93 03 by 11 57AM ET  15 57GMT   near a more than one week low of 92 92 hit earlier in the day 
Investors were looking ahead to the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium where the heads of the U S  and European central banks will be making keynote speeches 
Though Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi are widely expected not to rock the boat by offering new insight into their respective paths of monetary policy in their speeches set for Friday  market players will pay close attention for any hints from the sidelines

Two months ago  Berkshire Hathaway made a deal to purchase Oncor after Texas regulators blocked two previous attempts by Energy Future Holdings to sell it 
Berkshire Hathaway had swooped in two months ago to buy Oncor after Texas regulators blocked two previous attempts by Energy Future to sell it  Bankrupt Energy Future Holdings chose Sempra s bid for a few reasons  because it was for more money  and also because Sempra Energy offered assurances that it could get the acquisition approved by Public Utility Commission of Texas and the U S  bankruptcy judge 
In addition  the decision could have been influenced by the fact that Energy Future Holdings received a great deal of opposition from its largest Creditor  Elliott Management Corp   over the potential sale to Berkshire Hathaway

123039,344554,SRE,Top 5 things to know in the market on Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  August 21 
1  War games start on Korean peninsula
U S  and South Korean forces began their annual military exercise  which will involve computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear capable North Korea 
About 17 500 U S  troops and 50 000 South Korean troops are involved in the exercises  which will last for about 10 days 
The joint military drills come on the back of a ramp up in geopolitical tensions earlier this month after a heated exchange of rhetoric between President Donald Trump and Pyongyang 
South Korean President Moon Jae in said the joint drills  called Ulchi Freedom Guardian  were purely defensive and did not aim to raise tensions on the peninsula 
Pyongyang warned that the upcoming exercises are  reckless behavior driving the situation into the uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war  
The hermit state followed last year s drills by launching missiles and carrying out its fifth nuclear test 
2  Global stocks slide as renewed U S  North Korea tensions sap risk
Global stock markets started the week on the back foot  holding near a five and a half week low  as tensions between the U S  and North Korea came back in focus 
Stock markets across Asia ended mostly in negative territory  with benchmarks in Tokyo  Seoul and Sydney falling amid thin trading volumes 
In Europe  shares were lower in mid morning trade  with almost all sectors and major bourses in the red 
Meanwhile  U S  stock futures pointed to a lower open on Wall Street  with the major benchmarks down between 0 2  and 0 3  
3  Dollar remains on the defensive amid U S  political turmoil
The dollar edged higher  but remained on the defensive following a White House focused week that raised more questions about the Trump administration s ability to implement its pro growth agenda 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was up about 0 1  to 93 45 in early trade  not far from Friday s low of 93 25 
Investors started to look ahead to this week s annual meeting of top central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole  Wyoming  where the heads of the U S  and European central banks will be making keynote speeches 
4  Oil starts the week on back foot amid U S  production jitters
Oil prices drifted lower to start the week as concern over rising production in the U S  dampened sentiment 
U S  crude was about 0 2  lower at  48 55 a barrel  while global benchmark Brent slipped 0 5  to  52 48 
Data from the U S  Energy Information Administration showed last week that total domestic crude production edged up by 79 000 barrels a day to 9 5 million barrels  its highest level since July 2015 
That comes despite data showing that U S  energy firms cut rigs drilling for new oil for a second week in three 
5  Maersk sells oil unit to  Total  for  7 5B as M A heats up
Shipping giant Maersk  CO MAERSKb  saw shares jump 5  in Europe after the firm agreed to sell its oil and gas division  Maersk Oil  to French oil major Total  PA TOTF  in a deal valued at around  7 5 billion 
Under the terms of the deal  Maersk will get  4 95 billion in Total shares and Total will assume  2 5 billion of Maersk Oil s debt 
The world s biggest shipping company said the sale will allow it to focus on its core transport and logistics units 
For Total  the deal is expected to boost its earnings and cash flow  and bolster its dividend prospects  Total shares dipped 0 5  lower

123099,344614,SRE,Exclusive  California gas leak spotlights shoddy regulation of aging storage wells,news,"By Nichola Groom  Reuters    Long before a natural gas storage well sprung a disastrous leak near Los Angeles  California  utilities and national industry groups were raising alarms about the danger of aging underground storage infrastructure   The leaking well s owner  Southern California Gas Co  warned state utility regulators in 2014 of  major failures  without a rate hike to pay for comprehensive inspections of 229 storage wells   Twenty six of its wells were  high risk  and should be abandoned   even though they complied with state regulations  the utility wrote in a rate filing  The previous year  Pacific Gas   Electric pointed to an absence of safety standards for storage wells as reason to launch its own monitoring program that went beyond state rules  according to an internal document obtained by Reuters   The industry s rising concern underscores the scant oversight of 400 underground natural gas storage facilities in 30 U S  states  Most storage fields are regulated by states  but national industry groups have pushed for federal oversight   unusual in an industry better known for fighting regulation  Jurisdiction over facilities storing gas to be transported across state lines falls to the U S  Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  But the agency has never written rules for gas storage despite two decades of sporadic calls for regulation   and at least two deadly explosions   Agency spokeswoman Artealia Gilliard declined comment on the agency s hands off posture   Under state oil and gas regulations  Southern California Gas faces a maximum penalty of  25 000 for the leak near Los Angeles  which is unprecedented in scale  The well has spewed methane   a potent greenhouse gas   since October and displaced thousands of people in nearby Porter Ranch   A bill introduced Tuesday by State Senator Fran Pavley calls for penalties of up to  25 000 per day for active leaks  It would also require the installation of automatic shutoff systems on all wells and continuous monitoring of wells within 10 000 feet of homes and schools  Utilities and regulators have been  gambling  with wells that in many cases were drilled in the 1950s  Pavley said  She described their standard practice as   Don t fix it until it leaks or cracks or breaks   METHANE CLOUD Southern California Gas  a division  Sempra Energy   N SRE   said it has inspected wells more rigorously since 2014  even though state utility officials have not approved a rate hike to cover the cost  said company spokeswoman Kristine Lloyd  The inspections  she said   exceed traditional industry practices and regulatory requirements   Lloyd said she did not know if the leaking well in Aliso Canyon was among the 26 wells the company said should be abandoned because they are too old or  mechanically unsound   as the rate filing described them  A month before the well failed  the nation s leading oil and gas lobbying group  the American Petroleum Institute  published 60 pages of guidelines for monitoring and maintenance of storage wells  Other industry groups have supported having the API standards adopted as federal regulation  It s telling that the industry is inviting more oversight  said Tim O Connor  director of California oil and gas programs for the Environmental Defense Fund   Up and down  the general consensus is that the regulations that exist in California are wholly insufficient   The fracking boom has intensified pressure on the nation s aging system of underground storage  About 20 percent of gas used in the U S  during winter now comes from storage fields  according to the American Gas Association  Many of the facilities are depleted oil or gas reservoirs that have been converted to store natural gas  which is then pulled from the ground by wells  The Aliso Canyon leak increased the state s methane emissions by 25 percent in its first month  estimated the California Air Resources Board  Methane is 72 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide in the 20 years after it is emitted  according to CARB  Initial efforts to plug the well with mud and brine failed  The utility is now drilling two relief wells more than 8 500 feet below the surface and planning to pump in water and cement  The utility said on Monday that it expects to stop the leak by late February  WARNING SIGNS In its 2014 rate filing  the utility sought  180 million in rate increases over six years to evaluate its storage wells  The California Public Utility Commission has made no decision in the rate case  The CPUC also has not decided on a request from PG E for more than  1 billion in rate increases to finance maintenance of its gas pipeline and storage infrastructure   The commission did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story  PG E  in a 2013 internal document  expressed little faith in state monitoring of gas storage wells  noting  an absence of industry standards    The company said it was working to fill this  gap  by helping API develop its guidelines  The industry group s recommendations go into minute detail on matters including how storage facility data should be collected  how staff should be trained and how emergencies should be handled  PG E is working to incorporate those practices into its operations  spokesman Greg Snapper said  Concerns about the nation s natural gas infrastructure have intensified since 2010  when a PG E pipeline exploded  leveling an entire neighborhood in San Bruno  California and killing eight people  The National Transportation Safety Board later blamed PG E for lax pipeline safety and faulted both the California PUC and the federal pipeline regulator for weak oversight  SELF REGULATION California s oil and gas regulator   the Division of Oil  Gas and Geothermal Resources   acknowledged problems with oversight but pointed to an effort launched before the leak to update regulations  The industry also has an incentive to police itself  said agency spokesman Don Drysdale   Regardless of the regulations  it s in an operator s interest not to have leaks  because that means they re losing their product   he said  Earlier this month  Governor Jerry Brown ordered the agency to issue emergency safety regulations for underground gas storage  Last week  it proposed requiring facilities to submit plans for inspections and leak detection and to test all safety valve systems every six months  The lack of federal oversight has been debated sporadically for more than two decades  Federal regulators declined to assume authority over gas storage facilities after three people were killed in a 1992 explosion at an underground cavern operated by Seminole Pipeline Co near Brenham  Texas  That decision was criticized after a 2001 gas leak in underground salt caverns in Kansas caused explosions that killed two people  The facility fell under federal jurisdiction  but federal and state regulators hit legal snags when they explored how to penalize the facility s operator  El Paso Corp  which sent its gas across state lines   Kansas was forbidden from regulating interstate commerce   and the federal agency had not written rules it could enforce  A decade later  in 2011  the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration asked industry groups whether they supported federal regulation of storage facilities in such cases  The industry supported oversight  but the agency has still not crafted regulations  Last year  U S  Senator Pat Roberts  a Republican from Kansas  introduced a bill targeting  a dangerous lapse in the oversight  and proposing that states take over regulating all stored gas  even when it is slated for interstate transport  
A separate safety bill including the same provision passed a key Senate committee in December  It also directs the federal government to craft national safety standards for underground gas storage within two years ",2016-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-california-gas-leak-spotlights-shoddy-regulation-of-aging-storage-wells-381225,381225

trading countries Energy Sector Stands 2ndWhile the Asian giant has agreed to purchase more goods and services from America  Washington has pledged to cut some tariff on Chinese imports  Notably  the U S  energy sector is poised to gain heavily from this agreement as an export revival is expected  Of the additional  200 billion purchase of U S  goods over the next two years  keeping 2017 imports as the base level    52 4 billion will likely come from the energy sector  Per the deal  China will purchase  18 5 billion worth of energy products this year  followed by  33 9 billion imports in 2021  The energy sector stands second only to the manufacturing sector  which will likely witness  77 7 billion of exports Effect of the Deal on Energy Products LNGAmong the energy products such as liquefied natural gas  LNG   crude oil  natural gas  petroleum products  LNG is expected to gain the most from the deal  Following the U S  shale revolution  abundance of natural gas in the domestic market and growing demand for cleaner energy sources globally have led to the development of several LNG terminal projects in the past few years  As such  the Washington Beijing deal can open up a huge market for the U S  LNG industry While China is set to become the biggest LNG importer by the end of the decade  the United States is likely to be the largest exporter by 2025  ahead of Qatar and Australia  This makes the two countries a perfect fit even though the whole vision is largely dependent on the fate of the existing 25  Chinese LNG tariff  This was levied during the trade war and its future is still uncertain The existing LNG export facilities like Cheniere Energy  Inc  s   NYSE LNG   Corpus Christi  TX terminal are poised to gain from the renewed opening to the China market  Jack Fusco  chief executive officer of Cheniere was present at the trade deal signing ceremony  He said   The phase one agreement between the United States and China is a step in the right direction that will hopefully restore the burgeoning U S  LNG trade with China    Other companies like ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   with Freeport LNG  Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE   with Cameron LNG will likely grab a share of this market  Tellurian Inc    NASDAQ TELL    a newcomer in the LNG game  is also expected to thrive from the recent developments EthanolAnother energy product  ethanol  is considered in the  other agricultural commodities  basket  Notably  the U S  agricultural products command  32 billion of Chinese imports in two years  The U S  ethanol producers are currently watching over the movement of the 70  import tariff levied on the products that nearly wiped out Chinese exports  Resumption of ethanol export to China at 2016 levels will likely bring  an addition  500 million against the U S  trade deficit with China    per Katie Bays  co founder of Sandhill Strategy Crude Oil China is the largest crude importer in the world with almost 11 million barrels per day imports  Notably  the trade war has eliminated Chinese crude purchases from the United States for six months through November  reflecting an opportunity loss  Still  U S  crude exports touched a record 4 5 million barrels per day during 2019 end  as shipments to Europe and other regions rose significantly  This was supported by shale boom  Permian in particular  wherein companies like Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD    Callon Petroleum Company   NYSE CPE   and others have significant operations  Both these companies have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  The 5  tariff on U S  crude levied by China reduced its economic advantage in the Chinese market  However  with trade tensions de escalating  crude export to China can rise in the coming days  which makes investors optimistic Coal   PropaneIt constitutes a small portion of the energy products basket in the trade deal  China is currently the biggest producer of coal  It bought  128 million of U S  coal last year through November  Notably  China pledged to buy more U S  metallurgical coal in the coming two years Another product  propane carries a 25  tariff that was levied on Aug 23  2018  China s petrochemicals industry is considered as a potential market for the U S  propane  Imports were estimated at  2 billion in 2018 ConclusionThe U S  energy industry has welcomed the de escalation of the trade war between the two countries  which removed billion dollars of export sales in the last two years  However  the industry heads are taking cautious steps while trying to make a better sense of this temporary trade deal and waiting hopefully for the second phase  With the existing tariffs in place  investors are wondering how China is planning to fulfil their end of the bargain  Nevertheless  China represents a huge opportunity for U S  energy exports  especially for the natural gas industry 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys

123204,344719,SRE,Sempra  SRE  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Sempra  SRE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Sempra currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SRE that show why this natural gas and electricity provider shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For SRE  shares are up 4 97  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Gas Distribution industry is up 3 22  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 85  compares favorably with the industry s 2  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Sempra have risen 11 87   and are up 40 57  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 10 96  and 26 54   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to SRE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  SRE is currently averaging 985 603 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with SRE 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost SRE s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 13 to  6 17 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that SRE is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Sempra on your short list ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sempra-sre-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200500729,200500729

123269,344784,SRE,Earnings Preview  Sempra  SRE  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Sempra  SRE  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This natural gas and electricity provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 32 billion  down 9 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 56  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sempra 
For Sempra  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 80  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sempra will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sempra would post earnings of  1 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 92  delivering a surprise of  13 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sempra doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-sempra-sre-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200445738,200445738

What s Next for Sempra 
While Sempra has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Sempra was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

123274,344789,SRE,3  No Brainer  Dividend Growers To Buy On This Pullback  With A 37  Upside,opinion,"If you re like most income investors right now  you ve got one eye on this twitchy market and the other on red flags like slumping manufacturing numbers  chaos in DC and even the dreaded inverted yield curve 
I m worried  too  But our best play here is not to sit in cash  With your mattress full  you ll be forced to stand by as inflation drains your savings 
Worse  you re certain to miss the next rebound  Because that s the real mistake perma bears always make  staying out of the market too long 
That s why the smart move here is to buy  But we re still going to take out some portfolio  insurance  by focusing on  crash resistant  stocks 
These are firms that hold fast in a crash and hand us growing income until the  inevitable  rebound arrives  I ll have three names two high yielding real estate investment trusts  REITs  and a closed end fund  CEF  for you shortly 
Each is growing their payout fast like the 37   raise  over five years that one lucky group of investors got 
4 Things Every Stock Needs to Beat a Crash
First  for a stock to be  crash resistant   it needs four key strengths 
A high dividend  because when trouble hits  investors will be desperate to hedge their downside with a cash stream 
Surging payout growth because a rising dividend acts like a magnet on a stock s price  pulling it up as the payout rises 
A history of surviving  and thriving  in a crash if a stock fended off the last pullback  it should fend off the next one  too 
A low beta rating  You can find beta ratings on any stock screener  If a stock sports a beta of 1  it s as volatile as the market  More than 1   more volatile  Less than 1   less volatile 
I ve put hundreds of stocks through this four step  boot camp   Here are three survivors  ranked from the lowest yield to the highest 
 Crash Resistant  Dividend No  1  Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI  
Dividend yield  3 3 
5 year dividend growth  37 2 
Beta  0 27
Cell tower landlord Crown Castle  NYSE CCI  is a great way for us to piggyback megatrends like ultra fast 5G networks  artificial intelligence and data analytics 
In fact  this is why CCI often gets lumped in with volatile tech stocks  But this REIT is far from volatile  That has a lot to do with its fast dividend growth  which pries its share price higher  no matter what the economy does 
Check out how CCI s surging payout drove up its price in the four years leading up to  and through  the crash of late 2018 the pattern is uncanny 
Dividend Growth Powers CCI 





And don t let that dip at the end of the chart above fool you  Zoom in on the late 2018 pullback  the most recent proving ground we have  and you ll see that CCI in blue below dipped far less than the S P 500 
CCI Rolls Through the Storm  





One thing I love about this management team is that it s 100  dedicated to payout growth  they declare their intention to grow the dividend 7 to 8  a year on page one of their investor presentation 
They can easily meet this pledge  adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  a better measure of REIT performance than earnings per share  surged 9  in the second quarter as its tenants including  Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ  and AT T  NYSE T  bolstered their networks to get set for 5G 
The kicker  CCI pays out a low  for a REIT  77  of AFFO as dividends  So even if a recession hits  management has plenty of room to keep the payout rising 
 Crash Resistant  Dividend No  2  National Health Investors  NYSE NHI 
Dividend yield  5 1 
5 year dividend growth  36 4 
Beta  0 29
Healthcare is a go to when times get rough  and with good reason  US healthcare spending is soaring  despite Democrats  Medicare for All proposals  because Americans are getting older 
According to the Census Bureau  in 2035  people aged 65 and older will outnumber those under the age of 18 for the first time ever 





That s part of the reason why the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services see healthcare spending growing at a 5 5  yearly clip  hitting nearly  6 trillion by 2027 and accounting for an outsized 19 4  of GDP 
Enter NHI  which invests in seniors  housing  medical centers and skilled nursing facilities  The stock has proven its mettle in a correction  delivering a steady total return in late 2018  while the market dove 
NHI Investors Skipped the Last Pullback





The beauty of NHI is that it gives you a high 5 1  dividend now and strong dividend growth  too 
Another Dividend Magnet





Just like with Crown Castle  NYSE CCI   you can see the share price rising to meet that payout as it pops higher  and yes  that gap at the end represents our price upside  
NHI has plenty of room to keep the payout growing  its dividend is 77  of the midpoint of projected 2019 FFO  That s more than manageable for NHI  which gets predictable interest and lease income from its tenants and borrowers 
 Crash Resistant  Dividend No  3   Reaves Utility Income Fund   NYSE UTG 
Dividend yield  5 9 
5 year dividend growth  30 9 
Beta  0 5
Everyone knows utilities are a rock in unsteady times  But there are two problems with utilities now 
Ho hum dividends  The benchmark Utilities Select Sector ETF  XLU  yields 2 9  today Utilities  safety is no secret  which is why XLU has beaten the market this year  leaving few bargains in the space except one 
That would be the Reaves Utility Income Fund  UTG   a CEF holding rock steady utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   Verizon  NYSE VZ  and  Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE  
Just by picking UTG over XLU  you re getting double the dividend  5 9    UTG also lived up to its beta of 0 5 last year  dipping only half as much as the market 
And the management team at Reaves  an investment firm with nearly 60 years of history  has delivered upside most investors can only dream of  crushing the S P 500 since inception no small feat for a fund focused on low volatility utilities 
UTG  A True Tortoise and Hare Story





Best of all  much of that return was in cash  thanks to UTG s higher yield 
There s more to come  UTG trades at a 1 2  discount to its NAV meaning its market price is slightly below the value of its portfolio  That doesn t sound like much  but this fund traded at a 4 9  premium as recently as mid August 
With more volatility ahead  you can bet UTG s premium will snap back above 5   When it does  it will pull the fund s price along with it

123301,344816,SRE,Can U S  LNG Export Projects Fight Off Trade War Headwinds ,opinion,America s escalating trade dispute with China has been weighing on sentiments across markets  On May 10  Washington raised tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10  to 25   while Beijing retaliated by imposing higher duties on a revised list of 5 140 U S  goods worth  60 billion  Among others  China raised the tariff on imported liquefied natural gas  or LNG  to 25  from the prior level of 10  The deteriorating Sino U S  relationship in the form of several rounds of new tariffs  or tax on imports  is feared to be a major headwind for the massive U S  LNG export projects as China is the second biggest importer of the fuel behind Japan   Let s look at the potential implications for LNG exports in light of the bitter and protracted trade dispute between two world s largest economies  We also examine how this escalation of the tariff war will impact the future U S  LNG projects and the billions of dollars poured into these plants  as well as the effects on Cheniere Energy  Inc    NYSE LNG     the U S  s only listed LNG export pure play U S  Companies Look to Take Advantage of Cheap Domestic Natural GasDriven by shale extraction  natural gas output in the United States have climbed to record levels The EIA forecasts that U S  will produce 90 7 billion cubic feet a day  Bcf d  of dry natural gas this year  up from the 2018 average of 83 4 Bcf d   a record high for the second consecutive year  The agency also projected that domestic gas output would rise to an all time high of 92 Bcf d in 2020 Soaring volumes are weighing on the outlook for prices  Meanwhile  companies like Cheniere Energy foresees the fundamentals of LNG to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation worldwide and in the Asia Pacific region in particular  With domestic prices remaining constrained on the back of abundant supplies  the company sees a big opportunity in selling U S  natural gas production at higher prices overseas China  Major Driver of LNG Demand GrowthPer the Anglo Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc s   NYSE D     LNG demand reached 319 million tons last year   up by 27 million tons from 2017 and significantly higher than the 100 million traded in the year 2000  The 300  million tons of LNG trade in 2018 was enough to power about 643 million homes Global LNG demand is likely to continue growing for the next few years and is projected to rise to around 384 million tons per annum by 2020  Supplies from Chevron led   NYSE CVX   Gorgon and Wheatstone mega projects in Australia are already being absorbed by the strong demand through long term contracts of up to 20 years While the increasing demand for gas in the European power sector will be a key factor in the near term LNG supply rise  the consumption boost is primarily set to come from Asian importers like China  India  South Korea and Pakistan as part of efforts to switch from coal and heating oil for environmental reasons Japan remains the world s largest buyer of LNG but China leapfrogged South Korea to take the second place in 2017  As the nation transitions from coal to natural gas  China s imports of LNG rose 40  in 2018 to 16 million tons Investors should also note that China s crackdown on pollution has created a long term positive trend for LNG demand growth with the country required to buy roughly 40  of its overall consumption in the face of domestic production shortage  Meanwhile  the comeback of nuclear power in Japan is cutting into the demand for gas fired power generation and  by extension  LNG demand Cheniere  The First Company to Export LNG from the United StatesWhile there are a number of North American LNG export projects lined up for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC    Cheniere Energy s terminals in Louisiana and Texas  Dominion Energy Inc  s   NYSE D   Cove Point export plant in Maryland and Sempra Energy s   NYSE SRE   Cameron LNG in Hackberry are the only ones operating currently   Being the first company to receive FERC approval to export LNG from its 2 6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish  Louisiana  Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage It s true that Cheniere Energy is not entirely dependent on a single country  with the company boasting of a diversified customer base having shipped LNG cargoes to 32 different nations and regions worldwide  Still  it must be admitted that China is a leader in global LNG import growth and the country is a major area of thrust for Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Cheniere Energy  which already has two long term supply agreements signed in the country You can see  Conclusion  According to consultant   LNG demand from China is expected to reach 95 million tons in 2025  turning the country into the world s biggest importer  On the other hand  going by the existing sanctioned projects  U S  volumes of LNG exports is set to rise almost four folds by the same timeframe to 84 million tons per annum But with China targeting LNG from United States for import levies as part of its tit for tat tariff measure  there is a risk that U S  exports would become uncompetitive  Moreover  the LNG projects aiming for final investment decision   including Cheniere Energy s Sabine Pass Train 6 and Tellurian Inc  s   NASDAQ TELL   Driftwood LNG   might be adversely affected as these capital intensive developments must secure long term contracts to ensure multi billion dollar financing  As it is  LNG prices are on a downward spiral on estimated supply growth  mostly from the United States  The Chinese buyers are also on the lookout for purchasing natural gas from non U S  LNG suppliers  which could jeopardize the likes of Cheniere Energy s revenues  since it enjoys a dominant position in the U S  LNG export market  Cheniere Energy will reportedly supply about  18 billion of natural gas chilled to liquid form as part of a long term contract with China s state owned Sinopec   NYSE SNP    However  the agreement will be formally signed only after the trade tensions are resolved Therefore  a potential lengthy U S  China trade war could be a big letdown for the American LNG exporters and certainly pose risk for the future

123302,344817,SRE,Global Oil And Natural Gas,opinion,"Murky Outlook
The outlook in the short term for oil looks a bit murkier this morning  A surprise 2 4 million barrel increase in oil inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute  API  and concerns that the Trump administration is looking to expand the technology ban it put on Huawei  Stocks rallied back as the Trump Administration granted a bit of a grace period  but reports that he is expanding the ban to other Chinese companies like ZTE  HK 0763   Hytera  SZ 002583  and Dahua  as well as others caused some oil selling overnight on concerns the trade war might hurt global oil demand  Yet while the oil struggles on the headlines of the moment  talk of a tight oil physical market and less than satisfying 350 000 barrel increase in gasoline supply with a draw of 237 000 barrels in distillate supply shows that  for petroleum products we have a tight market and not a lot of room for error  Refiners at some point will have to rise to the occasion and start ramping up soon and these recent crude oil increases will soon become a distant memory 
Oil is also easing on reports that the threat of hostilities with Iran has cooled off  The Wall Street Journal reported that  Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan  who briefed congressional lawmakers  said that the prospect of an Iranian attack on Americans has been put  on hold   outlining a reduction of the potential threat after earlier U S  intelligence suggested a high degree of danger  I think our steps were very prudent  and we ve put on hold the potential for attacks on Americans   Mr  Shanahan told reporters   And that s what s extremely important   That easing of tensions  while not a guarantee  is reducing some of the risk premium 
Risk premium is real and does affect prices  I hear from some folks that think that risk premium is just an excuse to jack up prices  but they are wrong  Bloomberg News for example reported that  Not since 2005 have the world s insurers considered shipping in the Persian Gulf so dangerous for oil tankers   The Joint War Committee of London s Lloyd s Market Association said Friday that it would expand its so called  listed areas     those regions that pose the greatest risks for shipping  and potentially warranting higher insurance costs    to include the entire Persian Gulf  The last time the entire region held the designation was a period that ended in June 2005 and encompassed the most recent Iraq War  It highlights the growing risks in the world s most important export region and chokepoint for oil  
That report confirms what we have said  that the risk to oil supply was the highest since the Persian Gulf wars and it is being fairly reflected in the price  Now as those risks recede  so will the price  No one complains when prices go down because of a reduction of risk  But if the market failed to consider those risks and reflect those in the price  it could cause a calamity for the global economy 
You can say we should ignore those risks and not price them in because it is unlikely that something bad will actually happen  I guess you could say the same thing about your house insurance  But if you have a house that is worth  500 000 and you only insure for  100 000  if it burns down you will take a huge financial hit 
We also still have issues in the shale patch that may signal that the loftier projections of U S  crude oil output may be overstated  There are also signs that shale companies must rein in costs if they are going to achieve profitability  Reuters for example reported that  Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD  Co  one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico  announced on Tuesday that it had cut about a quarter of its workforce to save costs and boost shareholder value  Irving   Texas based Pioneer laid off 230 employees this week at its headquarters and in its Permian Basin offices  and cut another 300 workers in April  the company said in statement It expects  100 million in cost reductions  in order to remain competitive with our peers   Pioneer said in a statement   Decisions like these are never easy  In this case they were necessary to both align our cost structure with our business strategy and to create value for our shareholders over the long term   the company said in a statement  
Yet cutting costs may also lead to lower output  For shale  you must keep drilling and spending money to offset the steep production decline curve  A curve that is getting steeper with every shale well drilled 
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Saudi Arabia has agreed to purchase U S  liquefied natural gas from Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE   a new strategic direction for the kingdom as it seeks to establish a footprint in the growing global market for the fuel 
Saudi Arabian Oil Co   known as Aramco  plans to purchase gas from San Diego based Sempra Energy s Port Arthur project in Texas  people familiar with the matter said  The financial terms of the deal couldn t be determined  and it wasn t clear whether Aramco would also take an equity stake in the project  the people said  Aramco had been expected to close a deal to purchase LNG after holding talks with several U S  producers and a Russian producer in recent months  It isn t clear whether the gas will be used to power the kingdom s local economy or sold on to international buyers  Aramco didn t immediately respond to a request for comment made outside business hours  Sempra didn t immediately respond to requests for comment 
The Journal Says that the deal demonstrates how the U S  energy boom is dramatically changing global trade  Historically  Saudi Arabia has been a major supplier of oil to the U S  But with the evolution of shale drilling in the U S   the Energy Department predicts America will become a net energy exporter next year  Shale has catapulted the U S  to being one of the top shippers of LNG  with the Energy Information Administration forecasting it will become the world s third largest exporter in 2019

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  UGI is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Sempra has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that UGI s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
UGI currently has a forward P E ratio of 22 14  while SRE has a forward P E of 22 93  We also note that UGI has a PEG ratio of 2 77  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  SRE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 96 
Another notable valuation metric for UGI is its P B ratio of 2 14  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SRE has a P B of 2 21 
Based on these metrics and many more  UGI holds a Value grade of A  while SRE has a Value grade of D 
UGI sticks out from SRE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that UGI is the better option right now ",2019-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ugi-vs-sre-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200438061,200438061

123338,344853,SRE,Bright Near Term Outlook For Utility Gas Distribution Industry ,opinion,"The Zacks  industry comprises companies that offer services to transport natural gas from the region of production to end users  Gas distribution pipelines play a crucial role in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small diameter distribution pipelines  Notably  the natural gas network in the United States has nearly 3 million miles of pipeline   Increasing consumption of natural gas in the United States and internationally is driving demand for distribution pipelines Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes  Increasing U S  shale production and the awareness to lower emission have pushed up natural gas production in the United States  Since capacity of the existing pipelines will eventually be inadequate to meet rising transportation requirements  pipeline operators will have enormous opportunities to add new ones  This is particularly true due to the fact that natural gas is generally not stored at the consumption site like other conventional fossil fuel sources  The United States has started exporting LNG and volumes should increase as new LNG export terminals are coming into operation  So  demand for dedicated natural gas pipelines will increase as more of the commodity is transported from production zones to LNG export facilities  In addition  increasing oil and natural gas production from the Permian Basin region is creating a bottleneck in transporting the commodities  As a result  more pipelines are being planned in this region to take the produce to consumers and export terminals  Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  release  natural gas production in the United States will increase by 7  per year during the 2018 to 2020 time period  primarily due to higher domestic consumption and improving exports  The improvement in natural gas production will also call for the addition and expansion of natural gas pipelines  Recently  the U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  approved the full in service of the Mountaineer XPress natural gas pipeline project  For the next few years  more investments in natural gas pipelines are lined up to meet rising demand for pipeline services   Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Strong ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects The Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry   a 17 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector   currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  78  which places it at the top 30  of 257 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate Before we present a few Gas Distribution stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Beat S P 500 and SectorThe Gas Distribution industry has outperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 18  in the past year  while the Utility sector and the Zacks S P 500 composite have gained 10  each over the same period One Year Price Performance
 Gas Distribution Industry s Current ValuationSince utility companies have a lot of debt on their balance sheets  the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio is commonly used to value them The industry is currently trading at trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 13 04X compared with the S P 500 s 10 96X and the sector s 14 73X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio of Industry v S P 500

123339,344854,SRE,Sempra  SRE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Sempra  SRE  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This natural gas and electricity provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 12 billion  up 5 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 47  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sempra 
For Sempra  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sempra will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sempra would post earnings of  1 47 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 56  delivering a surprise of  6 12  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sempra doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sempra-sre-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200413093,200413093

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Sempra has an Earnings ESP of  1 71  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 26  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-sempra-sre-200381352,200381352

123410,344925,SRE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Cheniere  Sempra  Kinder Morgan And NextDecade,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  January 18  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Cheniere Energy  Inc    NYSE LNG    Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE    Kinder Morgan  Inc    NYSE KMI   and NextDecade Corporation   NASDAQ NEXT   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Can U S  Threaten Russia s Dominance in Europe s Gas Market With Europe using up more natural gas than it produces  the continent has long been eyed by liquefied natural gas  LNG  exporters  According to Forbes  demand for natural gas in the continent touched the highest mark in 2017 since 2010  Demand is going to rise further as natural gas  contribution to Europe s energy needs is expected to increase from the current 24  to 30  in the coming years  said the International Energy Agency  IEA  Meanwhile  Europe has been excessively relying on Russia s gas supplies  However  the continent has been trying to reduce dependence on the politically unstable Moscow and has decided to import more LNG from the United States in the coming years  Washington is keen to bump up its LNG supplies to Europe and has been accordingly building a number of LNG export terminals  especially in the Gulf Coast area US LNG Export to Europe Very High Last OctoberWashington dispatched 24  of its exported LNG volumes to Europe last October  per CNBC  The source added that the volume of LNG exported was 0 6 billion cubic meters and America has never before exported such high monthly volumes  Against this  just 10  of the LNG exported volumes of America had gone to Europe in 2017 Exports of LNG from Washington to the continent are estimated to double by 2022  per the European Commission  a politically independent executive unit of European Union However  U S  gas supplies to Europe will only increase if the price is competitive  added the European Union  In recent years  the Henry Hub natural gas spot price had come down following new discoveries and plentiful supply in the domestic market  The price of natural gas is below  4 per Million Btu now as compared to more than  6 mostly from 2005 through 2008 Russia s Clear Dominance in EuropePer recent data from the European Commission  the continent continues to have the strongest reliance on Russian gas  In fact  owing to proximity with Europe  Russia accounted for more than 75  of the natural gas imported volumes of each of the 11 member states of the European Union   Estonia  Slovakia  Bulgaria  Czech Republic  Latvia  Hungary  Austria  Poland  Finland  Romania  and Slovenia Through the extensive pipeline network of leading energy company Gazprom  MCX GAZP   Russia transports a bulk of its natural gas to Europe  Transportation expenses have come down due to the favorable geographic position of the country and the continent  Established midstream assets and several pipeline networks   under construction   have also lent Russia an advantageous position Can US Gain Lead in Europe s Gas Market For U S  to outmanoeuvre Russia and get a foothold in Europe  it could exploit the strained ties between Europe and Russia  apart from the quite obvious option of ramping up supplies  The relationship started deteriorating since early 2014 following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine by Russia  Moscow also assisted the insurgence of pro Russian in east Ukraine Overall  the rising export of U S  LNG to the European market is expected to brighten prospects for domestic players like Cheniere Energy  Inc   Sempra Energy  Kinder Morgan  Inc  and NextDecade Corporation  These Zacks  3 Ranked companies are contemplating the construction of export facilities or expansion of terminals  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here  However  the growing acceptance of U S  LNG doesn t necessarily mean that Washington poses a threat to Moscow  believes RBC Capital Markets  The established midstream infrastructures and proximity to Europe have made Russia a dominant natural gas supplier to the continent  added the investment bank  Hence  it will take time for Washington to overtake Moscow and establish its presence as a prominent supplier of the commodity to Europe Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But

demand response program of 4 5 MW from CPUC  The company expects to this project to come online by next year to continue its initiative for a greener San Diego Energy storage is essential to conserve electricity to be used later when demand is high but supply is low The company is committed to supplement more energy storage is the system and has plans to add another 330 MW of storage facility by 2030  The increased storage capacity will help it improve power grid reliability and provide more of renewable  cleaner and sustainable future to its customers Need for Storage CapacityRenewable Energy is attaining popularity as no pollutant is released during electricity generation  However  the greatest drawback of producing energy from a renewable source is the non  availability of the primary resources of sunlight and wind pressure 24X7  Sometimes  excessive renewable energy output is issued when the weather is favorable and demand for power is low Energy Storage facilities are a solution to above mentioned problems  Renewable energy stored in the batteries could be used during high demand without weighing on the fossil fuel plants  In a way  these energy storage facilities will help accelerate growth of renewable energy generation plants and lower the emission level   As of Mar 31  2018  per U S  Department of Energy  the United States boasts an electric energy storage capacity of more than 25 gigawatts  GW   Of the total capacity  94  is in the form of pumped hydroelectric storage and the rest 6  in the form of battery  thermal storage  compressed air and flywheel

front over the past decade  In 2017  global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11   bringing the global total to 540 GW  Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow more rapidly than fossil fuels over the next two decades Per U S  Energy Information Administration report  during 2014 2017 time period  renewable sources accounted for more than 50  of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States  In 2018  9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be added  showing the rising significance of renewable sources across

123481,344996,SRE,Utilities Outlook For Summer 2018  Sempra  Portland Electric  CenterPoint,opinion,"Summary
The NOAA is projecting higher than average temperatures for the West Coast  Texas  and NE 
Costs should be contained 
Texas could have problems related to insufficient reserves 
Recently  the FERC released their summer electricity market projections which contain a great deal of relevant information for the utility market  So  let s dig into the report  starting with the weather forecast 

 Let s overlay this with the various utility market regions 
 The entire California region is projected to have higher temperatures  which could also mean an increased potential for wildfires  This is not a good development  various California state authorities are currently investigating the cause of last summer s fires  and  should they determine that utilities are at least partially to blame  will penalize them accordingly  Pacific Gas and Electric  PCG  has already suspended their dividend over this  Most of the Southwest region and the entire NE will also see higher temperatures as will the NW 
Next  here s a map of areas where we could see increased power congestion over the summer 

 In the north  the Chicago area is ripe for demand supply imbalances  Areas around Philadelphia  Baltimore  and Washington DC represent the Eastern cities that could see spiking demand  In the West  NW Texas SE New Mexico could see problems as could the Houston area  great  my home   California appears poised for another challenging summer 
Could there be power constraints due to increased demand lower support  Yes 

 A utility reserve is exactly what it sounds like  power that you can bring online in case of heightened demand  ERCOT is the  Electric Reliability Council of Texas   and they are projecting weaker reserves due to the following reasons  from the FERC report  

Costs are a mixed picture  Natural Gas prices are mostly lower 

 In some places  natural gas prices are off 16   in others  they re down nearly 30   At the same time  coal prices are higher 

 In the chart above  coal prices are in orange  Prices are up a bit over their previous peak in early 2017 
While this would usually mean that natural gas plants would see increased demand  remember that the administration has issued a new directive that coal generated power is to be given purchasing priority  which could increase costs more than distributors would normally pay 
So  taking all of this information into consideration  what utilities look attractive 
I ll take this geographically  moving from the West to the East 
California
I m fairly bearish on the state s utilities  largely due to the fallout from last year s wildfires  As I noted in my review of its latest earnings release  PGE is facing lawsuits and numerous investigations from various California entities  Right now  the only California utility that isn t facing these issues is Sempra  SRE   This is a function of geography  SRE supplies power to the San Diego area  which wasn t hit by any of last year s fires  I wrote about the company s year end performance in early March  they re a solid company with a great deal of potential  While their current PE is a little over 25  their forward PE is 16  Their current yield is 3 5  
Northwest 
I recently wrote a piece on the Northwestern utilities where I advocated on behalf of Northwestern Utilities  NYSE NWE   While this is still a great company  as are most of the NW utilities   given the potential for higher demand due to projected higher temperatures  Portland Electric  NYSE POR  is a better choice  I wrote about the company earlier this year  where I concluded

Portland General Electric  while off the beaten path  is a well run and profitable utility  Unlike its East Coast brethren  POR has experienced strong revenue growth in the last four years  Management has improved margins and recently raised the dividend  The company has more than adequate cash flow for its interest and dividend payments while maintaining a conservative debt asset ratio  For utility investors  this is definitely a company to consider adding to your portfolio 

Texas
The Texas market is the only utility market where the FERC has projected lower reserves than projected demand  This could lead to a situation where electricity rates spike due to huge mismatches between supply and demand  remember that with utilities  supply can t be stored  so if demand spikes when power plants are idled or operating at lower capacity  costs will spike   Therefore  we could be seeing potentially profitable situations for the utilities  even after the PUC takes its pound of flesh 
Houston  my home city and home to the World Champion Astros  is projected to have bottlenecks this summer  I wrote about CenterPoint  CNP  earlier this year where I concluded 

Centerpoint is a bit more diversified than AEP  Centerpoint is far more exposed to the natural gas market  their electricity division accounts for 31  of their revenue  But as a result  they re had two very strong years in the last four  while also making them the better company for dividend investors  And with a current yield of slightly over 4   they re a bit more attractive than AEP  whose current yield is 3 61  
So  of the publicly traded Texas utilities  take Centerpoint 

Chicago  Philadelphia  and Baltimore
Chicago  Philadelphia  Baltimore  and Washington DC are serviced by subsidiaries of Exelon  NYSE EXC   They had a great year and first quarter 

EXC had a great quarter   more so for a utility  They had strong revenue gains and  were it not for one time items the previous year  would probably have had a modest gain in net income  The stock is currently outperforming the SPYs and is technically attractive  If you ve wanted to add this stock to your portfolio  now is the time to do so 

Conclusion  the four stocks mentioned above are positioned to benefit from potential spikes in demand should the heat wave projected by the NOAA emerge

123484,344999,SRE,Sempra  SRE  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Sempra  SRE  reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This natural gas and electricity provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 83 billion  up 5 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 89  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sempra 
For Sempra  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 77  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Sempra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sempra would post earnings of  1 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 35  delivering a surprise of  15 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sempra appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sempra-sre-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200352399,200352399

123550,345065,SRE,Is Sempra Energy  SRE  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Sempra Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Sempra Energy s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Sempra Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 19 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Sempra Energy stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Sempra Energy has a P S ratio of about 2 5  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Sempra Energy currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Sempra Energy a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Sempra Energy is just 2 2  a level that is lower than the industry average of 3 7  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  SRE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Sempra Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A This gives SRE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched UP by 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PRICE AND CONSENSUS CHARTDespite this bullish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Sempra Energy Price and Consensus   Sempra Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 40  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best

123551,345066,SRE,China s Blue Skies Initiative Could Boost These American LNG Stocks,opinion,"One of the main messages I give readers in my articles is that you have to pay attention to global events to find the best investment opportunities 
Another great example of that occurred in March at China s annual parliamentary meeting  The one main takeaway from that meeting could be summed up by one sentence that was repeated again and again at the meeting    We will make our skies blue again  
The Chinese are  finally  very serious about curbing the rampant pollution in their country  This has boosted industrial metals prices globally as China curbs output of aluminum and steel in the country  And China has cut back on the use of coal for both power and heating purposes  As a substitute for coal  the Chinese government is placing a major emphasis on natural gas 
Therein lies the opportunity 
China s LNG Imports While China does produce some of its own natural gas and imports more gas from Russia via pipelines  the all of a sudden big increase in natural gas demand has had almost immediate effects 
In early December  that demand pushed LNG  liquified natural gas  prices in Asia to a three year high  20  higher than a year ago   and up 80  from the 2017 low   at above  10 per million BTU  According to energy consultants Wood Mackenzie  import volumes of LNG were 48  higher in the first ten months of 2017  This follows a 25  jump the year before 
A cold winter in northern China raised demand even more and made authorities desperate to meet the need  In December  Chinese oil company CNOOC Limited  NYSE CEO  was forced to hire over 100 LNG carrying trucks to bring LNG over 1 300 miles from the south of China  where the LNG import facilities are  to the northern parts of the country where the cold of winter was biting hard 
And while prices have fallen somewhat since with a January thaw  this trend toward higher LNG demand from China is a feature of the energy market that will be with us for many years 
In an interesting side note for natural gas  there is talk in the market that energy kingpin Saudi Arabia may  in the relatively near future  have to import natural gas in the form of LNG in order to meet domestic needs  Demand there has risen by 50  over the past decade while proven Saudi gas reserves have only risen by 20  
To that end  it is believed Saudi Arabia is interested in funding LNG projects around the world  Are President Trump and U S  gas producers listening  I hope they are 
US LNG Exporters Especially since U S  capacity to process LNG is set to grow nearly seven fold by 2019 as five export terminals open 
Primary among U S  LNG exporters is Cheniere Energy Inc  NYSE LNG   which is the owner of the first LNG export terminal in the U S  that has been operating since early 2016  It is exporting at its Sabine Pass facility with three trains and a capacity of about two billion cubic feet of gas per day  Its total capacity is expected to be about five billion cubic feet per day once all five trains are completed  the fourth train was recently completed   An LNG train is a liquified natural gas plant s liquefaction and purification facility 
Chiniere s first mover advantage is evident  In November  it signed an  11 billion memorandum of understanding for long term LNG sales with China National Petroleum Corporation  CNPC is the parent of PetroChina Co Ltd ADR  NYSE PTR  
However  competition for Cheniere is underway here in the U S  There are five other facilities  in addition to Cheniere s  that will add roughly 7 5 billion cubic feet of LNG export capacity in 2018 and 2019  Here is the list of these facilities for you 
Cove Point  Maryland terminal is owned by Dominion Resources Inc  NYSE D   It used to be an import terminal that was retooled as an export terminal with a capacity of 0 82 billion cubic feet per day 
Cameron LNG  Louisiana is owned by Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE  and is scheduled to begin operation in 2018  It has three trains currently under construction with the first train expected to begin operation in early 2018  and the second and third trains are expected to start up during the second half of 2018  The three trains will have a capacity of 2 1 billion cubic feet per day 
Sempra Energy is also in the permitting stage of constructing an expansion to the facility  which would add a fourth and fifth train  Project completion for the expansion is expected sometime in 2019 
Elba Island  Georgia is a relatively small scale facility owned by Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI  with a capacity of 0 35 billion cubic feet per day  It was originally constructed as a regasification plant for imports of LNG and it is being retooled as an export facility  The project will use ten small scale liquefaction units  constructed in two phases  The first phase will begin service in mid 2018  while the second will come online in early 2019 
Freeport LNG  Texas has three trains currently under construction  It will begin operation between the end of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019  with a combined capacity of 2 14 billion cubic feet per day  A fourth train is under development 
Corpus Christi  Texas is currently under construction on 1 000 acres controlled by Cheniere Energy  It is being designed for five trains and construction on the first and second trains began in May 2015 and is now about 70  complete  The first train is expected to begin operating in the first half of 2019 with the first three trains having a combined capacity of 2 14 billion cubic feet per day 
While I do like Cheniere Energy  there are lots of LNG projects coming online in China s neighborhood   namely Australia  So instead of focusing on just LNG exporters  I am also looking at the carriers of all that LNG to China   the LNG shipping companies 
LNG Shipping Companies These companies are in the sweet spot between rising Chinese demand for LNG and limited supplies of ships  Transporting LNG requires specialized tankers and the market for these tankers has completely flipped  From a glut a few years ago  there is now a shortage of these specialized tankers 
This shortage has led to a doubling of LNG tanker rates since April 2016  And there is definitely room for further increases  Prices could double again and still not reach the highs set five years ago 
The LNG carrier shortage will not be alleviated quickly either since it takes about 30 months to build such a vessel  Between 2012 and 2014  there were orders for 66 LNG carriers  But with that aforementioned glut  orders dropped to only eight in 2017 
This will obviously benefit the companies that currently own LNG tankers  But be careful here   many of them are heavily loaded with debt  Here are two companies  though  that I am looking at 
Golar LNG Limited  NASDAQ GLNG    its stock is up nearly 20  over the past year  The company is one of the world s largest independent owners and operators of marine based LNG midstream infrastructure and is involved in the liquefaction  transportation and regasification of natural gas 
In others words  Golar is no mere LNG shipper  although it has 16 LNG shipping vessels  It is also focused on other aspects of the LNG pipeline including floating LNG liquefaction  FLNG  and floating storage and regasification units  FSRUs   It is the first company to convert ships into FSRUs and FLNGVs  floating liquefied natural gas vessel   This sets it apart from most of its competitors 
If you are looking at more of a pure play LNG shipper  there is GasLog Ltd  NYSE GLOG   whose stock is up nearly 30  over the last year  with most of that gain occurring in the last three months 
Its fleet consists of 22 LNG ships on the water with another five ships on order being built  And like Golar  it is also becoming involved with FSRUs 
However  I like Gaslog because it is one of those carriers  along with Teekay LNG Partners LP  NYSE TGP   that is greatly benefiting from the diversion of more and more LNG tankers to China  The daily rate of a 160 000 cubic meter LNG tanker soared to  80 000 in December from the 2017 low of  30 000 in April  according to ship broker Clarkson 
The third quarter of 2017 for Gaslog already saw record revenue and EBITDA  And thanks to Chinese demand  this should continue for the foreseeable future 
If you are looking more for income than capital gains  but still want to participate in the China LNG story  consider limited partnerships from the shipping firms 
Gaslog has a limited partnership worth a look  GasLog Partners LP  NYSE GLOP   which is up 5 77  over the past three months with a current yield of 8 36   And there is also the aforementioned Teekay LNG  It has risen nearly 13  over the past three months and has a 2 71  yield  Teekay will be receiving 11 new LNG vessels by the end of 2018

123617,345132,SRE,Top Research Reports For Activision Blizzard  Merck And Barclays,opinion,"Wednesday May 10  2017
Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Merck  MRK   Barclays  LON BARC   BCS  and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  
Merck shares have performed largely in line with the Zacks Large Cap Pharma industry in the year to date period   8 3  for MRK vs   7 6  for the industry   but the stock has handily outperformed the peer group over the past one year   17 4  vs   2 7    This favorable momentum should continue following the company s better than expected Q1 results when it beat top  and bottom line estimates and guided higher  The Zacks analyst likes Merck s new products  especially Keytruda  which should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line while management s cost cutting initiatives should help the bottom line  The company has also made significant progress with its pipeline and is working on bringing new products to the market  However  generic competition and pricing pressure will likely remain headwinds as are rising competition in the immuno oncology market   You can  
Barclays have underperformed the Zacks Foreign Banks industry this year  with BCS shares down  1 2  in the year to date period vs   9 3  gain for the industry  Questions about the British bank s capital position  regulatory questions and the strong Pound have all been contributors to this underperformance  The bank s recent quarterly results were fairly strong  reflecting impressive underwriting performance and substantial drop in losses in Non Core division  The company s efforts to restructure and simplify its operations should help outlook in the long run  but the aforementioned headwinds coupled with Brexit related uncertainties will likely remain issues for some time    You can  
Activision Blizzard shares have been strong performers this year  with the stock up  55 3  in the year to date period vs  the Zacks gaming industry s  29  gain in that same time period  The strong earnings reports for this quarter as well as the preceding one have added to the stock s momentum  The Zacks analyst likes Activision s enviable product portfolio and increasing digital revenues  both of which should continue to drive growth  Moreover  the company stands to benefit further from the acquisition of King Digital  The company s attempts to become a broad based media company are also prudent  Apart from launching a movie studio and consumer products division  the company is strengthening its presence in the lucrative e sports market  However  the hit driven and competitive nature of the video game industry begets caution   You can

123652,345167,SRE,Oil Ready For New Highs,opinion,"Peace on Earth
The dream of peace on earth and good will toward men was shattered once again with two incidents that defy the hopes of the season  The murder of Russia s ambassador to Turkey and the slaughter of 12 people by a terrorist driving a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin is starting to impact markets  Stocks pulled back and oil rallied slightly after the news in light volume as the world still only dreams of peace 
Now  oil prices are edging higher even as the dollar looks as it is getting ready to make new highs  Oil  backed by expectations of OPEC and non OPEC production cuts as well as signs the US economy is getting ready to take off  is increasing demand expectations and the tightening of supply  We must also be ready for more market sensitivity to terror events as we whittle down the globes cushion of supply  Problems in Turkey have been an ongoing risk to the oil market  Much oil is received from Iraq and the Caspian Sea region that then travels through the Turkish Straits that supply a lot of product to Southern and Western Europe  They are also a key export route for Russian oil  Close to 3 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products travel through the straights and further instability in the region at some point could put that at risk 
Crude oil will become more sensitive to these types of events as the global market starts to tighten  Even as US shale is sure to come back  it will take some time for the industry to catch up with planned OPEC cuts as well as issues of depleted cash  We expect that even as prices rebound  it may be too late for some companies that are teetering on the brink  It s not going be neat and pretty but we will start to make our way back 
Retail gas prices are back on the rise  AAA says that national pump prices have risen for 20 of the past 21 days  increasing a total of 11 cents during this span  The national average price for regular unleaded gasoline sits at  2 24 per gallon  which is the lowest mark since October  Today s average is three cents more than one week ago  nine cents more compared to one month ago 
Natural gas is having a hard time rallying even as demand for natural gas is probably the highest we have seen in recent memory  Power generation to fight the cold  even low temperature warnings in cold California  is sparking some alarm  Reuters reported that Southern California Gas Co   SoCalGas  has urged customers to reduce natural gas use to help lower the risk of possible gas and electricity shortages due to what it described as severe cold weather throughout the U S  Southwest  Reuters said that the notice  issued Sunday night  came as the utility continues to have only limited access to fuel in its giant Aliso Canyon gas storage facility in Los Angeles  following a massive methane leak between October 2015 February 2016  In addition to residential customers  SoCalGas  a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE   told non core customers  including refineries and power plants  that they may receive a notice to curtail service 
We continue to favor the long side on oil as we hover just below yearly highs  With the stock market looking to break records  the oil demand story should remain strong  Natural gas should rebound as the full extent of the demand side comes out in the open ",2016-12-20,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/peace-on-earth-200170372,200170372
123653,345168,SRE,OPEC Versus Shale,opinion,"Crude oil prices are trying to determine whether they should focus on historic compliance to a OPEC non OPEC cut or signs that shale producers may start to make a comeback  Despite comments over the weekend at the OPEC compliance meeting that cuts in OPEC non OPEC production were ahead of schedule  a sharp rise in U S  rig counts and talk of large increases in capital spending seem to be souring the bullish mood 
One would think the OPEC doubters would be scrambling when the Saudi energy minister  Khalid al Falih  said OPEC s 13 nations and 11 producers outside the cartel had made production cuts totaling 1 5 million barrels and are ahead of schedule in meeting its 1 8 million barrels a day target  OPEC officials reported its compliance level at 80   meaning about four fifths of the oil it pledged to cut has ben cut and is the best start to an OPEC cut in history  The key will be to see if they can stick to it as other oil producers start to respond to what looks like a bottom in the price of oil 
Oil prices though are shaken from a much larger than expected jump in U S  oil rigs  MarketWatch reported that   Data from industry group Baker Hughes shows the number of working oil rigs in the U S  climbed by 29 in the week ended Jan  20 to a total of 551  The oil rig count stands at its highest level in 14 months  per Price Futures Group s Phil Flynn   Assuming the U S  oil rig count stays at the current level  we estimate U S  oil production would increase by 315 000 barrels a day between fourth quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2017 across the Permian  Eagle Ford  Bakken and Niobrara Shale plays   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  said in a note   Dow Jones reported that the past week s gain of 36 rigs overall marked is the biggest one week surge in land rigs since 2011  Earlier this month  U S  oil production surpassed 8 9 million barrels a day  its highest level in nine months  and has stayed roughly at that level  per the latest weekly federal data   Of course 315 00 barrels a day is still a far cry from 1 8 million barrels a day but they are signs that we may start to see oil production move upward and the demand side should help level out the playing field 
Gasoline prices have fallen by 2 cents a gallon per the dean of gas price surveys  the Lundberg Survey  Regular unleaded has fallen to  2 36 a gallon as ample supply and softening demand has brought prices down  Demand this past weekend may be weak as rain and tornados impacted much of the south and cold weather in Californian kept drivers close to home 
The cold weather in California is also creating the strong possibility of a natural gas shortage  The City News Service reported that the Southern California Gas Co  warned Sunday that cold weather    and the loss of its main local storage resource    may put normal electric and natural gas deliveries at risk across Southern California next week  The company did not specify how large that risk is  The utility asked its customers to reduce natural gas use  turn down their thermostats and take other steps   to help lower the risk of possible natural gas and electricity shortages   according to a news release 
More than 95 percent of Southland homes use natural gas for heat  and 60 percent of the electricity used in the area is generated using natural gas  The company had in past years stored gas brought in by pipeline in the Aliso Canyon storage area  but that was ended when a massive natural gas leak spewed the fuel into the air above Porter Ranch  The company said it and San Diego Gas   Electric    also owned by Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE    were issuing a   system wide curtailment watch  for the firms   non core  customers  including electrical generating stations and large commercial or industrial suppliers  In the statement  SoCalGas said it and SDG E are currently meeting system demands utilizing gas flowing in from interstate pipelines  plus the limited local storage facilities it has available  In a statement issued to reporters  the company said the loss of its Aliso Canyon storage facility has led to concerns by state regulators that the company would not have enough pipeline capacity and local storage to handle demand on very hot or cold days  Local electric companies use natural gas generators to supplement electric supplies  and state regulators last year had voiced concern about the potential for rolling blackouts  A limited program to resume some natural gas shortage at Aliso Canyon has been approved ",2017-01-23,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/opec-versus-shale-200173287,200173287

123723,345238,SRE,Cheniere s LNG Exports  Contrarian Indicator For Gas Prices ,opinion,"Cheniere Energy Inc  NYSE LNG  has long been my favorite contrarian indicator in the U S  natural gas market  For those unfamiliar with the term  a contrarian indicator is an event which suggests that a broadly and firmly held view in this case  the view that U S  natural gas supplies will grow and remain cheap for decades is about to begin a reversal 
As the company  of U S  liquefied natural gas  LNG  for export earlier this year  the glut of cheap U S  natural gas seem to vindicate Cheniere s plans  I  on the other hand  imagined that the shipment was not confirmation of Cheniere s assumptions  but a contrarian signal that natural gas production was about to dip and that prices were finally going to turn higher in a sustained way 
I say this based on the timing of Cheniere s last scheme  a U S  natural gas import terminal that now sits unused next to its newly built LNG export terminal in Louisiana  The import terminal received its first LNG shipment  just two months before U S  natural gas prices   collapsing to a low of  2 06 by September 2009  For comparison  last week U S  natural gas futures for September delivery closed at  2 59 
Cheniere s stock price went from above  40 in 2007 to around  3 by September 2009  having gone below  1 at one point  When Cheniere planned and built the import terminal  most everyone believed that U S  natural gas production would soon go into decline  But  only months after the terminal was operational  there was no longer any reason to bring LNG into the United States  It was just too expensive to compete with cheap domestic production which continued to grow 
So  Cheniere got the idea that it would reinvent itself as an LNG exporter  After all  because of the so called shale revolution U S  natural gas production was supposed rise for decades keeping U S  domestic gas cheap  The rest of the world  Europe and Asia especially  would be hungry for LNG supplies and would pay dearly for them 
That was then  Now  of course  LNG prices have collapsed because of worldwide over expansion of LNG capacity and flat demand in a world struggling to grow  Prices which had been above  11 in Europe and between  15 and  18 in Japan in 2012 while Cheniere was building its export terminal have now swooned to  4 51 in Europe and  6 in Japan  Even back in 2012 Cheniere s foray into LNG exports seemed like a  to me 
What s worse for Cheniere is that the first signs of a U S  natural gas production decline have appeared  Shale gas  the main driver of U S  production growth   That means that at some point supplies will shrink enough that U S  prices will rise and likely make the margin between the U S  price and European and Asian prices even smaller  And  as it turns out  the peak in U S  natural gas production  if it hasn t already 
I have not scrutinized Cheniere s financial statements  I do not know the structure of its debt  Nor have I studied the arcana of the company s existing contracts for delivery of LNG cargoes   that 87 percent of its capacity is under long term contracts where all the price risk is taken by the buyer  If Cheniere makes money  it will make money based on service fees 
With LNG prices as low as they are and a glut of new LNG facilities still planned  will other buyers from other new facilities take all the price risk which seems only to the upside  Will they insist on a more equitable sharing of that risk  Will the low spot price of LNG lead to more short term arrangements for the time being  These are all good questions for those contemplating an investment in LNG facilities 
An earnings report from Cheniere    missed estimates and may or may not indicate a problem  Famed short seller  who has no doubt done all the analysis I ve failed to do thinks the company has many problems 
In December of last year I suggested that one possible surprise in the year ahead was that several approved U S  LNG projects might be delayed or canceled  something that seemed unlikely at the time  In late July  Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  announced that it was  on whether to build an LNG export facility in Louisiana  Earlier in the month  the company announced  for a similar project in British Columbia 
Just last week Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE   in further work on an expansion of its Louisiana based LNG export operation 
Outside North America  and  show that the problem is worldwide 
Possibly making matters worse in the long run are  by pipeline from Russia to China starting in 2019 that might sell for around  10 to  11  If that becomes the ceiling price in China  LNG from the United States will almost surely be unable to compete for the large Chinese market 
Because Cheniere is taking no price risk on almost all of its exports  the company may make out just fine no matter what happens to U S  natural gas or world LNG prices   I leave it to the financial analysts to figure out  for instance  whether Cheniere s arrangement with Britain s BG Group  at 115 percent of the Henry Hub price plus a  2 25 per million BTUs liquefaction fee will provide adequate cash flow  
But  I m guessing that Cheniere s first exports of LNG will in hindsight likely mark a bottom for U S  natural gas prices just as its first imports of LNG nearly coincided with the top of the gas market in 2008  U S  natural gas production is likely to shrink in the coming years  and Cheniere is proposing to take more and more of that shrinking supply and export it  And so are   though I doubt that many of them will complete their projects  
The question for investors is whether U S  LNG operators will make money or simply destroy capital as Cheniere did in the past with its LNG import operations  The question for policymakers is whether shipping U S  natural gas abroad is a good idea even as the country continues to  to meet its needs  
                               
 It is a supreme irony the some U S  imports  in the form of LNG  almost certainly under long term contracts  Some of those imports arrived through Sabine Pass  Louisiana   the site of Cheniere s new LNG export facility  The lion s share of U S  imports  however  come  from Canada

123751,345266,SRE,3 Utilities To Bet On As Rate Hike Still Remains Uncertain,opinion,"The flurry of first quarter earnings releases has begun to ebb with nearly 89  of the S P 500 members having already released their numbers  The list includes most of the heavyweights across industries  It is time we draw investor attention to the highly regulated and defensive utility sector  Utilities generally render steady performances in all kinds of markets  Earnings growth for the S P 500 utility companies which have already released Q1 results is 10 2  as compared to 4 7  for the index  The U S  economy grew at a lower than expected rate of 0 2  during the first quarter of 2015 due to a stronger dollar  the decline in oil prices and a sluggish global economy  In this context  utilities have a more domestic focus and there is hardly any substitute for its services  Moreover  the utility industry is capital intensive and needs to access external sources of funds to expand its operations  The low interest rate environment  which has for sometime been near zero level  has been extremely conducive for its growth  With slowing economic growth and soft job additions in the first quarter  the Fed has in its latest statement last Wednesday retreated to a more dovish stance about interest rate hikes 
Apart from rate hikes and policy changes in Washington  the utility sector is also at the mercy of the weather Gods  Winter played a minor role during the first quarter of 2015  The quarter was up against difficult comparisons as the prior year period was hit by severe winter temperatures due to the polar vortex  which drove record demand for natural gas and electricity  The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  projects electricity sales to commercial customers to increase 1 7  in 2015 and 1 4  in 2016  Sales to industrial customers are expected to rise 1 3  in 2015 and 1 1  in 2016  While residential demand is expected to increase 1 8  in the rest of 2015  it is projected to decline 1 1  in 2016  On the back of rising demand  the EIA forecasts U S  electricity generation to increase by an average of 1 2  in 2015 and 0 6  in 2016  The average electricity rates across the U S  are also likely to increase in 2015  Investments to strengthen transmission and distribution infrastructure and usage of more renewable sources will primarily drive regulated utility rates  The combination of higher sales and unit prices makes a strong case for the utilities this year  The drop in oil prices since the second half of 2014 has created a stir among the oil export dependent economies  Since oil prices are expected to remain low over the best part of 2015  it will surely impact the oil export oriented nations  In addition  a weak euro zone and slower than expected recovery in China are bound to increase the domestic focus of the U S  investors  Apart from expanding their business organically  the players in the utility space are entering into strategic merger and acquisition  M A  deals  which lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  Three major players in this space  Exelon Corporation  NYSE EXC   NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  and Wisconsin Energy Corporation  NYSE WEC   are currently in the midst of M A deals that are expected to close in 2015 subject to all necessary approvals  The utility sector earnings in the first quarter 2015 are expected to grow at 8 5  on the back of a 0 3  improvement in total revenues  In comparison  earnings for the S P 500 group are expected to improve 1 6  from the same period last year on 3 3  lower revenues  As per the U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis  consumer spending in the U S  in the first quarter of 2015 increased to  11 173 1 billion from  11 119 6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014  In addition  as per HousingEconomics com  building permit in the U S  in the first three months of 2015 increased 9  year over year to 241 100  These point toward a likely increase in demand for utility services in the upcoming quarters  Given the uncertain markets abroad and the uncertainty over the domestic interest rates hike  focusing on the utility stocks  which have consistent dividend payment histories and share buyback programs  is a prudent step How to Select the Earnings Plays  Selecting the best stocks from the Electric Utility space may appear to be a daunting task  This is where we fall back on our proprietary methodology  It s fairly simple   stocks with the combination

123752,345267,SRE,Utility Industry Stock Outlook  CPK  DTE  SRE  WGL,opinion,Utilities play an important role in the economic system of any nation  They are also among the safest investment bets given the regulated nature of their business that gives their revenues a high level of certainty  They also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from the foreign currency translation issues that have been an issue for many other industries lately  Though demand for utility services like electricity  gas and water varies with the swings of the economy  the business fortunes for these companies don t vary to the same extent with the economy s cycles  After all  these companies providing basic services can never go out of business    this is their most basic fundamental strength  Their ability to pay consistent dividends makes them even more attractive  To provide an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities  utilities need to upgrade and strengthen their infrastructure and modernize the generation fleet  These modifications enable utilities to meet increasing demand and abide by stringent environmental regulations laid out by state and federal agencies The Environmental Challenge Utilities have long depended heavily on coal for generating a big part of their power  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  Celebrations of Earth Day and World Environment Day bring more focus on this issue but curbing pollution is an ongoing process  Utilities are installing smart meters  attaching scrubbers to lower emissions and launching energy efficiency programs to lower customers  energy consumption  Governments across the world are enforcing ever stricter rules and mandates to

123782,345297,SRE,Will FirstEnergy Overcome Comeptetive Marekts This Earnings Season ,opinion,"FirstEnergy Corporation  NYSE FE   a diversified energy company  is scheduled to release second quarter 2014 financial results before the market open on Aug 5  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4 88   Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
FirstEnergy operates one of the largest transmission networks in the U S  and systematically invests capital to improve its quality of services  In the second quarter  the company completed inspections and equipment maintenance drill at its operating subsidiaries to prepare for the summer months and ensure service reliability  As FirstEnergy operates in a competitive space  maintenance of quality is essential to retain and expand its customer base  A major portion of FirstEnergy s generating capacity comes from coal fired and nuclear power units  which expose the company to environment related regulatory risks  In the to be reported quarter FirstEnergy s subsidiaries Mon Power and Potomac Edison filed for a rate increase to the Public Service Commission of West Virginia  The rate request is for  103 million and the decision is expected to come by Feb 2015  Since the regulated operations comprise nearly 85  of FirstEnergy s business mix  the company depends on positive regulatory decisions to drive its modernization plan forward 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not show that FirstEnergy Corporation is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Negative Zacks ESP  That is because the Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 44 cents per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents  is  8 33  Zacks Rank  3  FirstEnergy Corporation carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Though a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of  8 33  indicates that FirstEnergy is going to miss earnings estimates 
Other Stocks to Consider
