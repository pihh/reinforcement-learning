117489,339004,J,Jacobs Engineering  J  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Jacobs Engineering  J  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction and technical services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 20 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  53 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 32 billion  up 7 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 04  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Jacobs Engineering 
For Jacobs Engineering  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 77  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Jacobs Engineering will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Jacobs Engineering would post earnings of  1 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of  15 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Jacobs Engineering doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jacobs-engineering-j-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200502379,200502379
117490,339005,J,ACM Vs  J  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Engineering   R and D Services sector might want to consider either Aecom Technology  ACM  or Jacobs Engineering  J   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Aecom Technology is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Jacobs Engineering has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ACM is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
ACM currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 93  while J has a forward P E of 16 95  We also note that ACM has a PEG ratio of 1 21  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  J currently has a PEG ratio of 1 50 
Another notable valuation metric for ACM is its P B ratio of 2  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  J has a P B of 2 23 
These metrics  and several others  help ACM earn a Value grade of A  while J has been given a Value grade of C 
ACM is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ACM is likely the superior value option right now ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acm-vs-j-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200503212,200503212

Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels

117527,339042,J,Transformed Portfolio To Aid Jacobs Amid Stiff Competition,opinion,Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   has been benefiting from focus on high value businesses and efficient project execution  Meanwhile  its strategic focus on transitioning from engineering and construction to a global technology forward solutions company is expected to facilitate Jacobs to drive growth Shares of Jacobs have rallied 45 4  year to date  comfortably outperforming the Zacks  industry s 21 8  growth  Its price performance is backed by an impressive earnings surprise history  The company   which shares space with Quanta Services  Inc    NYSE PWR    KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR   and Altair Engineering Inc    NASDAQ ALTR   in the same industry   surpassed earnings estimates in 10 of the trailing 12 quarters Earnings estimates for fiscal 2020 have been upwardly revised over the past few weeks  suggesting that sentiments on Jacobs are moving in the right direction  Notably  earnings estimates for fiscal 2020 have increased 2 9  over the past 30 days  reflecting its solid potential However  higher transaction related costs  stiff industry rivalry  and persistent headwinds in global energy and commodity markets remain concerns Let s delve deeper and find out the factors that substantiate its Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Key Growth DriversStrong Performance and Solid Backlog  Jacobs has been exhibiting strong results and the trend is expected to continue in the near term  courtesy of increased focus on new brands embracing innovation as connective foundation  Fiscal 2019 was a transformational year for Jacobs  It completed the divestiture of the Energy  Chemicals and Resources or ECR business in April  acquisition of KeyW in June  and announced the buyout of Wood s nuclear business in August  These moves were in sync with its strategic focus on transitioning from engineering and construction to a global technology forward solutions company Not only its results exceeded analysts  expectations  but also Jacobs registered stellar growth in fiscal 2019  Adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at  5 05 per share  reflecting an increase of 30  year over year  Revenues were  12 74 billion  increasing 20 4  from a year ago  Adjusted operating income increased 17  and adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points from a year ago  Adjusted EBITDA of  981 3 million increased 21 6  from a year ago  Overall  the company will see a robust pipeline of opportunities across all businesses  as it has started to realize synergies from CH2M and KeyW buyouts  Earnings estimates for the current year have increased 2 9  over the past 30 days  reflecting the stock s solid potential In a nutshell  the company s focus on providing strong technical expertise to mission critical sectors serving the U S  military warfighter and intelligence agencies bode well for growth and profitability  Also  its focus on higher growth and higher margin sectors like telecom 5G  data analytics  cybersecurity and C5ISR provide significant opportunities for growth  Solid backlog level is indicative of Jacobs  strong growth opportunities that lie ahead  Backlog at the end of fiscal 2019 was  22 57 billion  increasing 13 1  year over year  CMS backlog grew 18 7  year over year to  8 46 billion in fiscal 2019  Moreover  PPS backlog was up 10  year over year to  14 11 billion Inorganic Drive  Jacobs is reinforcing business on the back of meaningful business acquisitions  In sync with this  on Aug 20  2019  the company announced that it has entered into an agreement to buy John Wood Group s Nuclear business for an enterprise value of approximately  300 million on a debt free  cash free basis  This transaction is expected to close by the end of second quarter fiscal 2020  On Jun 12  2019  Jacobs acquired KeyW  The transaction positioned Jacobs as a leader in high value government services  Meanwhile  on Apr 26  the company completed the sale of the ECR business unit to Australia s WorleyParsons Ltd   as it intends to focus more on highest margin growth businesses ConcernsLow entry barriers in engineering  architectural  consulting and designing market segments have escalated threats of market rivalry for Jacobs  The company intends to underpin the business through increased business internationalization  However  constant appreciation of the U S  dollar with respect to other major currencies such as Euro and Yen might continue to hurt its overseas market revenues  as well as profitability  In fiscal 2019  approximately 29  of its fiscal 2019 revenues were earned from clients outside the United States Meanwhile  stretched valuation is a concern  On a P E  TTM  basis  Jacobs  stock looks a bit overvalued than the industry  with respective tallies of 17 5x and 15 4x in the past year  Notably  the stock is currently trading higher than the median P E  TTM  range The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires

117570,339085,J,Jacobs Engineering  JEC  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Jacobs Engineering  JEC  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction and technical services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 28 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  3 31 billion  down 20  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Jacobs Engineering 
For Jacobs Engineering  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 22  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Jacobs Engineering will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Jacobs Engineering would post earnings of  1 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 40  delivering a surprise of  12  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Jacobs Engineering appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jacobs-engineering-jec-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4-release-200486050,200486050

117574,339089,J,Quanta Services Or AECOM  Which Construction Stock To Bet On ,opinion,Undeniably  construction industry is gradually gaining steam  given recovery in the housing market and increased focus on fixing the country s infrastructure  Notably  U S  construction spending inched up in September  backed by government and private residential projects  per the latest report from the U S  Census Bureau Solid construction activities in the public sector  low interest mortgage rates  a solid job market and rising wages have helped the Zacks  sector to gain 39 2  so far this year  outperforming the broader market s  S P 500  22 8  rally Given this backdrop  construction stocks could offer a safe haven to investors because of their stability and the fact that these are fundamentally strong enough to withstand industry woes Here  we focus on two companies from the Zacks  industry falling under the broader Construction space   Quanta Services  Inc    NYSE PWR   and AECOM   NYSE ACM    At present  market capitalization of Quanta Services is  6 01 billion  while that of AECOM stands at  6 7 billion Before drawing a head to head comparison between Quanta Services and AECOM  let s check out a few key statistics of the companies YTD Stock PerformanceAECOM and Quanta Services  which share space with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   and Gates Industrial Corporation PLC   NYSE GTES   in the same industry  have gained 60 1  and 38 7   respectively  so far this year  The Engineering   R D Services industry has gained 39 2  during the period  Hence  AECOM fared much better than Quanta Services in this parameter  ValuationThe industry is clearly undervalued compared with the S P 500  with respect to forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future  The industry has an average forward 12 month P E ratio   which is the best multiple for valuing Engineering   R D Services stocks   of 14  which is below the S P 500 s average of 17 9  Hence  it might be a good idea to focus on stocks belonging to this particular industry Coming to the two stocks under consideration  AECOM   with a 12 month forward P E ratio of 12 6   is undervalued than the S P 500 and the industry  Quanta Services  with a 12 month forward P E ratio of 10 9  is also less pricey than both the S P 500 and the industry Comparing the two stocks  Quanta Services is less pricey than AECOM Earnings Growth Projections   SurprisesAnalysts expect AECOM s earnings to grow at a 9 3  rate over the next three five years  Comparatively  Quanta Services  earnings are expected to grow 14 5  over the same time frame  Hence  Quanta Services  higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation AECOM and Quanta Services  year over year earnings growth is expected to be 20 4  and 20 7   respectively  in 2020 Hence  Quanta Services is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectation Meanwhile  considering a more comprehensive earnings history  both AECOM and Quanta Services surpassed estimates thrice in the last four quarters  That said  AECOM has a superior average positive earnings surprise of 4 94  than Quanta Services  negative surprise of 9 09  in the said period Profitability and ReturnsProfitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company s business and growth opportunities  Return on Capital  ROC  of AECOM is 5 6   while that of Quanta Services and the industry is 8 6  and 9 9   respectively  This signifies that Quanta Services  business generates a higher return on investment than AECOM s Return on Equity  ROE  is a measure of a company s efficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds  ROE in the trailing 12 months for AECOM and Quanta Services is 10 3  and 12 2   respectively  While Quanta Services has outpaced the industry level of 10 5   AECOM has failed to surpass the same in the said period Zacks RankWhile Quanta

117605,339120,J,Can Jacobs Engineering  JEC  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Jacobs Engineering  JEC   which belongs to the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this construction and technical services company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 10 59   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Jacobs Engineering came out with earnings of  1 40 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 25 per share  representing a surprise of 12   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 09 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 19 per share  delivering a surprise of 9 17  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Jacobs Engineering  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Jacobs Engineering currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 97   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 25  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-jacobs-engineering-jec-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200479174,200479174

9  in the third quarter  compared with a 5 4  drop in the second  Revenues are projected to increase 1 6   versus flat growth in Q2  For a quick flashback  the third quarter 2019 results of sector

Consensus Estimate despite a slowdown in activity levels What s Working in Favor Construction companies are expected to come up with a strong third quarter 2019 show  attributable to growth in public sector construction activity  mainly in large transportation projects and contract work for highways  A significant number of project awards across multiple segments  including communications  transmission and power  and infrastructural projects in domestic as well as international markets along with strong pricing are likely to have contributed to growth  Again  increasing defense spending in major economies like the United States  rising public investment in water infrastructure and utility plants as well as encouraging prospects in the healthcare market might have favored construction companies in the quarter Meanwhile  the housing market  which has borne the brunt of rising interests mortgage rates and higher raw material costs since the end of 2017  has regained momentum on a declining mortgage rate trend  The industry players are expected to have gained from solid household formation attributable to declining mortgage interest rates  steady economic growth and favorable demographics In a nutshell  the housing market rebound and Trump s drive to enhance the country s infrastructure by upgrading highways  railroads  bridges and broadband are expected to have benefited the players  bottom lines in the quarter under review Without any doubt  construction companies have for long been grappling with trade war driven increase in raw material costs  rising freight expenses  higher incentives to drive sales and volatility in commodity prices  These along with higher land labor costs might have weighed on margins of many companies in the construction space  thereby hurting bottom lines to some extent Which Are the Right Picks Despite higher input costs and trade tensions  the construction space looks attractive on solid infrastructure activity

117650,339165,J,Acuity Brands  AYI  To Post Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Acuity Brands  Inc    NYSE AYI   is slated to announce fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Oct 2  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company delivered mixed results  wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 2  but sales missed the same by 2 3   Notably  its earnings grew 6 8  on a year over year basis on the back of improved sales  higher price realization and productivity gains  despite ongoing inflationary cost pressures and the impact of tariffs The company delivered positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing five quarters  The trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter as well How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been downwardly revised by 1 4  over the past seven days to  2 80  This indicates a 4 5  increase from the year ago earnings of  2 68 per share  Revenues  however  are expected to decline 3 1  year over year to  1 03 billion  Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise    Factors at PlayAcuity Brands is poised to benefit from the diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy efficient luminaries  Again  strategic buyouts and joint ventures for expansion of its geographic borders and product portfolio are expected to aid the top line Acuity Brands has been undertaking various cost reduction initiatives like price increase  These initiatives are likely to benefit its bottom line in the to be reported quarter  The company believes that fiscal fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin will exceed from the prior year level and improve on a sequential basis On the contrary  the lighting industry has witnessing weak demand for luminaries over the last few quarters in the United States and this is expected to impact the upcoming quarterly results as welll  Particularly for larger non residential lighting projects  the company has been witnessing weak demand  which is expected to result in tepid top line growth in the to be reported quarter  Distributors have been reporting lower than expected sales growth  thanks to weather  labor shortages and slow activity of large projects  This is also likely to hamper the quarter to be reported The company expects fiscal fourth quarter net sales to be down modestly from the year ago period  Also  its efforts to boost margin profile may hamper top line growth Additionally  higher input cost of electronic and certain oil based components  along with freight and commodity related items   particularly steel prices   are likely to put pressure on the company s overall results in the to be reported quarter What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model suggests that Acuity Brands is likely to beat estimates in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

expectations in 13 of the last 14 quarters  while revenues topped estimates in 12 of the trailing 14 quarters Its second quarter revenues and earnings grew 23 1  and 21 1  year over year  respectively

117702,339217,J,Near Term Outlook Bleak For Engineering R D Services Stocks,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily consists of engineering and infrastructure service providers  The companies basically provide construction  technical  engineering and professional services to a number of industries worldwide  including oil and gas  chemical and petrochemicals  transportation  mining and metals  power  agriculture  consumer applications and manufacturing Some of the prominent players in this industry are Quanta Services  NYSE PWR   Inc   PWR   Jacobs Engineering Group Inc  NYSE JEC    JEC   KBR  Inc   KBR   Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR   FLR  and AECOM  ACM  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is poised to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States that require state of the art construction and engineering services  The Trump administration s push to boost infrastructure spending is another vital growth catalyst for the industry  Also  the space is poised to gain from the rapid usage of advanced technologies to deliver smart buildings and mega projects  while identifying and checking diminishing margins as well as reducing costs  The Trump administration s investment in defense and cyber security is conducive to the industry s growth  The players are also gaining from rising global demand for alternative nuclear energy  as they provide engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance services to nuclear power plants  Meanwhile  increasing public investments in transportation  water infrastructure  utility plant and healthcare market are anticipated to drive the industry s growth  Chemical derivative and refining opportunities  both domestic and international  along with upstream and LNG opportunities should also spur growth  However  a tight labor market  trade war induced rise in raw material costs  volatility in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the industry s commodity based business lines pose significant challenges  Again  significant cost overruns  as prices of several companies  contracts are fixed  have been hurting the bottom line of some of the companies  Increasing competition is another dampener  The industry faces intense competition in the global engineering  procurement and construction industry  which is detrimental to the companies  contract prices and profit margins Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Engineering   R D Services industry is a 17 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  229  which places it at the bottom 10  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates dismal near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since March 2019  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down by approximately 17 8   Earnings estimates for 2020 have also moved 16 2

year For the next three years  through 2021   management has projected new margin targets as the company remains confident about the recent backlog trends  Jacobs aims at 125 175 bps expansion of adjusted operating margins in the long run  The updated guidance anticipates 100 150 bps increase in ATN margins and 110 140 bps growth in BIAF margin  supported by the elimination of ECR  which will lead to a 125 175 bps rise in overall margins This upbeat view is mainly attributable to a combination of higher margin backlog  and its focus on generating efficiencies through digital and

117772,339287,J,Jacobs Engineering  JEC  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Jacobs Engineering  JEC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction and technical services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 25 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 15 billion  down 24 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 47  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Jacobs Engineering 
For Jacobs Engineering  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Jacobs Engineering will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Jacobs Engineering would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 19  delivering a surprise of  9 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Jacobs Engineering appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jacobs-engineering-jec-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200446482,200446482

are expected to be  2 89 billion  suggesting 8 8  increase from the year ago reported figure Factors at PlayQuanta Services is expected to generate higher earnings and revenues in the second quarter  given strong base business activity and ramped up construction activities in larger pipeline projects Solid backlog levels in end markets served  three pronged growth strategy focusing on timely delivery of projects to exceed customer expectation  leverage on core business to expand in complementary adjacent service lines and the ongoing momentum of exploring new service lines are likely to aid Quanta Services  upcoming quarterly result The company sees acquisitions as a fundamental component of its strategy to boost market share and develop incremental backlog  This bolt on acquisition strategy is anticipated to boost top line growth in the quarter to be reported Let s Delve Deeper Into Segmental DiscussionQuanta Services remains optimistic about end market prospects of both the segments  namely Electric Power and Oil   Gas Its Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment  which contributed 59 3  to first quarter revenues  has been riding high on modest revenue growth and solid margin expansion  backed by outstanding execution of a large transmission project  This is likely to benefit the quarter to be reported as well However  the company expects second quarter margins from the electric segment to be the lowest in the year  due to shift in project revenues owing to seasonality The communications business  part of its Electric Power segment    which contributed more than 50  to revenue growth in 2018   is anticipated to post improved results in the to be reported quarter  Prospects of the segment remain robust  given customers  investment in grid modernization programs to accommodate a changing fuel generation mix toward natural gas and renewables  intended to address the aging infrastructure  strengthen systems for resiliency against extreme weather conditions and support long term economic growth Markedly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s second quarter revenues is pegged at  1 800 million  implying growth from  1 664 million in the last reported quarter and  1 570 million a year ago  Backlog in the segment is expected to be  7 915 million  up from  7 135 million a year ago Quanta Services  Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment  40 7   looks equally promising  The solid prospect is primarily owing to improving mainline and natural gas distribution  and integrity markets  The company expects strong performance from pipeline projects  given healthy levels of base load work  including midstream infrastructure support  downstream support services and natural gas distribution  This is in turn expected to boost profitability in the second quarter Sales and margins are expected to improve in the quarter to be reported  aided by the above mentioned tailwinds  and ongoing improvement in gas distribution and base businesses Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s second quarter revenues is currently pegged at  1 125 million  up from  1 086 million reported in the year ago period  Backlog in the segment is currently anticipated to be  4 382 million  implying an increase from  4 358 million reported in the prior year What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not

117777,339292,J,Jacobs  JEC  To Report Q3 Earnings  Is A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2019 results on Aug 5  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 2  but revenues missed the same by 1 4   Notably  its earnings from continuing operations increased 37  from the year ago figure  backed by strong revenues and margins  Jacobs  revenues also grew 7 7  from the year ago quarter Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported has declined from  1 26 to  1 25 over the past 30 days  This indicates a decrease of 7 4  from the year ago earnings of  1 35 per share  Moreover  revenues are expected to be  3 15 billion  suggesting a 24 3  year over year decline Factors to ConsiderJacobs  fiscal third quarter earnings are likely to decline on lower revenue expectation  Jacobs expects a moderation in top line growth in the second half of fiscal 2019 based on strong first half results and tough comps  Notably  with the completion of the ECR sale and the KEYW acquisition  the portfolio transformation appears to be largely complete Jacobs s Aerospace  Technology and Nuclear or ATN segment  comprising 34 3  of total second quarter fiscal 2019 revenues  is likely to benefit from the U S  federal government s increased focus on defense  energy  intelligence community and NASA  Highly fragmented nature of the government services market  its strong technical expertise  unique localized delivery model and an industry leading efficient cost structure will certainly contribute to its revenues and profits The Buildings  Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities or BIAF segment is well positioned to deliver positive results  given favorable infrastructure spending  In the U K   multi year programs such as the Environment Agency s TEAM2100 and Highways England s Routes to Market   a six year program to transform England s motorways   bode well for Jacobs  The water business is expected to benefit from a major water upcycle in the United States  Within transportation  aviation continues to be strong in the United States and Asia  This is another positive for the to be reported quarter Overall Earnings   Revenue PictureModerate revenue generation is expected to be offset by prudent cost management and improved project execution that will likely support the company s bottom line to some extent in the to be reported quarter  Its efforts toward increasing the share of higher margin backlog  and dependence on recurring revenues and rebid wins are expected to give a boost to its bottom line Meanwhile  the company expects to incur some of the one time ECR related transaction  separation and restructuring costs in the fiscal third quarter  It also expects about  16 million of transaction fees and one time acquisition related costs in the quarter What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Jacobs Engineering has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while ROTORK PLC has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that JEC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than RTOXY has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
JEC currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 77  while RTOXY has a forward P E of 22 68  We also note that JEC has a PEG ratio of 1 48  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  RTOXY currently has a PEG ratio of 1 81 
Another notable valuation metric for JEC is its P B ratio of 2 05  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  RTOXY has a P B of 5 21 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to JEC s Value grade of A and RTOXY s Value grade of C

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if JEC is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this construction and technical services company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For JEC  shares are up 0 38  over the past week while the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 26  compares favorably with the industry s 1 61  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Jacobs Engineering have risen 9 33   and are up 26 59  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 29  and 9 96   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to JEC s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  JEC is currently averaging 928 252 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with JEC 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost JEC s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 69 to  4 70 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that JEC is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Jacobs Engineering on your short list ",2019-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-jacobs-engineering-jec-is-a-great-choice-200438029,200438029

117817,339332,J,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Jacobs Engineering  JEC ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Jacobs Engineering  JEC  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this construction and technical services company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Jacobs Engineering is 6 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 5 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 5 1  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Jacobs Engineering is 59 7   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 6  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 5  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Jacobs Engineering have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Jacobs Engineering has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Jacobs Engineering is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-jacobs-engineering-jec-200438865,200438865

117855,339370,J,Lower Selling Price To Hurt KB Home s  KBH  Q2 Earnings,opinion,KB Home   NYSE KBH   is scheduled to report second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 26  after market close  In the last reported quarter  its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 8  but revenues missed the same by 2 2   Notably  the company topped earnings expectations in each of the trailing 13 quarters Although the bottom line witnessed a positive surprise trend over the last several quarters  the metric declined 22 5  year over year in the fiscal first quarter  Its top line also decreased 6 9  year over year  The company has been experiencing lower average selling price   ASP   of homes delivered  and reduced net orders and backlog value of late Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release KB Home Price and EPS Surprise   For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 60 days at 39 cents per share  This indicates a decrease of 31 6  from the year ago earnings of 57 cents per share  Revenues are also expected to decline 15 1  from the prior year quarter to  934 75 million Factors at PlayRevenues  Post torrid second half of 2018  the overall homebuilding industry has been suffering from lower revenues  order and backlogs  This notable homebuilder had a slower start to fiscal 2019  These headwinds are likely to hamper its performance in the fiscal second quarter as well Due to declining order and backlog trend  KB Home expects fiscal second quarter housing revenues to decline in the range of  900  950 million from  1 091 8 million reported in the year ago period  ASP is anticipated within  375 000  380 000  below the prior year figure of  401 800 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s homebuilding revenues  representing 99 7  of the total revenues   including housing and land  is pegged at  933 million compared with  1 098 7 million reported in the year ago period Margins  Rising labor costs and land prices are likely to threaten KB Home s margins in the to be reported quarter  The company expects fiscal second quarter housing gross margin in the range of 17 17 6   assuming no inventory related charges   Considering the mid point of the guided range  the metric is marginally higher than the year ago figure of 17 1   However  the same suggests a decline of 30 basis points from fiscal first quarter gross margin of 17 6   owing to regional and community mix impacts related to expected quarterly deliveries SG A expenses  as a percentage of housing revenues  are expected in the range of 12 3 12 9  compared with 10 4  reported a year ago  This is indicative of the impact of lower revenues  additional marketing expenses  the ASC 606 reclassification  and the absence of legal recoveries and favorable legal settlements Although KB Home s Built to Order approach and Returns Focused Growth Plan will provide considerable support to the bottom line  lower revenues and margins  along with higher SG A expenses will have a negative impact on the to be reported quarter Homebuilding operating margin  excluding the impact of any inventory related charges  in the to be reported quarter is expected between 4 2  and 5 2   much lower than 7 3  registered in the prior year quarter  What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that KB Home is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for KB Home is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 39 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  KB Home currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  Note that

117856,339371,J,Will Lennar  LEN  Be Able To Top Q2 Earnings Estimates ,opinion,Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   is slated to report results for second quarter fiscal 2019  ended May 31  before the opening bell on Jun 25 In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 3  and 5 3   respectively  Nonetheless  this Miami based homebuilder surpassed earnings expectations in four of the five trailing quarters How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged at  1 13 per share over the past 60 days  This indicates a decrease of 28 5  from the year ago earnings of  1 58 per share  Revenues are also expected to decrease 6 3  year over year to  5 11 billion Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key FactorsLennar is expected to report improved quarterly results than the fiscal first quarter  given lower mortgage rates  rebounding western markets and ongoing demand for affordable housing by multiple demographic groups  Notably  as California home sales are trending in a positive direction  Lennar is expected to benefit from higher volume and average selling prices Homebuilding  Robust backlog position and increased traffic on the back of improved consumer confidence  wage growth as well as lower mortgage rates are expected to be conducive to the company s revenues It expects deliveries in the to be reported quarter within 11 700 12 000 units compared with 12 095 units reported a year ago  Average sales price is expected between 400 000 and 405 000 versus  413 000 in the year ago period and  410 000 in the last reported quarter The company expects new orders in the 14 000 14 300 range compared with 14 440 in second quarter fiscal 2018 For the to be reported quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s Homebuilding segment revenues  accounting for 93 7  of total revenues  is pegged at  4 803 million  suggesting a decrease from  5 064 million in the year ago period but an increase from  3 624 million in the last reported quarter  This sequential improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and deliveries  Lennar is expected to gain from its dynamic pricing model that will enable it to price homes according to the current market conditions as they evolve From the margins perspective  Lennar expects fiscal second quarter gross margin in the range of 20 20 5   compared with 20 1  in the fiscal first quarter   Increase in the average sales price is expected to be partly offset by higher construction costs Indeed  labor shortages  higher construction costs  limited land availability  and increases in new and existing home sale prices have been hurting the homebuilding industry for quite some time now  Lennar is not an exception in this regard  Higher construction and land costs have been creating pressure on the company s gross margin over the last few quarters Nonetheless  Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG A  selling  general and administrative  line  owing to operating leverage and investments in technology  SG A expenses  as a percentage of home sales  are estimated within 8 5 8 6  compared with 8 7  a year ago and 9 5  in the fiscal first quarter For the Financial Services segment  the consensus estimate for the segment s revenues is pegged at  207 million  implying a decrease from  232 million in the year ago period but an increase from  143 million in first quarter fiscal 2019 What the Zacks Model UnveilsLennar does

Estimate of  2 50 by 1 2  and increasing 6 8  on a year over year basis  backed by improved sales  higher price realization and productivity gains  despite continuing inflationary cost pressures and the impact of tariffs Notably  adjusted earnings excluded the impact of amortization expense of acquired intangible assets  share based payment cost  acquisition related items  special charges for streamlining activities  and excess inventory adjustments related to the closure of a facility SalesNet sales during the fiscal third quarter came in at  947 6 million  missing the consensus mark of  970 million by 2 3   However  the reported figure increased 0 4  year over year  The upside was attributed to more than 1  increase in sales volume  partly offset by unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and the adoption of ASC 606  Meanwhile  contribution from acquisitions  net of divestitures  remained flat year over year in the quarter  Again  impact from product price mix changes was flat year over year as higher pricing was offset by changes in the mix of products sold and customer mix within certain channels  Acuity Brands Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit margin declined 110 basis points  bps  to 40 5  on a year over year basis  Yet  third quarter adjusted gross margin exceeded the 40  mark for the first time in a year and improved sequentially for the third quarter in a row  Higher sales and realized price  and benefits from productivity improvements were offset by a shift in key customers  changes in sales channel mix and increased input costs Adjusted selling  distribution and administrative or SD A expenses   constituting 26 2  of net sales   improved 90 bps from the year ago quarter  The upside was attributable to a decrease in freight and commission expense Adjusted operating margin came in at 14 3   down 20 bps year over year FinancialsCash and cash equivalents  as of May 31  2019  were

infrastructure in order to achieve its pre determined target of achieving higher margins and overall profitability Shift in sales among key customers within the retail channel is expected to continue

to boost margin  the company initiated a review of a small portion of its product portfolio and services offering  and aims to eliminate items that do not meet its return objectives Meanwhile  Acuity

117898,339413,J,Engineering R D Services Industry s Near Term Outlook Dismal,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily consists of engineering and infrastructure service providers  The companies basically provide construction  technical  engineering and professional services to a number of industries worldwide  including oil and gas  chemical and petrochemicals  transportation  mining and metals  power  agriculture  consumer applications and manufacturing Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is poised to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States that require state of the art construction and engineering services  The Trump administration s push to boost infrastructure spending is another vital growth catalyst for the industry  Also  the industry is poised to gain from the rapid usage of advanced technologies to deliver smart buildings and mega projects  while identifying and addressing diminishing margins  These technologies have been helping firms achieve operational efficiencies  thereby reducing costs while improving margins  The Trump administration s investment in defense and cyber security is conducive to the industry s growth  The players are also gaining from rising global demand for alternative nuclear energy  as they provide engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance services to nuclear power plants  Meanwhile  increasing public investments in transportation  water infrastructure  utility plant and healthcare market are anticipated to drive the industry s growth  Chemical derivative and refining opportunities  both domestic and international  along with upstream and LNG opportunities should also drive growth  However  a tight labor market  trade war driven rise in raw material costs  rising freight expenses  volatility in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the industry s commodity based business lines pose significant challenges  Again  significant cost overruns  as prices of several companies  contracts are fixed  have been hurting the bottom line of some of the companies  Increasing competition is another dampener  The industry faces intense competition in the global engineering  procurement and construction industry  which is detrimental to the companies  contract prices and profit margins Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Engineering   R D Services industry is a 16 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  163  which places it at the bottom 35  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates dismal near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 35  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since October 2018  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down by approximately 8 8  Despite the industry s gloomy near term view  we will present a few stocks that one can hold on to  Before that  it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation Industry Underperforms S P 500  Outperforms SectorThe Zacks Engineering   R D Services industry has lagged theZacks S P 500 composite but outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector over the past year Over this period  the industry has gained 5 1  versus the broader sector s decline of 4 8   Meanwhile  the S P 500 has gained 8 1  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing building products stocks  the industry is currently trading at 13 2X versus the S P 500 s 17 2X and the sector s 14 2X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 16 9X  as low as 9 9X and at the median of 13X  as the chart below shows Industry s P E Ratio  Forward 12 Month  Versus S P 500 Bottom LineA major boost in infrastructural and construction spending should continue to favor the industry s performance  Advanced construction and engineering services along with prudent cost management practices should provide support  However  rising transportation and raw material costs are pressing concerns Below we present four stocks from the Zacks Engineering   R D Services space that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Investors might also prefer holding another

Technology and Nuclear   ATN   segment to the Buildings  Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities   BIAF   segment  This restatement is likely to make difficult comparisons Jacobs  fiscal second quarter is likely to benefit from solid end market demand and transformed business portfolio  From an end market perspective  the company remains well positioned  given the U S  federal government s increased focus on defense  energy  intelligence community and NASA  Jacobs  largest contracts are aligned to mission critical areas within the federal budget and hence are less discretionary in nature  Given the highly fragmented nature of the government services market  its strong technical expertise  unique localized delivery model and an industry leading efficient cost structure will certainly contribute to top and bottom line growth The company expects elevated defense spending in major economies like the United States  new organic investments  bolt on acquisitions  superior customer relationships and sturdier demand for state of the art technology solutions to boost revenues from the ATN line of business The BIAF segment is well positioned  given favorable infrastructure spending  In the U K   multi year programs such as the Environment Agency s TEAM2100 and Highways England s Routes to Market  a six year program to transform England s motorways  also bode well for Jacobs  Asia Pacific demand is underpinned by strong public investment in rail and other infrastructure investments  The water business is expected to benefit from a major water upcycle in the United States  Within transportation  aviation continues to be strong in the United States and Asia Encouraging Earnings ScenarioOverall  stellar top line performance of the aforementioned segments  prudent cost management and improved project execution are expected to have reinforced the company s bottom line performance in the to be reported quarter Its efforts toward increasing the share of higher margin

117958,339473,J,PWR Vs  JEC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Engineering   R and D Services stocks have likely encountered both Quanta Services  NYSE PWR  and Jacobs Engineering  JEC   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Quanta Services has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Jacobs Engineering has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PWR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
PWR currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 01  while JEC has a forward P E of 14  We also note that PWR has a PEG ratio of 1 25  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  JEC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 45 
Another notable valuation metric for PWR is its P B ratio of 1 43  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  JEC has a P B of 1 72 
These metrics  and several others  help PWR earn a Value grade of A  while JEC has been given a Value grade of C 
PWR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than JEC  so it seems like value investors will conclude that PWR is the superior option right now ",2019-03-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pwr-vs-jec-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200396412,200396412

118032,339547,J,Solid Backlog   Government Business To Aid KBR s Q4 Earnings ,opinion,KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 26  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings came in at 46 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents by 18   However  revenues lagged the same by 23 6   Nonetheless  KBR  which share its space with Altair Engineering Inc    NASDAQ ALTR   and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   in the Zacks  industry  surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with average positive surprise of 12 6  KBR  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Its third quarter revenues grew 23 6  and adjusted earnings surged 31 4  on a year over year basis  Strong organic growth from Government Services and Technology businesses  solid execution across all segments  accretive growth from Aspire and SGT  along with buoyant government contracting and hydrocarbons end markets led to the upside How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at 37 cents per share  remaining stable over the past 60 days  This reflects an increase of 32 1  from the year ago earnings of 28 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  1 25 billion  up 33  year over year Factors at PlaySolid contribution from Government Services and Technology businesses is likely to benefit KBR s fourth quarter results The company s continuous growth in overseas logistics and mission support programs  given higher military exercise activities  will help it to post higher fourth quarter revenues  Moreover  all the key markets are likely to benefit the company  with expected growth in the United States  U K  and Australia  on the back of continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects KBR s Government Services unit or GS  which accounts for more than 72  of the total revenues  has been performing pretty well over the last few quarters  Notably  more than 80  of the total backlog represents work in the Government Services  KBR s high end and differentiated work under the GS segment is definitely a positive  Also  its overseas logistics and mission support programs  with higher military exercise activity  increased outsourcing of sustainment activities by the military and the ramp up of new wins  add to the positives The company s Hydrocarbons Services or HS unit is expecting some decent opportunities in ammonia  petrochemical and refining  which will boost growth of the segment  As of Sep 30  2018  the segment reported a backlog of approximately  1 9 billion  of which more than  1 8 billion was generated at the end of 2017  KBR believes that the healthy balance between hydrocarbons and government projects positions it well for future growth KBR s Technology business has been performing well in recent times  This is driven by refining and petrochemicals projects in China  India  and Africa  as well as strong technology demand  In the last reported quarter  the segment recorded 35  organic growth and a record backlog of  544 million  which was up 95 7  from the prior year level However  the company s domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressure  In order to keep itself updated about state of the art construction procedures  the company requires huge capital

118073,339588,J,Jacobs Engineering  JEC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Jacobs Engineering  JEC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction and technical services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  36 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 81 billion  up 38 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Jacobs Engineering 
For Jacobs Engineering  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 28  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Jacobs Engineering will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Jacobs Engineering would post earnings of  1 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 31  delivering a surprise of  7 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Jacobs Engineering doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jacobs-engineering-jec-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200381225,200381225
118074,339589,J,Jacobs  JEC  To Post Q1 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 6  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings came in at  1 31 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 by 7 4   while revenues lagged the same by 2 5   In fact  Jacobs surpassed earnings estimates in eight of the trailing 10 quarters How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at  1 05 per share  remaining stable over the past 30 days  Nevertheless  this reflects an increase of 36 4  from the year ago earnings of 77 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  3 81 billion  up 38 7  year over year Jacobs Engineering Group Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayJacobs  fiscal first quarter is likely to benefit from solid end market demand and transformed business portfolio  From an end market perspective  the company remains well positioned given U S  federal government s increased focus on defense  energy  intelligence community  and NASA  Jacobs  largest contracts are aligned to mission critical areas within the federal budget and hence are less discretionary in nature  Additionally  given the highly fragmented nature of the government services market  its strong technical expertise  unique localized delivery model  and an industry leading efficient cost structure will certainly contribute to top and bottom line growth Meanwhile  post the sale of Energy Chemicals and Resources or ECR business  which is likely to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2019  Jacobs intends to provide higher value sustainable and digitally enabled solutions for infrastructure and government clients worldwide That said  investors should note that the fiscal first quarter is seasonally regarded as the lowest growth quarter for Jacobs  given the winter aspects associated with the quarter Meanwhile  the company expects elevated defense spending in major economies like the United States  new organic investments  bolt on acquisitions  superior customer relationships and sturdier demand for state of the art technology solutions to boost revenues of the Aerospace  Technology  Environmental and Nuclear or ATEN line of business  Overall  Jacob s ATEN business is executing well and is positioned to deliver profitable growth in fiscal 2019 The company s BIAF segment is well positioned  given favorable infrastructure spending  In the U K   multi year programs such as the Environment Agency s TEAM2100 and Highways England s Routes to Market  a six year program to transform England s motorways  also bode well for Jacobs  Asia Pacific demand is underpinned by strong public investment in rail and other infrastructure investments  The water business is expected to benefit from a major water upcycle in the United States  Again  within transportation  aviation continues to be strong in the United States and Asia Overall  stellar top line performance of the aforementioned segments  along with prudent cost management and improved project execution are expected to have reinforced the company s bottom line performance in the to be reported quarter What Does the Zacks Model Say Our proven model does not conclusively show that Jacobs is likely to beat estimates in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the

118106,339621,J,Why Jacobs Engineering  JEC  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Jacobs Engineering  JEC   which belongs to the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this construction and technical services company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 13 54   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Jacobs Engineering was expected to post earnings of  1 19 per share  but it reported  1 35 per share instead  representing a surprise of 13 45   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 88 per share  while it actually produced  1 per share  a surprise of 13 64  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Jacobs Engineering  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Jacobs Engineering has an Earnings ESP of  4 47  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 20  2018 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-jacobs-engineering-jec-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200360605,200360605

118110,339625,J,Jacobs  Focus On Higher Margin Line Of Businesses Bodes Well,opinion,Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   is poised to gain from healthy segmental businesses  accelerated CH2M cost savings along with strong operational execution  Meanwhile  increased focus on higher margin line of businesses  namely Aerospace  Technology  Environmental and Nuclear   ATEN   and Buildings  Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities   BIAF    will help Jacobs to boost profitability in the coming quarters This construction and technical services company has outperformed its year to date  The outperformance is backed by an impressive earnings surprise history  The company surpassed earnings estimates in eight of the past 10 quarters and the trend is likely to continue in the near term as well  as is evident from strong fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 results Recently  Jacobs ended fiscal 2018 on a strong note  Adjusted earnings of the company came in at  4 47 per share  reflecting an increase of 38  year over year  Revenues were  15 billion during the year  increasing 49 5  from fiscal 2017  Moreover  adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points  Key Growth DriversJacobs is benefiting major government customers across the Department of Defense  Department of Energy  intelligence community and NASA  The company derived 23  of fiscal 2018 revenues  directly or indirectly  from agencies of the U S  federal government  Meanwhile  within its commercial markets  the 5G wireless build out continues to provide robust opportunities  Importantly  the company s ATEN business is executing well and is positioned to deliver double digit increase in profits on a year over year basis in fiscal 2019  These positives are likely to continue driving Jacobs  bottom line in the upcoming quarters  Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s earnings of  5 28 per share for fiscal 2019 reflects 18 1  year over year growth Revenues from the ATEN line of business  accounting for 31 4  of its total revenues  increased 100 3  year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter  This uptrend mainly stemmed from a number of long term enterprise contract wins from the U S  government  including the Missile Agency and Special Operations Command  which created a strong base of recurring revenues for the company  Backlog at the end of the quarter was roughly  8 86 billion for the segment  up 39 3  year over year Meanwhile  the company s other higher margin line of business  BIAF  also delivered stellar quarterly results  This business contributed 40 7  to its quarterly revenues and the top line advanced by a solid 67 6  as a result  A constant need to upgrade the living infrastructure  driven by major trends of urbanization and population growth  has created a robust pipeline of global opportunities for the BIAF segment   Jacobs is also reinforcing business on the back of meaningful business acquisitions  Its CH2M HILL Companies Ltd   CH2M  buyout  completed last December  has been driving strong growth  Through the CH2M buyout  Jacobs foresees to accrue cost synergies worth nearly  175 million  even after Energy  Chemicals and Resources or ECR sale  on exiting fiscal 2019  Notably  in October 2018  the company agreed to offload its ECR business unit to Australia s WorleyParsons Ltd   as it intends to focus more on highest margin growth businesses HeadwindsLow entry barriers in engineering  architectural  consulting and designing market segments have escalated threats of market rivalry for Jacobs  Also  the company intends to underpin its business through increased business internationalization  In fiscal 2018  approximately 36  of its revenues were earned from clients outside the United States  However  constant appreciation of the U S  dollar  with respect to other major currencies  might continue to hurt its overseas market revenues as well as profitability  This is because a strengthening dollar raises the prices of the company s construction services  subsequently rendering them less competent in markets with relatively lower exchange rates Zacks Rank   Key PicksCurrently  Jacobs carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector include KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR    Altair Engineering Inc    NASDAQ ALTR   and EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

strength of Government Services businesses to optimize its growth potential Organically  sales grew 12  in the third quarter  following a 11  increase in both the second and first quarter in the Government Services business  Ongoing growth in KBR s overseas logistics and mission support programs with higher military exercise activities  increased outsourcing of sustainment activities by the military and the ramp up of the new wins led to the growth  Moreover  higher tasking for various missile defense and other military priorities in its engineering business areas  under select IDIQ contracts  also led to the upside Meanwhile  KBR s Technology segment  contributing 6 3  to the total revenues  has generated 35  sales growth  on an organic basis  in the third quarter  The company continues to experience strong demand for petrochemical  refining and agricultural technologies  driven by availability of competitively priced feedstock combined with increasing global development  expanding consumer demand and increasingly stringent environmental policies Strong Backlog   Upbeat Views  KBR s backlog level of  13 5 billion  as of Sep 30  2018  highlights its underlying strength  Notably  more than 80  of KBR s backlog represents work in the Government Services  Majority of these Government Services are long term reimbursable service annuity type contracts that have significantly lower risks than some of its other projects  The company believes that this will ultimately help in margin expansion and considerably de risking the business  Despite a slow backlog in Hydrocarbons  KBR generated 1 1x book to bill in the third quarter  reflecting faster turnaround projects in Government Services Meanwhile  buoyed by strong year to date performance  KBR raised its

margins in each of the second as well as the third quarter of 2018  supported by these two acquisitions  It remains optimistic about the prospects of both the buyouts  mainly on account of increased government spending across space and defense  Last year  the company completed several strategic acquisitions  including two established and highly technical government services companies  It also acquired a specialty welding and turnarounds company through Brown   Root joint venture Superior ROE  KBR s return on equity   ROE   supports its growth potential  The company s ROE of 13 4  compares

118137,339652,J,JEC Vs  WEGRY  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Engineering   R and D Services sector might want to consider either Jacobs Engineering  JEC  or WEIR GROUP PLC  WEGRY   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  Jacobs Engineering has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while WEIR GROUP PLC has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that JEC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than WEGRY has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
JEC currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 04  while WEGRY has a forward P E of 18 10  We also note that JEC has a PEG ratio of 1 17  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  WEGRY currently has a PEG ratio of 1 45 
Another notable valuation metric for JEC is its P B ratio of 1 86  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  WEGRY has a P B of 2 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to JEC s Value grade of B and WEGRY s Value grade of C 
JEC sticks out from WEGRY in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that JEC is the better option right now ",2018-11-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jec-vs-wegry-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200357588,200357588

118142,339657,J,Jacobs Engineering  JEC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Jacobs Engineering  JEC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction and technical services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 21 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 24 billion  up 59 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Jacobs Engineering 
For Jacobs Engineering  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Jacobs Engineering will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Jacobs Engineering would post earnings of  1 19 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 35  delivering a surprise of  13 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Jacobs Engineering doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jacobs-engineering-jec-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200358768,200358768

 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  the metric slumped 43 5  on a year over year basis due to the decline in revenues and effect of high non operating charges that trickled down

million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 775 million  The top line also plunged 33 3  year over year  This lackluster performance was largely as a result of revenue declines across most of the company s segments Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   In the full year  revenues were down 22 1  year over year to  6 7 billion  The decline can be primarily attributable to decrease in revenues at the Engineering   Construction and the Fabrication Services segments  Backlog for the company came in at  11 4 billion at the end of 2017 compared with  13 billion at the end of 2016 Fourth quarter gross profit rose 9 3  year over year to  84 7 million while gross margin expanded by 120 basis points to 5   The improvement in margins was driven by a steep

came in at  5 8 billion  reflecting an increase of 17  year over year  thereby reflecting the company s strong competitive position in refining and petrochemical markets Segmental RevenuesThe company

activities in the quarter came in at  909 4 million  a turnaround from the net cash generated from operating activities of  654 5 million in the comparable period last year Major DevelopmentsIn December 2017  Chicago Bridge   Iron and McDermott   NYSE MDR   agreed to merge in an all stock deal worth about  6 billion  thus creating an extensive engineering  procurement  construction and installation company  The combined company will be completely vertically integrated and is likely to offer end to end engineering  procurement  construction and installation services to the onshore and offshore energy sectors  The agreement is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 Per the contract  McDermott s shareholders will own 53  of the combined entity while the remaining stake will be owned by Chicago Bridge   Iron s shareholders  Notably  the deal is expected to be cash accretive  excluding one time costs  within the first year after its closure  In 2019  both the companies are expected to generate annualized cost synergies of  250 million and sizeable revenue synergies in addition to Chicago Bridge   Iron s  100 million cost reduction program    Furthermore  in December last year  the company decided not to proceed with the sale of its Technology business  reclassifying the business under continuing operations in the reported quarter To ConcludeChicago Bridge   Iron anticipates multiple opportunities in its key end markets including the U S   East Africa and the Middle East  For the U S  and Middle East  solid petrochemical investment on ethylene

118355,339870,J,5 Low Leverage Stocks To Buy Amid Rate Hike Woes,opinion,Debt financing is a common practice among corporates to ensure smooth operations and business expansion  This is because depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is impracticable Although companies may raise capital through equity financing  debt financing has always been a favored choice  While debt financing brings with it the liability of interest payment  it provides funding at lower rates than equity financing  especially in periods of historically low interest rates  Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible Yet  debt financing has its drawbacks  Since too much debt increases the cost of capital for the company  bearing huge debt tends to shoot up the company s risk of bankruptcy  especially in times of economic crisis With the Federal Reserve having raised their benchmark interest rate last December and two more hikes expected by analysts this year  the debt scenario does not seem very favorable for U S  stocks The fact that only a fortunate few can avoid taking debt  should not dissuade investors from betting on stocks  Instead  a prudent investor will try to pick stocks that are less financially leveraged as companies with high debt load are risky options And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which have been constructed historically to save investors from debt traps  The debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s credit worthiness  for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a better investment pick With the Q4 reporting cycle about to begin  investors will tend to target stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth But choosing stocks that boast earnings growth only might not be a wise investment strategy  A higher degree of leverage can turn an attractive investment option into a nightmare in times of financial crisis The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have

118362,339877,J,5 Low Leverage Stocks To Save Your Portfolio From Debt Traps,opinion,In corporate finance  leverage is a well known business strategy adopted by companies  to borrow funds to finance working capital requirements  acquisitions or for some kind of business expansion  Now  the two most common financial resources corporates resort to are debt and equity  Interestingly  a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity  as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity  especially in periods of low interest rates  This happens because when a company finances its operations with debt  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a fixed time period Whereas  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well  Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible Yet  debt financing has its drawbacks  The problem arises when the amount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant  Especially  at times of high interest rates  companies with large debt loads become more prone to bankruptcy That said  for the investor  the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he she is investing has a sustainable debt level  since a debt free corporation is rare to find  Therefore  the debt level of a company is an important point of consideration while making  an investment decision  Several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company s credit level to support prudent equity investments  The most popular among them is the debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a better investment pick With the Q4 reporting cycle in full swing by now  companies reflecting high earnings growth should be ideal investment choices  However  such growth stocks may also be highly leveraged ones Since a greater cohort of investors is risk averse by nature  it is reasonable to expect that they will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an

118372,339887,J,AECOM s  ACM  Q1 Earnings  Revenues Beat Estimates  Up Y Y,opinion,"AECOM   NYSE ACM   reported first quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents  Also  the bottom line increased 7 5  from the year ago tally of 53 cents  The improvement was primarily attributable to the company s impressive top line performance 
Revenue Performance
For the fiscal first quarter  revenues increased 12 7  to  4 910 8 million on a year over year basis  Moreover  revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 585 million 
Further  the company achieved 8  organic growth in the fiscal first quarter that reached to a new all time high  The continued strong performance of Building Construction and Power business proved favorable for the top line AECOM Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Segment wise  Design   Consulting Services  DCS  revenues rose 5 5  year over year to  1 941 9 million  Also  on a constant currency basis  organic revenues increased 5  on the back of strong performance in the company s transportation and water markets in the Americas  The transportation and water markets were driven by improved funding as well as continued growth across international markets 
Construction Services  CS  revenues increased 21 4  to  2 125 5 million on a year over year basis  On a constant currency basis  organic revenues were up 11   Stellar performance of this segment was driven by Building Construction and Power businesses 
On the other hand  Management Services  MS  revenues registered an impressive year over year growth of 9 9  to  843 4 million  It also grew 10  on an organic basis  reflecting strong business momentum 
However  AECOM s adjusted operating income in the fiscal first quarter was  158 1 million  down from the year ago tally of  188 2 million  New order wins in the quarter totaled  6 1 billion  Also  AECOM s total book to burn ratio during the quarter was 1 2   with significant contribution from the DCS  CS and MS segments

2018 Guidance
AECOM reiterated its fiscal 2018 guidance  The company continues to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of  2 50  2 90 
In terms of spending  the company continues to project to incur interest expense  excluding amortization of deferred financing fees  of  210 million and capital expenditures of  110 million 
Our Take
AECOM s first quarter 2018 results have been quite impressive  with substantial growth in both top and bottom line performance  Record backlog and accelerating revenue growth proved conductive to the company s growth 
Moreover  the company s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services  The company is also efficient in dealing with cyclical market volatility that helps it capitalize on the upside of its business during downturns  More than 70  of AECOM s profits are generated from infrastructure and defense markets that are poised to benefit from the favorable political climate  both in the United States and abroad 
However  cyclical demand of the company s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth  going forward  This apart  the company believes that economic conditions in many of its end markets  including Canada  China and the Middle East  have weakened over time and may remain difficult in the near future 
AECOM carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks to Consider
A few better ranked stocks in the same space include Boise Cascade  L L C    NYSE BCC    Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC    While Boise Cascade sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Lennar Corporation and Jacobs Engineering Group carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Let s take a look at a stock which has very good chart support coming up for a potential trade  The name of the company is Jacobs Engineering Group Inc  NYSE JEC   This stock has been selling off since late January when it traded as high as  63 42 a share  Today  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc stock is trading at  53 48 a share  This is obviously a significant pullback in the share price of JEC stock  So where is the buy level for JEC stock since it has declined so much  Well  this is when we want to look at the weekly chart to see if the there is technical reason for a bounce higher or for the selling to stop  The first thing that traders should note on the weekly chart is that the 200 weekly moving average sits at  50 62 a share  This level also happens to coincide with the November 2016 breakout  Now this is what a technical chart reader would call institutional sponsorship  This trade level is where I would be a buyer of JEC stock  Now  patiently wait for the equity to trade down to the  50 62 area on the chart 
Institutional traders and investors will generally support stocks and markets at these prior breakout levels  This same technique can often be applied on multiple time frames for day trading  swing trading and investing  Obviously  you will and should test this method first  but with some practice you will find this tactic to be extremely useful when trading all equities ",2017-04-14,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buying-past-breakout-levels-to-make-money-200182907,200182907

While cost saving initiatives proved conducive to bottom line growth  tepid top line performance proved to be a drag 
For fiscal 2016  the company s earnings were  3 08 per share  well within the guided range of  2 90  3 20  However  it declined 5 5  from the fiscal 2015 figure 
Revenues
Revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter decreased 15 3  year over year to  2 640 6 million and also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 779 million 
Dismal sales in three out of four segments of the company resulted in the weak top line performance  Economic headwinds in key end markets proved to be a major drag on the company s sales 
For fiscal 2016  the company s total sales came in at  10 964 2 million  down 9 5  from fiscal 2015  Significant market challenges in fiscal 2016 played a spoilsport

   Outlook
For fiscal 2017  the company believes that cost savings from its restructuring actions and constant reinvestment in strategic growth initiatives will act as key growth drivers  Over the past few quarters  Jacobs has successfully trimmed general and administrative costs and improved receivables collection performance  which  in turn  have proved conducive to growth in cash flows  This trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2017 as well 
However  on the flip side  the company anticipates macroeconomic headwinds  such as strengthening of the U S  dollar and weakness in the global commodity   energy markets  will continue to hurt its revenues and earnings performance 
Based on the current market scenario  Jacobs projects fiscal 2017 earnings to lie within the range of  3 00  3 30 per share 
To Conclude
Jacob s lackluster fiscal 2016 results are largely attributable to macroeconomic woes  Going forward  we believe that the company s diligent cost saving and restructuring initiatives will help it combat some of the macroeconomic weaknesses  During fiscal 2016  the company implemented a global realignment into four lines of business 
These initiatives have resulted in greater accountability and improved project execution  The company remains bullish on efficient cost structure  end market diversity and focus to drive margins  These will prove conducive to profitability growth in fiscal 2017 
Despite these strengths  energy market woes have significantly thwarted the company s growth prospects and are proving to be a drag on its financial performance  Depressed oil prices are directly weighing on oil companies  sales and hence  significantly reducing the extent of Greenfield investments made within the sector  Moreover  weak global economic growth projections have dragged down commodity and construction service prices  thus adding to the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s woes

Greater degree of industrialization in contemporary economies has enhanced the extent of construction activities  This  in turn  has been raising the demand for Jacobs  services  The company also aims to improve its profitability with the help of strategic restructuring programs and cost saving schemes

Bearish Aspects
Persistent weakness in the global energy sector and commodity prices has been weighing over Jacobs  aggregate revenues  Moreover  constant appreciation of the U S  dollar with respect to other major currencies  such as Euro and Yen  continues to hamper the company s international trade

118613,340128,J,KBR Reports In Line Earnings On Lower Top Line  Stock Down,opinion,Shares of premium technology  engineering  procurement and construction company  KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR   sank 4 1  on Jul 29  following a tepid second quarter 2016 earnings performance KBR broke its beat streak that ran for five consecutive quarters  as its second quarter adjusted earnings of 32 cents met the Zacks Consensus Estimate   Meanwhile  the earnings figure tumbled 25 6  compared with the year ago tally of 43 cents  However  there was a  28 million pre tax gain on the sale of a non strategic business which boosted earnings in second quarter 2015 KBR s bottom line performance was driven by strong operational execution and strength in Technology and Government Services business  However  overall weakness in top line proved to be a drag Inside the HeadlinesRevenues fell 26 9  year over year to  1 009 million  owing to absence of revenues from the deconsolidation of certain businesses in 2015  Also  low oil prices have been restricting the capital spending by clients which in turn compounded the top line decline  Also  revenues lagged the consensus mark of  1 024 million Segment wise  Technology   Consulting revenues continued to be strong and were up 22 5  year over year to  98 million on the back of increased proprietary equipment sales and inorganic revenue growth from previously completed acquisitions Additionally  Government Services revenues charted phenomenal growth as it soared nearly 45  to  229 million on a year over year basis  Revenues benefited from the solid expansion of existing U S  government contracts and task orders in support of the U S  Military  The company reached an agreement with the U S  government regarding reimbursement of  33 million in legal fees related to the sodium dichromate legal disputes However  Engineering   Construction revenues continued their weak trajectory  and deteriorated 34 8  year over year to  621 million  Reduced activities in a major LNG project and several other projects as they approach completion hurt segmental revenues  Also  deconsolidation of KBR s Americas Industrial Services business proved to be a major headwind Also  non strategic business revenues plummeted 67 9  year over year to  98 million owing to lower revenues from two recently completed power projects as well as divestiture of the Building Group business in second quarter 2015 As of Jun 30  2016  the company s total backlog stood at  11 billion  down 8 2  on a year over year basis  Of the total backlog  about  6 4 billion is booked under the Government Services segment  down 7 4  on a y o y basis  and around  4 2 billion under the Engineering   Construction segment  down 8 3  on a y o y basis   While Technology and Consulting accounted for  394 million of the backlog  down 8 6  on a year over year basis   non strategic Business had  100 million in backlog  down 39 4   Significant DevelopmentsConcurrent with the earnings release  KBR declared that it is on track to exceed its planned target of annual cost savings in 2016  as it has already identified more than  200 million of the target at the end of second quarter 2016  Furthermore  the company is strategically pursuing its restructuring activities and has incurred  12 million in pre tax restructuring costs during the quarter Also  sale of assets associated with certain Corporate real estate assets during the quarter helped the company garner  2 million in pre tax gains  Going forward  KBR plans to continue with its portfolio restructuring actions and thereby channelize resources specifically into the International Government Services and Global Hydrocarbons segments to maximize profits In addition  the quarter saw KBR win two contract extensions with the U S  Department of Defense  as well as a multi year services contract for the Australian Defense Department Wyle AcquisitionOn Jul 1  KBR closed the  570 million acquisition of California based Wyle Inc    a provider of specialized engineering and technical services The firm delivers an extensive range of revolutionary  differentiated solutions  and caters primarily to the U S  Department of Defense  NASA and other federal agencies  Wyle will function within KBR s government services segment under the name  KBRwyle   thus retaining the legacies of both the companies The acquisition will help expand KBR s government services capabilities and service offerings  enabling the company to reduce its reliance on the hydrocarbon market  In addition  over the long term  Wyle is set to unlock synergistic opportunities in markets where KBR can combine its large scale logistics and project management capabilities with Wyle s expert technical capabilities In addition to creating the equivalent of a global  2 billion government services organization  the acquisition also enhances KBR s overall risk profile by enabling it to leverage higher margin and largely cost reimbursable work through other government funding sources  KBR anticipates Wyle to be immediately accretive to its earnings and generate a positive cash flow Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Jun 30  2016  KBR s cash and equivalents were  804 million  down from  883 million as of Dec 31  2015 For the quarter  cash flow generated from operating activities during the quarter totaled  9 million  compared with cash generation of  20 million in the prior year quarter Guidance ReiteratedKBR has reiterated its guidance for full year 2016  The company expects earnings per share within  1 20 to  1 45  excluding legal costs associated with the legacy U S  government contracts  The guidance includes contribution from KBRwyle for the second half of 2016  which will likely add between  0 05 and  0 08 per share  Legal costs are projected at around  15 million or  0 11 per share for 2016 KBR INC Price and EPS Surprise   Our TakeDespite weak performance this quarter  KBR s ability to sustain its earnings growth over the past few quarters bears a testimony to the company s diligent restructuring actions  Going forward  KBR believes that its Government Services will keep acting as a strong growth driver as it continues to enhance technical knowhow and advance support services to intelligence agencies  The Wyle acquisition will further KBR s relationships with U S  government clients and expand its footprint in the space Overall  the company s lucrative contract wins and its ability to execute large scale logistics and project management services efficiently adds to its strength and is expected to boost its financials  In addition  the company s capital allocation strategies and partnerships are expected to propel growth in the forthcoming quarters Despite these positives  KBR s precipitous revenue decline over the past few quarters owing to macroeconomic concerns are putting the company s financials under pressure  Also  the slump in oil prices are compounding the challenges for the hydrocarbons markets  thereby thwarting top line performance KBR currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better ranked stocks in the broader sector include Jacobs Engineering Group Inc

118615,340130,J,Fluor  FLR   Q2 Earnings Miss  Revenues Top  View Narrowed,opinion,Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR   posted its third consecutive earnings miss  as its second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents by 17 2   The figure fared even worse in year over year comparison  having fallen 28  from the prior year tally of  1 00 per share   Additionally  concurrent with the bleak market scenario  Fluor narrowed its 2016 full year guidance  leaving investors disappointed  These adverse developments led to a sharp 7 9  drop in the shares of the company in the after hours trading following the earnings release The bottom line decline was primarily on account of significant top line contraction in the Energy  Chemicals and Mining segment Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenue inched up 1  year over year to  4 856 1 million  also managing to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 712 million  The considerable fall in revenues in the Energy  Chemicals   Mining segment of the company was more than offset by improvements in the other three segments  thereby resulting in the lackluster top line performance During the quarter  the company announced plans of implementing a change in the reporting segments in order to better reflect the diverse end markets of the company  The company has condensed its business lines into four segments  namely  Energy  Chemicals   Mining  Industrial  Infrastructure   Power  Maintenance  Modification   Asset Integrity and Government from the previous Oil   Gas  Industrial   Infrastructure  Government  Global Services and Power  The company started reporting under these four segments from the first quarter of 2016 Revenues from the Energy  Chemicals   Mining segment continued to plummet  falling 24 1  year over year to  2 476 4 million  Softness in mining activities and forecast revisions on two projects proved to be an overhang Industrial  Infrastructure   Power segment s revenues posted another solid quarter  with revenues soaring 73 9  year over year to  1 010 million  Sales of this segment largely benefited from solid execution activities on nuclear and gas fired power projects Revenues at the Government segment were up 9 1  year over year to  657 9 million  mainly on account of profitable project wins and execution Maintenance  Modification   Asset Integrity revenues almost doubled  up 96 1   to  711 8 million on a year over year basis  This segment largely benefited from the recent Stork buyout that boosted sales at the Global Services unit  which was somewhat offset by weakness in the equipment business line For the reported quarter  Fluor s new awards were up 50 7  to  6 4 million on a year over year basis  Orders in the Government segment totaled  1 2 billion  task orders for LOGCAP IV  Orders at the Industrial  Infrastructure   Power segment were  3 4 billion  including the Purple Line Project in Maryland and the Greensville combined cycle power plant in Virginia Orders in the Energy  Chemicals   Mining segment totaled  1 2 billion  and included a  500 million bauxite mine in Guinea  Also  Maintenance  Modification   Asset Integrity segment recorded awards totaling  644 million Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter was  47 3 billion  up from  41 6 billion in the year ago quarter  The upside in backlog levels came on the back of large awards won in infrastructure and government business lines Liquidity   Shares RepurchasesAs of Mar 31  2016  Fluor had cash and marketable securities  including non current  of  1 915 9 million  down from  2 367 6 million as on Dec 31  2015  Long term debt rose to  1 547 5 million from  986 6 million as on Dec 31  2015 2016 GuidanceIn light of the persistent softness in the Energy  Chemicals and Mining segment  Fluor has narrowed its full year 2016 guidance  as the company s revenues are expected to take a beating on account of this formidable headwind  Currently  the company projects earnings per share for 2016 in the range of  3 25 to  3 50  previous range   3 25  3 65 per share  FLUOR CORP NEW Price and EPS Surprise   Our TakeGoing forward  we believe Fluor s solid track record of winning awards is a major positive that will drive revenues and margins  Also  the company s strong backlog levels hint at bright days ahead especially for the government and infrastructure business lines  This apart  the company s strong financial position  diligent restructuring initiatives and strong foothold in the U S  engineering and construction sector are expected to boost growth However  on the flip side  softness in commodity prices coupled with a dismal outlook for the energy and mining markets pose threats that can significantly impede the company s top line growth  Also  the company expects continued slow recovery in the global economy  as customers continue to reduce capital investment budgets and delay final investment decisions  This could impact Fluor s future performance adversely Fluor currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Better ranked stocks in the same space include Willdan Group  Inc

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

3 Engineering Stocks to Watch for Thursday

Having moved past the halfway mark  we now have enough data to paint a meaningful picture of the first quarter earnings season  and draw a valid inference about the companies yet to report 

A large number of companies have reported positive surprises for both earnings and revenues  undoubtedly aided by easy to beat estimates and a waning greenback 

The expectations bar was apparently set exceptionally low this time around  with the first quarter having seen record negative estimate revisions  Consequently  out of the 310 companies on the S P 500 index that have released their quarterly results  about 71 9  have posted positive earnings surprises   Data from the  report dated Apr 29  2016  

However  the ground reality remains that soft macroeconomic growth has driven projections of an earnings decline for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  In fact  Industrial Products sector s Q1 earnings are now expected to be down 23 4  year over year  on 9 4  lower revenues 

In fact  we have already seen sub standard reports from a number of major players in the sector  such as Ball Corporation     NYSE BLL    

Overall  we now have Q1 results from 71 8  of the sector s market capitalization in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these industrial products companies are down 24 1  year over year on 9 3  lower revenues  with 64 7  beating EPS and revenue estimates 

However  there are many sector majors that have posted striking earnings beats as well  Eaton Corporation plc     NYSE ETN     for posted impressive earnings 

Let s have a look at how three engineering companies from the sector  slated to report earnings tomorrow  are poised ahead of the scheduled announcements 

Quanta Services  Inc      NYSE PWR    provides specialty contracting services to the electric power  and oil and gas industries  Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of  18 18  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 22 cents 

Quanta Services has had a choppy earnings history recently  with earnings beating estimates twice and missing once in the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 3 9   Last quarter  it beat estimates by 8  

Quanta Services has been contending with challenges like harsh weather events  project delays and sudden shifts in small transmission market dynamics  Also  macroeconomic factors like oil   gas volatility  consumer spending constraints and strengthening of the U S  dollar are expected to hurt its first quarter 2016 results   Read more    

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc      NYSE JEC    provides technical  professional  and construction services to a range of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients  Jacobs has an Earnings ESP of  17 39  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 69 cents 

The company has posted decent earnings in recent times  beating estimates in three of the four trailing quarters  while missing in one  resulting in an average beat of 10 1  

Jacobs  to be reported results are expected to benefit from an increased demand from Aerospace   Technology and PharmaBio markets  However  the company continues to grapple with capital spending constraints of clients and currency issues  which adversely impact its operations   Read more    

Fluor Corporation     NYSE FLR    delivers engineering  procurement  construction  maintenance  EPCM   and project management to governments and clients in diverse industries Fluor has an Earnings ESP of 2 33  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 86 cents 

The company has had a lacklustre earnings history  managing to beat earnings estimates just once in the last four quarters while missing in the other three  resulting in a negative average surprise of 6 7  

However  in the upcoming report  we expect Fluor s operations to benefit from its impressive contract wins as well as the recent uptick in the company s LNG business  Also  its recently acquired Dutch engineering and construction company Stork Holding will likely boost the company s sales   Read more

The Markets

Stocks ended lower on Wednesday as investors reacted to the release of the minutes from the latest FOMC meeting  Despite noting that market expectations for the first increase in the federal funds rate  was pushed out from the third quarter of 2015 to late 2015   few clues were offered as to the precise timeframe in which tightening would occur  The minutes expressed concern about the near term decline in inflation below the committee s 2  goal as a result of the decline in energy prices  which may persist for some time  However  the committee anticipates that inflation will trend towards its 2  target over the longer term  Inflation expectations remain a key variable in the Fed s dual mandate that may alter the committee s readiness to increase rates over the next six to twelve months  given that these expectations may be providing a better gauge of demand for people  materials  and product in the economy   Looking at inflation expectations via the Treasury Inflation Protected ETF  TIP  relative to the 7 10 year Treasury Bond Fund  ARCA IEF   the ratio is testing long term support  having recorded significant declines since 2011 when QE2 concluded  The latest quantitative easing program clearly did not have the same impact as the first two  leaving the Fed s hands tied from any immediate action  Further declines in inflation below levels of support could lead to a test of levels last seen in 2009  potentially destabilizing the economic recovery as investors lose faith in the central bank  Momentum indicators for the ratio between the Inflation Protected fund and the Intermediate T Bond Fund recently rebounded from the most oversold levels since 2009  possibly suggesting short term downside exhaustion  Inflation expectations are often important in fuelling commodity market trends  particularly Gold  which is also trying to find a footing around present levels   Inflation seasonally declines in the last quarter of the year 



While on the topic of commodities  Natural Gas prices surged on Wednesday as investors bet on cold winter weather given the deep freeze that is covering large parts of the US and Canada  The price of the commodity is once again attempting to break and hold above its 200 day moving average  benefitting from positive seasonal influences that typically begin in September  The seasonal trend peaks in December  just as the winter season officially begins  The 50 day moving average of the energy commodity recently curled higher  suggesting an emerging positive intermediate trend  which  if it holds  should allow for higher prices through the remainder of the period of seasonal strength  Support is apparent at this intermediate average 





Stocks have achieved an unprecedented rally since the October low  a rebound more akin to significant market bottoms  such as March of 2009  The strength of the rebound has fuelled gains for the S P 500 Index above its 5 day moving average for 24 sessions  the longest stretch in over 20 years  Twenty four trading sessions exceeds the previous longest timespan over the last two decades of 23 days  which ran between June 17 to July 20 of 1998 and another that ran between October 30 to December 2 of 1996  The conclusion to the rally on July 21st of 1998 led to a correction of over 20  during the months that followed  while the rally that ended on December 3 of 1996 led to a correction of around 5   which lasted only a couple of weeks  Looking back even further  the recent rally is just the fourth time in the past 60 years that the large cap benchmark has held above this short term moving average for at least 24 trading days  The record remains at 26 trading days  which ran between January 24 and March 3 of 1986  As of Wednesday s close  the 5 day average sat at 2044 20  a break of which would likely be the first step in a retracement of the month old advance in equity prices 







Sentiment on Wednesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 93
