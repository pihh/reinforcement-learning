34333,255848,MIDD,Here s Why It Is Worth Holding On To Middleby  MIDD  Stock Now,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on The Middleby Corporation   NASDAQ MIDD   on Nov 22 The company  with a market capitalization of  6 4 billion  currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   It specializes in manufacturing cooking  warming  food preparation and packaging equipment  especially meant for use in industrial processing  commercial and residential markets Many tailwinds and headwinds are impacting its performance  Let s delve deeper  Factors Favoring MiddlebyOperating Conditions  The company operates through three segments   Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group  Food Processing Equipment Group and Residential Kitchen Equipment Group Middleby anticipates acquired assets  expansion in international businesses and effective marketing initiatives to aid Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group   Also  it expects technologically advanced products and solutions as well as the increasing adoption of ventless cooking equipment to be beneficial In addition  Residential Kitchen Equipment Group will likely gain from Viking products as well as focus on product introductions and residential showrooms  Product launches and innovation investments might aid Food Processing Equipment Group  Buyouts  Middleby has been benefiting from acquired assets  In 2018  it added Hinds Bock  Ve Ma C  Firex  Josper  Taylor  M TEK  Crown Food Service Equipment and EVO buyout assets to its portfolio Middleby acquired Cooking Solutions Group of Standex International Corporation   NYSE SXI   in April 2019  Since then  the buyout has been fortifying Middlebys  portfolio of cooking products  In the same month  the company acquired Powerhouse Dynamics  adding more value to its Connect IoT platform Thereafter  Middleby bought Ss Brewtech in June and Packaging Progressions in July  Recently  the company acquired Brava Home  The buyout is expected to expand Middleby s product offerings in residential and commercial markets  Earnings Estimate Trend  The company reported better than expected results in the third quarter of 2019  with earnings surpassing estimates by 5 52   Its average earnings surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 3 03  Going forward  the company stands to benefit from the focus on product innovation  improving selling techniques  solid offerings to customers and focus on growth markets  Also  various profitability actions will likely be beneficial Earnings estimates for the company have been raised in the past 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Middleby s earnings is pegged at  6 74 for 2019 and  7 43 for 2020  suggesting growth of 3 4  and 1 2  from the respective 30 day ago figures The Middleby Corporation Price and Consensus    Factors Working Against MiddlebyShare Price Performance  The company s shares underperformed the industry  reflecting that market sentiment seems to be working against it  In the past three months  its shares have gained 6 6  compared with the  s growth of 12 9  Also  Middleby s shares currently seem overvalued compared with the industry  using the EV EBITDA  TTM  valuation method  The stock s three month EV EBITDA multiple is 13 18x  higher than the industry s 13 08x  Also  the stock is currently trading higher than the industry s three month multiple of 13 13x  This makes us cautious about the stock  Top Line Weakness  The company s third quarter 2019 top line performance suffered from the absence of large customer orders within the meat processing business  difficult conditions in the U K   primarily related to the Brexit  and weakness in the domestic appliance business For 2019  Middleby remains wary of certain headwinds  It expects weak spending by restaurant chains and Brexit related issues to hurt its Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group  Also  woes related to meat processing might affect Food Processing Equipment Group  and international uncertainties might hurt Residential Kitchen Equipment Group Costs  Forex and Debts Woes  Rising costs and expenses have been affecting Middleby for quite some time now  In the third quarter of 2019  the company s costs of sales increased 0 4  year over year  and selling  general and administrative expenses grew 2 2   Notably  material cost inflation  on account of tariffs  was a spoilsport though pricing actions came in as a relief Further  international diversity exposed the company to geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  In the third quarter of 2019  forex woes adversely impacted its sales growth by 1 1   Also  the company has a highly leveraged balance sheet  with long term debt of  1 955 9 million at the end of third quarter 2019 Persistence of such issues might be concerning for the company  Stocks to ConsiderTwo better ranked stocks in the same industry are Tennant Company   NYSE TNC   and Dover Corporation   NYSE DOV    While Tennant sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Dover carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at present  You can see  In the past 60 days  earnings estimates for both companies have improved for the current year  Further  average

34566,256081,MIDD,Middleby  Shedding The Fat And Growing Strong,opinion,"One way to look for investments is to look for something that astonishes you  The Middleby Corporation s  NASDAQ MIDD  evolution over the last 25 years astonished us  Over the period  the sales grew by 22x  profits rose at a much higher rate  balance sheet strengthened considerably  while the returns on equity increased to a stunning 23  
Then comes curiosity  What changed in this business after 1999 
Context  Middleby s History
Middleby was founded in 1888 by Joseph Middleby and John Marshall to produce custom portable ovens for the baking industry  Till it was acquired by TMC Industries in 1983 in a leveraged deal  it produced baking ovens and had a strong brand backed by patents  After the acquisition  it entered into the conveyor oven business for the pizza industry which became quite popular among the fast food pizza chains  And then  in 1989  it again took significant debt to acquire the Foodservice Equipment Group of Hussmann Corp for  63 million  with a strategy of becoming a diversified kitchen equipment manufacturer  The acquisition gave it strong brands  Southbend  Toastmaster  etc  and gave it entry to multiple industry lines like refrigeration  core cooking  holding and serving systems  etc  This was followed by another acquisition in the Philippines in 1990 to enter the international market  Middleby also had a manufacturing division in the Philippines  and a distribution arm which catered to global clients by offering sourcing set up of kitchen equipment  The acquisitions stretched the balance sheet again and the company spent the next few years trying to repair itself 
A company can either grow strong or grow fat  and Middleby grew fat  In the late 1990s  Middleby had five separate divisions within the company and 10 000 product lines  with the strategy of becoming a one stop shop for commercial kitchen equipment  mixers  ovens  toasters  refrigeration  serving stations  etc 
Then Selim Bassoul joined the business 
Shedding The Fat And Growing Strong
Selim  who worked for 8 years in the commercial food equipment for Premark Inc  joined Middleby in 1996  Subsequent to his joining the firm  the focus shifted to becoming lean  The company made a strategic decision of focusing on only the profitable lines in the cooking and warming segment and decided to exit all other segments 
From 1996 to 2000  the business was rationalized aggressively by the exit from non core segments like mixers  refrigeration  etc  and consolidating the organizational structure into two divisions  and a reduction in employee count   Middleby exited its low margin   unprofitable businesses and decided to refocus on profitable segments only  where they had and could build on their competitive advantage  The result was that by 2000  while sales remained stagnant  market share in the core segments rose  margins improved  debt was reduced and the company was considerably more efficient  It created a new  simple bonus structure which reduced employee turnover from as high as 40  to less than 10   and employee to supervisor ratio rose from 25 1 to 90 1 

Middleby shed most of the fat it had accumulated from 1989 to 1996 and decided to focus initially on the cooking or warming segment  So in 2000  Middleby was only in a single segment focusing primarily on commercial food equipment  conveyor oven  convection oven  fryer  steam cooking  toaster  counterline cooking and warming equipment  It had a few brands like Middleby  CTX  Southbend and Toastmaster 
And now in 2016  it is in three synergistic and growing segments 
Commercial food service equipment  55  of revenues   Ovens  toasters  fryers  etc  More than 30 leading brands include Middleby Marshall  Turbochef  Blodgett  etc 
Food processing equipment  15    batch ovens  breading machines  food packaging machines  etc  13 brands including Alkar  Rapipak  MP  etc 
Premium residential equipment  30    kitchen equipment for the residential market  Brands include Viking  AGA  etc 
Middleby s evolution from a single segment focused company  with less than 5 brands to a multi segment entity with more than 50 brands was driven primarily by acquisitions  Given acquisition led growth  it is important to understand the acquisition strategy 
Acquisition Strategy
The best business is that which generates high returns on invested capital and has avenues to deploy the incremental capital at similar higher rates  The avenues for capital deployment for growth can either be capital expenditures  CapEx  in existing business or acquisition  But statistics say that the base rates for acquisition led growth is quite average  However  since 2001  the Company has made over 40 acquisitions under Bessoul s leadership  Let s see what Bessoul himself has to say on the Company s acquisition strategy 
 Well  I can tell you the reasons that we don t make an acquisition   growth  or size  or buying a market  So all those three reasons  we will not go after an acquisition to buy a market  It s easy to get growth   I can discount my product and go after a market  I can go steal my competitor s engineers and get some type of a product emulation  We buy a company because we believe that they have two things that are important to us  One  they have the ability to be already a brand and a patented technology  that is already disruptive  That will take us many  many years to get to 
Number two  the ability to buy it and retain the management so that management allows us to basically  with some capital infused by us and some DNA from Middleby  whether it s taking them internationally is that in five years or less  would like to have the multiples of that acquisition translate into a price of five times multiple or less after the acquisition integration  We would like also to be accretive in no more than 18 months 
So let s repeat the three things  One  it has to have a brand with a disruptive technology or patent  Number two  we need to be able to get within five years or less to a five times multiple or less after we realize the synergies and the integration benefits  Number three  it has to be accretive in 18 months or less  
Most acquisitions that happen are done for growth  size or buying a market  While Bessoul s strategy for acquisitions makes sense  it is important to see how the numbers stack up against this stated strategy  The Company acquired only 2 companies until 2004 and began its acquisition spree from 2005 onwards 
It is no surprise that sales increased since 2001  as that is what acquisitions tend to do  What is interesting to observe is that the gross margins improved to 40  over this period  in fact  the gross margins have never gone below 38  since 2003  Even more impressive is the EBITDA margin improvement which has not gone below 18  since 2004  Also  the cash flows from operations  CFO  has increased considerably at a CAGR of 23  since 2001 and 19  since 2007  In fact  CFO increased every year since 2004 except for two minor dips    3  yoy  

The financial strength is evident in the D E ratio which is at a very manageable 0 6x  In fact  the Debt   Market cap is less than 0 2x which coupled with the interest coverage of 19x indicates the robustness of its financial position 
The return on capital employed  RoCE   which includes fixed assets  working capital and the entire goodwill on the books  a conservative approach as it does not include growth component of goodwill  has dipped below 16  only once since 2002  in 2015 when an acquisition was made that increased the asset base by 33    It quickly bounced back in 2016 
While the performance has been tremendously successful so far  an important question is whether this is sustainable  Does it have characteristics that would ensure that this will continue into the future  That is  does it have a moat 
Why Would A Competitor Find It Difficult To Compete 

Buffett talks about competitive advantage in terms of moats  those qualitative characteristics which help businesses defy the laws of capitalism  Moats come in many forms but the businesses we like best are those protected by multiple lines of defense  which are strong on their own and also reinforce each other  resulting in a truly strong model  Just as animals flourish in niches  similarly  people who specialize in the business world   and get very good because they specialize   frequently find good economics that they wouldn t get any other way  

  Charlie Munger
By deciding to focus on dominating a specific niche  cooking and warming  in the food service equipment industry  Middleby was able to generate considerable value for all stakeholders  In 1990s and early 2000s  the market served by Middleby was just around  2 billion  which meant that it was not so big that it attracted the attention of large companies  However  it was large enough for Middleby to grow  And then  slowly through acquisitions  it expanded the niche and its addressable market currently is now   13 billion  across 3 industries   It is currently the largest player in the industry by far and the only one which focuses on just this industry  while the competitors are part of conglomerates  How did it dominate the niche 
Branding  Brands matter as they inspire in the customers  the perception of quality  service levels  and other intangibles  For a brand owner  they have value only if they create pricing power or and if they result in repeat sales  In the case of Middleby  it has a whole host of brands in its stable  which have been in existence for decades  and in some cases for more than a century  The strength of the brands owned by Middleby is evident in the gross margins increasing from 30  in 1994 to 34  in 2001 to 40  currently  It has also resulted in repeat orders in Middleby s major segments   1 in pizza chains   1 in convenience stores   1 in fast casual   1 in Pan Asian cuisine   1 in casual dining   2 in QSR  Middleby s products are priced at a premium to its competitors  and not without reason 
Patents  technology  innovation  The company s acquisition strategy has brought a number of patents in addition to various industry leading brands  It has a strong set of patents  rather than one single patent which opens it to patent risk  across different product segments which allow it to offer features loved by its customers  In certain instances  it has used the technology available with itself coupled with that obtained through acquisitions to come out with newer features  which have then been patented  Additionally  it has spent  1  of revenues every year for more than 20 years on R D that helps it to continue to innovate and bring to the market  technologies that are in many cases beyond what the customer is looking for  For example  it came to the market with a touch technology equipment in 2006  way before a touch phone was introduced 
Scale  The brand power backed by the patent and technology capabilities result in a considerable scale of operations  This is further supported by the international business strategy  which was a focus right from the early 1990s  The distribution and the manufacturing scale implies significant advantages for the company  The advertising and research costs on an absolute basis might be high  but the scale results in a competitive fixed cost per unit 
Switching Costs  The fanatic focus on delighting the customer coupled with a strong service focus  brands and an innovation led culture have led to considerable switching costs for the customer  From a customer s point of view  the major factors in food service equipment are standardized products  can be used across regions   ease of use  quick cooking  energy   labor efficiency  low space usage  and service availability  Many of its products are developed after close discussions with the customer and include considerable customization  For chains which are fast expanding in the international markets  Middleby offers customized products and offers international servicing as well 
It is quite difficult for a competitor to match Middleby s value proposition  and the compelling offering ensures that it almost never loses a customer  One benefit to Middleby investors is its stability in revenues  With most of its chains focusing on aggressive global expansion  Middleby s capabilities imply it is an automatic choice for customers  driven by product quality  service availability and customization for international food preparation   This has been evident with the international revenues contribution to total revenues increasing from 28  in 2011 to 35  in 2016 
The Man Behind The Wheel 
Selim Bessoul is the intelligent fanatic credited with turning Middleby s fortunes around  He joined Middleby in 1996 as the president of the Southbend division  became the COO in 1999 and was made CEO in 2000 
Incentive alignment  The management and shareholder alignment of incentives is extremely important  To indicate his faith in the business  when he became the CEO  he mortgaged his home to purchase the Company stock  Also  he took a major part of his bonus pay in shares  He still holds a significant portion of his wealth in company shares  and his bonus is still linked to company performance and in stock options 
Unconventional approach  The atypical approach to solving issues were a major factor which drove the improvement in Middleby  Mentored and encouraged by Jim Sinegal of Costco  NASDAQ COST   he introduced the first  no quibble policy  in the food service equipment industry in the late 1990s  where any customer could return a product with a 100  refund in 90 days  no questions asked  The  no quibble  guarantee was very powerful  as the market share rose and pricing became a smaller factor in the buying decision  It also encouraged customers to tell the company how exactly they felt about the product  Another example of the unconventional approach is the one he took to resolve the employee attrition levels which was 40  when he joined the company  The bonus structure was made simpler and more observable  which was supported by workplace performance awards where any idea that led to productivity was given a  75 award  Here are his thoughts on organizational building  I promote the idea of having families working for me  It was the first unconventional thing I did when I joined  It s been such a success because those people are preachers for other people to join the organization and they now have the leverage to say   we have to succeed together   People like to work for me because I give them full empowerment  Everybody in your organization matters  And that s why I only allow three degrees of separation between me and the lowest ranked person in our organization  
Thoughts on cash  Salim Bessoul is from Lebanon and grew up in the period of civil war  His parents were asset rich but cash poor  Bassoul s parents had to sell a piece of land they were keeping for their retirement to fund him through college  The experience shaped much of his beliefs in life and the way he would run his business  Below are some of his thoughts on cash   It doesn t matter how rich you are  how financially solid you are  cash is king  You have to manage cash  We don t run our company through net income  we run it through cash  Coming from a culture in the Middle East where cash is everything  it meant something to me  There was no borrowing to be had during a civil war  It was all about cash  Conservative aggressive approach  We love managements who follow a conservative aggressive approach to managing a business  The conservative philosophy is evident in the thoughts on cash  the strong balance sheet and the willingness to shrink business  as was seen in the beginning of his tenure   The aggression and focus on growth are evident from the strong growth in sales  profits and cash flows through its acquisition strategy 
Giving back  Selim s personality and what he accomplished with Middleby came together in an instructive way recently when he inspired the company s engineers to develop a patented  highly affordable  multi functional oven in response to the needs of the 50 million refugees in the world  It has a magnifying glass that acts as a solar panel  so beyond cooking the appliance can purify water and charge a cell phone through heat transfer  not using electricity 
Cash Flow Analysis Implies Upside
Using multiple approaches for valuation is important  If all approaches point to undervaluation  then investors should be quite excited about the prospect of a stock  Using finbox io s 5 and 10 year DCF EBITDA exit models as well as the 5 and 10 year DCF growth exit models to arrive at a fair value indicate nice upside potential for Middleby  For the 5 year projections  we have used a 6 3  CAGR growth in revenues for the next five years and EBITDA margins are projected to reach 26  by the fifth year  For the 10 year projections  we have taken revenue CAGR of 6 3  for the first five years and 4 2  for the next five years  while the EBITDA margins are projected to remain flat at 26  by year 5 and thereafter  Overall  this forecast is conservative based on the company s  

The list below indicates the fair value based on each approach and the upside downside from the current price   120 55   Overall  the company appears to be nearly 15  undervalued when weighting each approach equally 
10 Year DCF Model  Gordon Growth Exit     2 3  
5 Year DCF Model  Gordon Growth Exit     7 7  
10 Year DCF Model  EBITDA Exit     20 6  
5 Year DCF Model  EBITDA Exit     23 8  
Risks To The Thesis 
Keyman risk  Selim Bessoul  the talismanic CEO has been a major influence on the company reaching its strong position that it enjoys currently  This seeming reliance is a risk for the Company 
Economic cycle  The company s business and financial performance  may be adversely affected by the current and future economic conditions  A decline in business and consumer spending  a reduction in the availability of credit by its existing customers could result in customers electing to delay the replacement of aging equipment 
Currency risk  While the increasing international exposure reduces geographic concentration risk and increases growth avenues  it does expose the company to currency related risks as the forex exposures are not fully hedged 
Conclusion  Buy   Hold
Middleby is a well run business enjoying strong competitive advantages  The company is run by an exceptional manager whose incentives are aligned with that of the minority shareholders  In addition  the valuation is attractive on a future cash flow basis calculating nearly 15  margin of safety  Value investors should consider this a good business to hold for the foreseeable future or at least until its economics change ",2017-07-12,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/middleby:-shedding-the-fat-and-growing-strong-200200720,200200720

line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Notably  the figure reflected growth of 2  year over year An improving macro environment  restructuring benefits and lower expenses boosted the bottom line Inside the HeadlinesNet sales remained flat year over year at  3 574 million  on both a net and underlying basis  Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 489 million  Underlying sales growth for the quarter was down 3  and currency translation also affected the top line adversely  Consistent improvement in key end markets and growth in the U S   Europe and Asia drove sales  However  challenging macroeconomic conditions and significant decline in spending by global customers in the oil   gas and industrial markets hurt the top line performance  resulting in flat growth The company s Automation Solutions platform reported a 3  year over year decline in net sales to  2 117 million  Underlying sales also dipped 3  as restrained spending in energy related and general industrial markets hurt operations  Underlying sales in North America declined 2   while Asia was also down 2   Europe was flat  while Latin America and Middle East Africa were down 16  and 9  respectively Despite soft spending by the oil and gas clients  MRO activity levels in energy related markets are gathering momentum  particularly in North America  driven by shale and downstream customers  Power and life sciences markets also remained favorable Margins contracted 10 basis points to 15 5   primarily due to deleverage on lower volume  In light of current and expected order trends  the company anticipates the second half of the fiscal year to gain momentum  driven by MRO and small project activity In contrast  the Commercial   Residential Solutions platform witnessed a 5  increase in net sales to  1 460 million  supported by robust demand in global HVAC and refrigeration markets  and encouraging conditions in construction related markets  Asia witnessed particularly strong growth as it rose 13  year over year  driven by 20  growth in China  which is enjoying major demand acceleration  Europe was up 6  led by solid growth in air conditioning and professional construction tools  while North America grew 4   stemmed by growth in the U S  residential and commercial air conditioning Latin America went up 7   while Middle East Africa was down 3  Under the platform  the Climate Technologies business grew 6 5  year over year to  1 058 million  while Tools   Home Products unit grew 2  year over year at  402 million Margins expanded 80 basis points to 23 7   largely due to savings from restructuring actions across the new platform structure and leverage on higher volume Emerson Electric Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Other DevelopmentsDuring the reported quarter  the company completed the acquisition of Pentair Valves   Controls  a business unit of Pentair plc  for  3 15 billion  in order to drive efficiency and growth Integrating Pentair s Valves   Controls business will enable Emerson to fortify its automation portfolio  and help it in offering complete valve solutions portfolio and sturdy service network  thereby elevating the company s brand value Last quarter  Emerson also expanded its global capabilities in fresh food monitoring  on the back of Locus Traxx and PakSense buyouts  These two companies will assist Emerson in facilitating steady and safe control of food and other temperature sensitive goods In third quarter fiscal 2016  Emerson had announced agreements to sell its Network Power  Leroy Somer and Control Techniques businesses  for an aggregate value of  5 2 billion  The deals are part of the company s portfolio repositioning strategy  as it seeks to enhance focus on its core Automation Solutions and Commercial   Residential Solutions businesses  The restructuring will help Emerson leverage on its growth platforms and drive profitable growth Emerson is now reporting the entire Network Power segment as discontinued operations Liquidity   Cash FlowExiting the quarter  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  5 billion  with long term debt of  3 8 billion  Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter plunged 66  from the prior year quarter to  410 million OutlookIn light of the recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets  Emerson raised its outlook for fiscal 2017 for the second time  It now expects net sales for the year to be approximately flat with underlying sales to be up about 1   excluding unfavorable currency translation of approximately 1    This is comparable to the prior projections of net sales for the year to be down 1 3   with underlying sales flat to down 2   Further  Emerson projects earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of  2 55  2 65  earlier guidance   2 47  2 62  Emerson now expects Automation Solutions net sales to be down 3 4   earlier projection  down 5 7    while Commercial   Residential Solutions net sales are now anticipated to be up 5 6   earlier projection  up 3 5   To ConcludeEmerson expects the challenging global market environment to recover gradually  as it sees improving economic conditions and positive trends in capital spending  Solid order trends  successful multi year restructuring initiatives  and momentum in both its platforms should drive results for the company in the coming quarters  Emerson s cost cutting and restructuring initiatives are likely to boost the company s profitability significantly  going forward However  a strong U S  dollar  low industrial spending  and weakness in emerging and mature economies remain major concerns Emerson currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the broader

earnings of  1 52  Based on the current market scenario  the company expects full year sales growth in between a 2  decline and a 2  increase from 2016 In terms of segments  Donaldson estimates both Engine Products and Industrial Products sales to be a range of a 2  decline to a 2  increase compared with the prior year While solid aftermarket sales are likely to act as tailwind  poor sales of heavy duty equipment  both off road and on road products  and commercial helicopters are anticipated to act as headwinds for Engine Products  For the Industrial Products segment  the company expects Industrial Filtration Solutions to act as growth catalyst  primarily driven by sales of replacement parts  However  the upside can be largely offset by sluggish Gas Turbine Systems and Special Applications businesses  sales ConclusionDonaldson s financials remain vulnerable to mixed recovery signals in broader markets  leading the company to give cautious guidance for fiscal 2017  On the positive side  factors including focus on operational efficiency  like implementation of the global ERP system   robust replacement part sales  winning new first fit programs and steady market expansion are expected to drive growth  Further  this quarter recorded stability in some of Donaldson s businesses Factors such as decline in heavy duty on road transportation business  sluggish global agriculture  mining equipment and construction markets are anticipated to play spoilsport  Moreover  waning U S  defense spending  softness in the commercial aerospace and major project deferrals are expected to worsen the company s prospects  Further  recent exchange rate volatility remains a concern for the company On the positive side  Donaldson expects good prospects in the

34629,256144,MIDD,A O  Smith  AOS  Keeps Earnings Beat String Alive In Q1  Grows Y Y,opinion,"A  O  Smith Corporation   NYSE AOS   reported first quarter 2017 earnings per share of 50 cents  The company comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents by 6 4   thus maintaining its earnings beat streak for the twenty second straight quarter 

The earnings figure also improved 22  from the year ago tally of 41 cents  The bottom line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth  Excellent top line growth proved conducive to the bottom line performance 
Inside the Headlines
Net sales in the quarter were up an impressive 16 2  year over year to  740 0 million  It also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  700 million  A thriving water heater industry in the U S  as well as robust consumer product demand in China fuelled the top line growth 
Talking about segments  A O  Smith s sales in the North America segment  comprising U S  and Canadian water heaters and boilers  grew 15  year over year to  487 3 million  Higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U S  and Canada proved conducive to the sales performance of the region  In addition  the previously completed acquisition of residential water treatment company  Aquasana  contributed  10 3 million to revenues  thus supplementing the segment s growth 
Segmental operating earnings rose 13 4  year over year to  104 2 million due to increased volumes of water heaters and higher prices  However  operating margin contracted 30 bps to 21 4  on a year over year basis  Lower operating margin of the acquired Aquasana business resulted in the decline 
Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment  China  India and Europe  rose 19 4  year over year to  259 5 million  The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A O  Smith s premium water heating and water treatment products  particularly in China  up 27   excluding impacts of the U S  dollar   While water treatment sales in China grew over 50   air purification sales rose over 80  year over year 
Operating earnings at the segment surged 32  year over year to  32 5 million in the quarter  Excellent sales in China more than offset multiple headwinds  including higher selling and advertising costs and currency headwinds  Operating margin advanced 10 bps to 12 5  year over year Smith  A O   Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Share Repurchases
During first quarter 2017  A O  Smith repurchased around 606 850 common shares for  30 1 million  At the end of the first quarter  the company has approximately 4 3 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase  
Liquidity   Cash Flow
Exiting the quarter on Mar 31  2017  A O  Smith s cash and cash equivalents were  293 4 million  compared with  330 4 million at the end of Dec 31  2016 
At the end of the quarter  long term debt was  362 2 million  compared with  316 4 million at the end of Dec 31  2016 
Guidance
Concurrent with its first quarter results  the company hiked its full year earnings guidance by 3 cents per share   A O  Smith now expects 2017 earnings to lie in the range of  2 03  2 09 per share  compared to the earlier guided range of  1 98  2 08  The upward guidance revision is primarily attributable to outstanding top and bottom line performances in the reported quarter  For full year 2017  the company expects revenues to grow in the range of 9 10   
Our Take
A O  Smith s consistent top and bottom line beats over the past several quarters highlight the company s underlying strength  We believe stellar growth prospects in China and the U S  end markets will continue to accelerate growth  going forward  Also  dominant foothold in the North American water heater market  along with thriving prospects in residential and commercial boiler markets are likely to boost growth 
This apart  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s solid financial health  strategic capital expenditures to fortify market position and overall positive trends bode well for long term growth 
Other Stocks to Consider
Some other stocks in the broader sector include Donaldson Company  Inc    NYSE DCI    EnerSys   NYSE ENS   and The Middleby Corp    NASDAQ MIDD    While Donaldson sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   EnerSys and Middleby carry a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
With three beats over the trailing four quarters  Donaldson has a positive average earnings surprise of 5 9  
EnerSys surpassed earnings estimates each time in the past four quarters  with an average positive beat of 4 4  
Middleby Corporation beat earnings in each of the trailing four quarters  resulting in an average surprise of 14 1

34764,256279,MIDD,How Middleby Corp   MIDD  Stock Stands Out In A Strong Industry,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Middleby Corporation   NASDAQ MIDD    This is because this security in the Machinery General Industrial space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Machinery General Industrial space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 46 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Middleby Corp   is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from  1 08 per share to  1 09 per share  while current year estimates have risen from  4 41 per share to  4 53 per share  This has helped MIDD to earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   further underscoring the company s solid position So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Middleby Corp  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment ,2016-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-middleby-corp.-(midd)-stock-stands-out-in-a-strong-industry-200133916,200133916
34780,256295,MIDD,Central Banks Take Center Stage As Stocks Seek A Catalyst,opinion,Volume remains low as the bulls continue to await Wall Street s return from late summer vacations   and a firm plan from the central banks   I think many portfolio managers must be spending their days in the stands at the U S  Open tennis tournament   The S P 500 closed out August with a third straight monthly gain  The major indexes continue to hold their psychologically important support levels of Dow 13 000  Nasdaq 3 000  S P 500 1400  and Russell 2000 800 Healthcare stocks continue to be strong  The iShares Dow Jones U S  Healthcare Sector Index Fund  IYH  hit another all time high on Wednesday  Also at an all time high is the iShares Dow Jones U S  Consumer Services Index Fund  IYC  As we wind down the 2Q2012 earnings reports  S P 500 companies appear to be averaging only 0 9  growth  Of the 10 major U S  sectors  Industrial showed the strongest second quarter growth rate of 13 4   Next strongest was Technology at 6 8   Holding back the averages were Materials at  16 2  and Energy at  12 0  both of which are still improvements from their third quarter performance The big news on Wednesday was ECB President Mario Draghi s bond buying proposal  It reportedly includes unlimited purchases of short dated  up to 3 year maturity  government debt that will be  sterilized  to dampen concerns about printing euros  To sterilize the bond purchases  the ECB removes elsewhere from the system the same amount of money that it spends  ensuring the program has a neutral impact on the money supply  With the ECB s deposit rate at zero and European banking system awash in excess liquidity  experts believe that an enhanced bond program should be workable  Draghi will announce whether his plan has been approved on Thursday Friday brings the much anticipated August jobs report  New claims for unemployment have been rising lately  so it s unlikely to show much improvement  Then  we ll see what the FOMC has to say at their next meeting on September 12 13 Another piece of news was the disconcerting report from the U S  Treasury that the total public outstanding debt has now passed the  16 trillion mark  which amounts to over  136 000 per household and over  50 000 per U S  citizen which is more government debt per person than Portugal  Italy  Spain  or Greece  We re spending about  200 billion per year on interest payments now The GOP and Democratic National Conventions have both served to solidify support among their key bases but apparently have yet to sway many minds in the middle  Both sides have been espousing platitudes about the American Dream and scare tactics about the future under the other party  Regarding the economy  Republicans promote a Libertarian view of unshackling businesses from undue regulation so they can thrive and become a job generation machine  while Dems push a populist view about the need for governmental oversight and guidance of business  a k a    cooperation   to protect the little guy from a  rigged system  and to ensure that there is longer term planning for education  jobs  healthcare  and a broad safety net  beyond the myopia of quarterly corporate earnings reports In the Republican view  government is the problem  In the Democratic view  government is the savior  Just look at the faces in the audience during the Democratic Convention  They idolize Bill Clinton and Barack Obama like rock stars protectors heroes to be worshipped  On the other hand  Republicans view their candidates as practitioners managers ship captains who have been hired to keep the country on the right course  In any case  we must await the debates to hear more substance about their respective programs  Then perhaps the independents and undecideds will be able to take a side Looking at the S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  chart  it closed Wednesday at 140 91  The 140 level has been serving as strong support for the past 4 weeks ever since breaking through this psychological resistance level on August 7  SPY has been trading within a bullish rising channel for over 3 months  and many market observers still say we are way overdue for at least a minor correction  SPY has been contending with strong technical resistance from the April May closing highs near 142  The bullish ascending triangle I thought might be forming last week seems to have failed  but price still remains within the established rising channel  but also within a shorter term sideways channel between 140 and 142  Price has fallen slightly below its 20 day simple moving average  but still sits bullishly above the 50   100  and 200 day SMAs  If markets try to correct  there are several interim support levels  including current support at 140  the rising 50 day SMA and the bottom of the larger rising channel just above 138  the 100 day SMA near 136  and then the 200 day SMA near 134  The oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are mostly neutral  but might be signaling they are ready to turn upwards   The VIX  CBOE Market Volatility Index a k a   fear gauge   has fallen back a bit from its recent rise  closing Wednesday at 17 74  Most of its oscillators have turned down from overbought  which is bullish for stocks   Here s one more bullish signal  FactSet reported that the 50 largest hedge funds increased their equity exposure by 3  during 2Q2012  and 45 of the 50 showed a net increase in equity assets   Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF   High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend   As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Observations 1  Outlook scores are little changed from last

continues to be hampered by a high forward P E and the worst projected long term growth rate 3  Overall  I would continue to categorize the rankings as neutral  with conservative sectors like Consumer Goods and Healthcare in the top 5  joining economically sensitive sectors like Technology and Financial 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 63  Utilities  IDU  is still by far the weakest on strong days  scoring 40  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  has been gradually losing its hold as the investor favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  It is now tied for the lead with a 55  along with Healthcare  IYH   Basic Materials  IYM  has been abandoned  relatively speaking  by investors during market weakness  as reflected by its low Bear score of 44  In other words  Materials stocks have tended to sell off the most when the market is pulling back  while Utilities and Healthcare stocks have held up the best 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  again shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 182  Telecom  IYZ  is the worst at 106  As for Bull Bear combination  Energy  IYE  is the best at 111  while Utilities  IDU  is by far the worst at 95  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each

 Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs These scores represent the view that the Technology and Consumer Goods sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Utilities sectors may be relatively overvalued based

34781,256296,MIDD,Sector Detector  Stocks May Stumble  But Will Not Fall,opinion,Despite an environment of uninspiring economic reports  stocks have regained their footing once again  Last week  bulls found that they simply couldn t ignore the Boston bombing like all the other worrisome news  but the quick capture of the perpetrators has removed the domestic terrorism cloud  Yes  we are in an environment in which stocks may stumble temporarily  but bears are having a devil of a time making them fall Perhaps the generally cautious direction of the equity inflows is playing a role in market stability  Although the general rule is that a healthy bull market is led by economically sensitive sectors  in this case it appears that investors are seeking the defensive sectors because they don t intend to pull money out any time soon  In many cases  they are investing for yield from equities because fixed income yield is so pathetic  That means dividend paying blue chips  value stocks  and steady eddy utilities and consumer staples This is not the standard definition of  risk on   Some would say it is the hallmark of a tenuous bull  But perhaps it is indicating that a true risk on phase of equity investment is still yet to come  That certainly would be bullish Looking at the chart of the S P500 SPDR Trust  SPY   it closed Wednesday at 157 88  Last week  it lost short term support at its 20 day simple moving average  but found reliable support at both the important 50 day SMA and the bottom line of the sideways channel at 153 5  It then moved steadily higher right through Wednesday of this week  It was a classic bounce at strong support  and now the sideways trading channel appears to have widened from 153 5 157 to 153 5 160  Of course  160 on the SPY corresponds with 1600 on the S P 500  which is psychological resistance  I also have drawn a potential rising channel that might be forming The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 13 61  Even on spikes  it has not come close to challenging the important 20 level Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Technology  IYW  moves back to the top ranking with an Outlook score of 78  followed by defensive sector Consumer Goods  IYK  at 72  Last week s top ranked sector Financial  IYF  falls all the way to fifth this week at 59  IYW continues to display a low forward P E  strong projected long term growth  and the best trailing return ratios  while IYK moved up on the basis of its favorable return ratios and strong support among Wall Street analysts  i e   net upgrades in forward earnings estimates   In fact  defensive sectors Telecom  IYZ   Utilities  IDU   and Consumer Goods  IYK  all show the most improvement in sell side support 2  Nevertheless  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 0  It is weak in forward P E  long term projected growth  and trailing return ratios  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Basic Materials  IYM   which continues to be pummeled by Wall Street earnings downgrades 3  This week s rankings maintain an overall neutral tone  with a very slight bullish bias given that Tech  Energy  and Financial are all in the top five 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Financial  IYF  is the leader on particularly strong market days  scoring 56  followed closely by Consumer Goods  IYK   Consumer Services  IYC   and Healthcare  IYH   Basic Materials  IYM  is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 47  But the top bottom spread is quite narrow at only 9 points  which continues to indicate high sector correlation on strongly bullish days 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is serving as the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 65  while Basic Materials  IYM  is the worst during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 44  The top bottom spread is 21 points  which continues to indicate lower correlations on weak market days    i e   it pays to be in the safe sectors when the market is bearish These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Consumer Goods sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Some top ranked stocks within Technology and

34782,256297,MIDD,Fed Tries To Refill Bulls  Fuel Tank As Cyclicals Lead,opinion,The market went through some gyrations on Wednesday in reaction to Fed Chairman Bernanke s testimony before the Joint Economic Committee  He first defended continued quant easing by warning   A premature tightening of monetary policy could lead interest rates to rise temporarily but also would carry a substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery   Stocks dutifully rallied and all major indexes hit new intraday highs But alas  consensus is apparently not a given over the longer term  The minutes hinted that a tapering off could start sooner   A number of participants expressed willingness to adjust the flow of purchases downward as early as the June meeting if the economic information received by that time showed evidence of sufficiently strong and sustained growth   So   the indexes turned tail and sold off by the close to give back the last few days  gains  Still  the Fed is clearly prepared to keep the liquidity flowing as long as necessary  which should be giving the market sufficient confidence to continue its uptrend Furthermore  with Japan aggressively devaluing the yen  the ECB is likely to take more aggressive action with the euro  As Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Partners has opined in his weekly commentary  it would serve the primary purpose of propping up the EU peripheral economies while avoiding criticism from the core economies of Germany and France by helping them to boost exports With this global currency war approaching full participation  the major economies of the world are seeking to devalue themselves into prosperity  So far  it seems like an effective plan  In fact  Goldman Sachs  GS  revised its year end target for the S P 500 from 1 575 to 1 750 while anticipating increasing dividends from the S P 500 That will require greater leadership from the cyclicals  and indeed sector rotation  or broadening  continues  Over the past month  the new sector leaders have been Technology  Energy  Materials  Financial  and Industrial  which gives further evidence of the broadening we are seeing from new capital entering the market We already knew that the outperformance of defensive sectors like Healthcare  Consumer Staples and Utilities  primarily due to investor comfort with their inelasticity of product demand and dividend yields  wouldn t be sufficient to power the markets forever  particularly as their valuations surged  No  a continuation of the rally will have to be led by economically sensitive sectors and investors who are betting on economic growth  Note that Hewlett Packard  HPQ  tried to do its part afterhours on Wednesday with a better than expected earnings report and improved forward guidance Many market observers have been concerned about the unrelenting persistence of the uptrend  noting that a healthy market has ups and downs  severe tests of bullish conviction  and momentum riding in both directions  They fear we are headed for a devastating market correction that could threaten the recovery by destroying the  wealth effect  on which it has been based  They believe the rally has been artificially manufactured by our central bankers  which inevitably makes it doomed to fail  In addition  equity correlations remain far too high However  keep in mind that the rally began on the heels of what many feared was global financial Armageddon followed by massive default of European debt and the collapse of the euro  Stock valuations are simply recovering to where they might have been anyway had it not been for the dire global crises and bunker mentality of investors  Plus  we enjoy the added fuel sources of yield hungry bond refugees  storehouses of cash in corporate coffers for buybacks and acquisitions  and lots of cheap freshly printed dollars in circulation  which isn t going to be removed by our friendly central bankers without plenty of advance warning and lots of solid economic data to maintain both business and investor confidence moving forward But once the easy money flow does start tapering off  the good news for investors is that the ultra high equity correlations should recede and stock picking will be back in vogue  Companies with solid business models and strong earnings quality should prosper while the coattail riders get exposed as the impostors they are Looking at the chart of the SPY  it closed Wednesday slightly below 166 and just about where it closed the prior Wednesday  After breaking out last week above the upper line of the bullish rising channel that has been in place since November  Wednesday s closing selloff left the SPY testing new support at the top of the rising channel  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all pointing down from severely overbought territory  and price seems to be on track for a reversion to the mean  Price is likely to pull back into the channel for some further technical consolidation before we see a concerted breakout The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 13 82  which remains quite low and supports bullish conviction Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  business sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up

this week  Stocks within IYK continue to enjoy the most support from insiders and Wall Street an analysts  i e   net upgrades in forward earnings estimates  and strong return ratios  However  those

However  the analysts haven t been quite as negative lately  and its Outlook score has improved from 28 to 33 3  This week s fundamentals based rankings appear to have improved slightly to a less defensive tone  as Consumer Services  IYC  has cracked the top five ahead of Utilities  IDU  4  Looking at the Bull scores  IYF has been the leader on particularly strong market days  scoring 55  followed closely by Industrial  IYJ  and Materials  IYM   while defensive sectors IYZ  IYH  and IDU have been the laggards on strong market days  scoring 48  This is  normal  market behavior and further evidence of the rotation into traditional leaders of market rallies  The narrow top bottom spread of 7 points continues to indicate high sector correlation on strongly bullish days 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is still serving as the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 62  followed closely by IYZ at 61  while Materials  IYM  is the worst during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 45  The top bottom spread is 17 points  which continues to indicate lower correlations on weak market days  i e   it pays to be in the  safer  sectors when the market is bearish 6  Overall  Consumer Goods  IYK  still shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 181  Telecom  IYM  is the worst at 113  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities  IDU  displays an impressive total score of 110 once again  followed closely by Telecom  IYZ   Materials  IYM  and Energy  IYE  display the lowest combined scores of 98 and 99  respectively  This indicates that Utilities stocks have performed the best overall during extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish
