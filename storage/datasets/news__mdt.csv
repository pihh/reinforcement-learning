173506,395022,MDT,FDA Approves World s Smallest Pacemaker from Medtronic,news,"Medtronic  NYSE MDT  announced on Tuesday that it had just received Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approval for its Micra AV pacemaker  Not only is this particular pacemaker the smallest in the world  but it s also one of the few lead less pacemakers available on the market  which are less invasive and have fewer complications than their lead containing counterparts  
Heart blocks are generally the result of heart disease and get progressively worse over time  The Micra AV pacemaker treats patients with atrioventricular  AV  block  a condition where the electrical signals in the heart are partially  or completely  blocked as they travel to the various chambers  This can often cause dangerously slow heart rates  requiring patients to wear pacemakers 


Leadless pacemakers are considered an alternative to their conventional counterparts  taking up less space while reducing the chance of infection or serious complications  Medtronic s Micra pacemakers are almost 20 times smaller than regular pacemakers    with a battery life that s almost twice as long 
Full launch coming this spring
Medtronic will begin offering training to physicians and medical personnel in the next few weeks  with a full launch coming later this spring  The company had originally submitted a request to the FDA to expand the use of its pacemaker to patients with AV block based on strong results from two separate clinical trials 
Analysts at RBC Capital markets went on to say in a note to clients that this new Micra AV pacemaker could have a much larger patient population to draw from thanks to this approval  They went on to add that in comparison to regular pacemakers  the Micra pacemaker gets three times the financial reimbursement from healthcare plan providers ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkz93,2064212

173560,395076,MDT,ECB Will Find Plenty of New Corporate Bonds If Purchases Resume,news," Bloomberg     The European Central Bank will have plenty of newer notes to consider if it returns to the corporate bond market as part of stimulus measures 
Companies have issued about 108 billion euros   121 billion  of ECB eligible bonds this year    outweighing some 55 billion euros of maturities    spurred by low borrowing costs and the return of U S  issuers  That has kept the overall ECB eligible universe at just over 1 trillion euros  based on data compiled by Bloomberg  Generally  the ECB only buys investment grade euro bonds issued by companies other than banks 
Still  the central bank already holds 177 7 billion euros of the eligible universe  a level little changed since the end of net asset purchase last year due to the reinvestment of maturing holdings  The bank also limits purchases to no more than 70  per note  Its buying ability may be further curbed by bondholders  reluctance to sell  given the shortage of alternative investments available amid  13 4 trillion of negative yielding bonds worldwide 
The ECB may buy 3 5 billion euros to 4 8 billion euros of corporate bonds each month  corresponding to 50  to 67  of net supply  if it resumes net purchases  according to a  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  SA estimate  Central bank President Mario Draghi sparked expectations for a possible resumption when he said in a speech last month in Sintra  Portugal that additional stimulus will be needed absent an improved outlook for growth and inflation 
This year  the bank has only bought into 29 of 161 new eligible notes  The notes it has bought into have an outstanding amount of 21 billion euros  just about 20  of the overall amount of eligible securities issued 
German and French borrowers issued most of the new eligible notes this year  with a combined 66 billion euros of sales  U S  borrowers sold 16 billion euros  The ECB can buy notes from non euro zone companies provided they are issued via a local entity  For instance  notes sold last month by Illinois based tractor maker Deere   Co  are eligible for purchase because they came from a Luxembourg unit 
About half of new ECB eligible bonds sold this year were issued by cyclical or non cyclical consumer names  Automakers and their suppliers led the cyclical sector  including bonds from Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG and Schaeffler AG  Non cyclical sales were boosted by reverse Yankee issuers such as Becton Dickinson   Co  and  Medtronic   NYSE MDT  Plc 
In terms of maturity  new eligible notes this year range to as long as 30 years  The ECB buys corporate bonds with maturities stretching from six months to 31 years",2019-07-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ecb-will-find-plenty-of-new-corporate-bonds-if-purchases-resume-1918129,1918129

173688,395204,MDT,ZBH Or MDT  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Products sector might want to consider either Zimmer Biomet  ZBH  or Medtronic  NYSE MDT   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Zimmer Biomet is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Medtronic has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that ZBH s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ZBH currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 97  while MDT has a forward P E of 21 54  We also note that ZBH has a PEG ratio of 2 67  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MDT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 93 
Another notable valuation metric for ZBH is its P B ratio of 2 62  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  MDT has a P B of 3 19 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ZBH s Value grade of B and MDT s Value grade of C 
ZBH is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ZBH is likely the superior value option right now ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zbh-or-mdt-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200505284,200505284

173705,395221,MDT,Medtronic  MDT  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Medtronic  NYSE MDT   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  119 84 in the previous session  Medtronic has gained 4 9  since the start of the year compared to the 2 8  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 3 3  return for the Zacks Medical   Products industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 19  2019  Medtronic reported EPS of  1 31 versus consensus estimate of  1 28 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 38  
For the current fiscal year  Medtronic is expected to post earnings of  5 6 per share on  31 53 billion in revenues  This represents a 7 28  change in EPS on a 3 17  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 03 per share on  33 06 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 65  and 4 86   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Medtronic may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Medtronic has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 16 4X versus its peer group s average of 20 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 89  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Medtronic currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Medtronic passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Medtronic shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2020-01-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/medtronic-mdt-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200499999,200499999

A wave of these tax driven transactions swept through corporate America from 2011 2014  They largely ended in 2015 after a regulatory crackdown by the administration of former President Barack Obama   Previous waves had occurred in 1996 2002 and 2007 2009 
The Congressional Budget Office  a nonpartisan fiscal analysis arm of the U S  Congress  said profitable companies in the most recent wave reduced their worldwide tax expenses by  45 million on average in the year after doing their inversions 
 CBO projects that the U S  corporate income tax base will be reduced because of further inversion activity and the expansion of strategies to move profits to lower tax jurisdictions   the CBO said in its study 
It said U S  corporate tax revenues would shrink by 2 5 percent by 2027  if tax minimization strategies were effectively unchanged from those used in 2016  
Recent inversions included medical technology group  Medtronic  Plc s move  N MDT  to Ireland  and drugmaker Mylan NV s move  O MYL  to the Netherlands  both completed in 2014 
Mylan s operational headquarters is still in Pennsylvania  while Medtronic s is still in Minnesota  but both companies no longer are treated as U S  based companies for tax purposes ",2017-09-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tax-inversion-deals-saved-us-companies-45-million-on-average-cbo-530241,530241

173778,395294,MDT,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Insulet  PODD  Stock Now,opinion,Insulet Corporation   NASDAQ PODD   has been progressing well with respect to its four pronged strategy and already seems on track to achieve revenues of  1 billion by 2021  The four key initiatives are expanding Omnipod s market access  executing on its innovation roadmap  building the U S  manufacturing facility and implementing its plan to sell directly in Europe  However  a tough competitive landscape and macroeconomic uncertainty are likely to offset the positives to some extent This  10 66 billion worth commercial developer of insulin treatment expects a skyrocketing earnings growth rate of 263 2  for next year  Also  the company has a trailing four quarter negative earnings surprise of 145 8   on average Let s delve deeper into the factors that substantiate the company s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Advancement of U S  Manufacturing Facility  Management seems to be particularly upbeat about the manufacturing unit in Acton  MA  The company is currently in process of installing its second U S  manufacturing line with production of saleable items expected by mid 2020  Insulet Corporation Price   Omnipod s Market Access Expansion on Course  Insulet attained several milestones pertaining to extending Omnipod s market reach  In this regard  the company has been consistently gaining traction from the full commercial launch of the Omnipod DASH system in the United States during early 2019  In the third quarter  it successfully expanded the Omnipod DASH s coverage for commercial  Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries  By the end of this period  the coverage was stretched to more than 50  of all Medicare beneficiaries Omnipod Horizon  a New Thrust Area  Insulet has been making progress with relation to its development roadmap of the Omnipod Horizon automated insulin delivery system  At the end of the third quarter  Insulet was in final stages of the Omnipod Horizon development and has likely  started pivotals in the fourth quarter  so that the technology is ready to be introduced to the market by the second half of 2020  Insulet constantly supports Tidepool s innovation efforts with a focus on getting an open source  iOS based loop app and algorithm approved by the FDA  The company is also collaborating to secure Omnipod s FDA nod as a component of the Tidepool Loop automated insulin delivery system However  there are a few factors deterring the company s growth prospects Economic Uncertainty Hampers Growth  Weaker global economic conditions may deflate demand for Insulet s products  stiffen competition  exert pressure on prices plus dent supply and lengthen sales cycle  Insulet is also susceptible to the risk of reduction in healthcare spending in the United States  Canada and Europe due to an economic slump  We are particularly cautious as growth could moderate further if the economic scenario worsens Tough Competitive Pressure   Insulet operates in a highly competitive environment  dominated by firms ranging from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start ups  The company s Omnipod System primarily competes with

173813,395329,MDT,Under Trump  Congress likely to pull plug on medical device tax,news,By Nick Carey and Susan Cornwell WARSAW  Indiana WASHINGTON  Reuters    When Donald Trump takes over as president on Jan  20  one of the first business tax breaks he delivers is likely to go to the U S  medical device industry and companies like Mark Throdahl s  The chief executive of OrthoPediatrics Corp  based in northern Indiana  said his company has been able to hire more workers since the temporary suspension effective last January of a federal tax on medical devices  The tax was imposed as part of outgoing President Barack Obama s signature 2010 healthcare law  Throdahl said he hopes the incoming Republican led Congress and president will permanently repeal the tax  Trump and U S  lawmakers are likely to do that  according to lawmakers  lobbyists and industry executives  in a step that also would help larger medical device makers such as  Medtronic  Inc  NYSE MDT   Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX   St  Jude Medical Inc and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Tax cuts are Republican gospel  and Trump s new Republican administration is widely expected to make them happen  The medical device tax may be one of the first on the chopping block  It was first imposed in January 2013 as a funding mechanism for the Affordable Care Act  dubbed Obamacare  a law that has brought medical coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans  But Republicans hate Obamacare and this particular tax has powerful enemies in both parties  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said repealing the Affordable Care Act  dubbed Obamacare  will be the first order of business in the Senate when it convenes in January  Whether cutting taxes  including the one on medical devices  will deliver more jobs remains to be seen  The Congressional Research Service  a nonpartisan arm of Congress  said in January 2015  when the medical device tax was fully in effect  that it was having only  fairly minor  impact on production of devices and employment in the industry  That may not matter much  as Republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly try to link tax cuts to job creation  perhaps sensing this connection will resonate with Trump  who made big promises in his campaign about restoring U S  industrial employment  The medical device industry  in its long running assault on the device tax  is seeking to frame the fight as a jobs issue  Immediately after Trump s Nov  8 election victory  industry lobbying group AdvaMed wrote to him and Vice President elect Mike Pence  Indiana s governor  asking for permanent repeal of the tax  In the letter  AdvaMed President Scott Whitaker wrote   The medical device tax has been a significant drag on medical innovation  and resulted in the loss or deferred creation of jobs  reduced research spending  and slowed capital expansion   Industry complaints like these led Congress last year to temporarily suspend the 2 3 percent excise tax on the sale of non retail medical devices  such as pacemakers  heart valves and artificial hips  It had been in effect for only three years   HEADCOUNT FREEZE  OrthoPediatrics  founded in 2006  develops and markets implantable orthopedic devices  such as metal plates that can be attached to bones  to treat deformities and traumatic injuries in children  It has 60 employees in its Warsaw  Indiana headquarters  and 94 sales representatives around the United States  When the tax was in full effect  Throdahl said  OrthoPediatrics  had almost a headcount freeze during 2015  because of the revenue that was siphoned away by the tax  Since the tax s temporary suspension  he said   We ve resumed an aggressive pace of hiring and investment   There are about 9 000 U S  based medical device manufacturers  The industry accounts for about 520 000 U S  jobs and has  150 billion in direct sales  AdvaMed spokesman Mark Brager said  Indiana is home to several device companies  So are Minnesota  California and Massachusetts  Lawmakers from these states helped push through the temporary suspension of the device tax  Repealing the tax would further improve the already favorable tax profile of Medtronic  one of the largest U S  medical device companies  Two years ago  Medtronic did an  inversion  deal  which is when a U S  company shifts its home base to another country  at least on paper  to cut its tax bills  Medtronic is now technically based in Ireland  though it is still managed in Minnesota  Asked whether Medtronic expects the tax to be repealed  company spokesman Fernando Vivanco said   It s much too early to speculate on future tax policy   Republicans said the industry has little reason to fear that the tax will ever return  Senator John Barrasso  a member of the Senate Republican leadership  said Obamacare repeal legislation will move next year in a way that will circumvent expected Democratic resistance   The plan is to move the entire piece that we moved last year   Barrasso said  referring to Republican backed repeal legislation that ultimately was vetoed by Obama   And it did include the medical device repeal  so I would expect that to be part of the list as well  It s to repeal the taxes related to Obamacare   Barrasso added  J C  Scott  head of government affairs at AdvaMed  said companies  feel a great sense of urgency in trying to get complete repeal done early next year  rather than later in the year  because companies need certainty   Repealing the tax would worsen the federal budget deficit   Any time you repeal a tax  that is a loss of revenue to the federal government   said Jack Hoadley  a research professor at Georgetown University s Health Policy Institute  But this tax was never a big one  relatively speaking  When imposed  it raised barely  2 5 billion a year  less than expected  By comparison  federal tax subsidies to help people obtain health insurance under Obamacare in 2016 were estimated to be  660 billion  the Congressional Budget Office said  Ever since the tax was put on hold  it has been viewed as endangered   At the time it was suspended  we were told by people in Washington that in all probability it will not be reinstituted  But still  we ll all sleep better at night knowing that it s gone   OrthoPediatrics CEO Throdahl said

173832,395348,MDT,Medtronic  MDT  Releases Positive Study Results On Pacemaker,opinion,Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT   recently announced favorable data from its study on MARVEL 2  Micra Atrial Tracking Using A Ventricular accELerometer   The study results demonstrate that an investigational set of algorithms in the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System   TPS   significantly improves synchrony and cardiac function in patients with impaired electrical conduction between the chambers of the heart  called atrioventricular  AV  block The company will present the results of MARVEL 2 on Nov 16 during a Featured Science session at American Heart Association 2019  the AHA Scientific Sessions Based on the favorable outcomes  Medtronic submitted a new leadless pacemaker  Micra AV  to the FDA for review  with an aim to expand the indicated population to AV block and normal sinus rhythm  With this  the company aims to strengthen foothold in the leadless pacemaker market on the back of the favorable outcome of the study  A Closer Look at the Micra PortfolioPer the company  the Micra TPS is the only leadless pacemaker approved for use by the FDA in the United States  The Micra TPS is much smaller in size compared to the traditional pacemakers  delivering the most advanced pacing technology to patients through a minimally invasive approach  The Micra is innovative as the TPS can be permanently switched off as per requirement Why is the Study a Breakthrough Per the company  the outcomes indicate that there will be an improvement in the coordination between the atrium and ventricle sections of the heart as a result of the upgraded to the Micra TPS  This improves outreach for patients  who are eligible to be treated with the leadless pacemaker The MARVEL 2 study assessed 75 patients worldwide with a Micra TPS  out of which 40 patients had complete heart block and normal sinus rhythm and were eligible for inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis  There were no abnormal occurrences in meeting the safety objective of the study   its primary endpoint Recent DevelopmentsOf late  Medtronic has been witnessing a slew of innovation related to its cardiac and vascular business The company launched the Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system in Japan for the minimally invasive repair of thoracic descending aortic aneurysms  TAA  and complicated type B

173833,395349,MDT,Medtronic  MDT  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Medtronic  NYSE MDT  reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 28 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 9  
Revenues are expected to be  7 68 billion  up 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 05  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Medtronic 
For Medtronic  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Medtronic will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Medtronic would post earnings of  1 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 26  delivering a surprise of  6 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

173838,395354,MDT,Two deaths spark recall of St  Jude heart devices,news,"By Jim Finkle and Ransdell Pierson  Reuters    St  Jude Medical Inc  N STJ  on Tuesday said it would recall some of its 400 000 implanted heart devices due to risk of premature battery depletion  a condition linked to two deaths in Europe  The devices shock dangerously racing heartbeats back to their normal rhythm or to treat heart failure  All the devices  called ICDs and CRT Ds  contain batteries that were manufactured before May 23  2015  when the company added insulation to reduce the chance of an electrical short circuit   There have been two deaths that have been associated with the loss of defibrillation therapy as a result of premature battery depletion   St  Jude s vice president of quality control  Jeff Fecho  said in an advisory to physicians on Tuesday  The devices were introduced in 2010 and are meant to last for seven years or longer  until their batteries are depleted  the company said  They are designed to vibrate at regular intervals once power is diminished  a signal to patients that they should visit their doctors for replacements within 90 days  In addition  a home monitoring unit wirelessly reads the battery level and other information and routinely sends details to doctors  The company said one of the patients died after his vibration signal indicated low power  but a few days before his planned replacement   The company said the recall is not expected to have a material financial impact on the company  although many patients are expected to visit their doctors and some could request early replacements  St  Jude said 841 devices had been returned to the company for analysis due to premature battery depletion  traced to a build up of lithium clusters in the batteries   Mark Carlson  medical officer of St  Jude  said in an interview the company s advisory board of physicians has strongly recommended that most patients not seek prophylactic replacements  because the risk associated with replacing the devices outweighs the low risk of a patient problem occurring   News of the issue surfaced late on Monday when short selling firm Muddy Waters tweeted a copy of a physician advisory from St  Jude  which agreed in April to sell itself for  25 billion to  Abbott Laboratories   N ABT   The letter said problems with the lithium batteries were rare and could be identified by patients using tools for monitoring battery levels at home  Patients should seek immediate medical attention as soon as they get a low battery alert from the monitoring devices  the U S  Food and Drug Administration said  in announcing the recall   Hospitals should immediately remove any unused devices affected by this recall  and contact the manufacturer to receive corrected devices   the FDA said  Wedbush Securities analyst Tao Levy said the recall would likely cost St  Jude no more than  a few million dollars  because relatively few patients will need early replacements and devices now being sold have improved and reliable batteries  St  Jude s shares fell 3 5 percent  while Abbott s declined 5 4 percent  Abbott said it still expects to close the St  Jude deal this year  The recall comes as St  Jude is defending itself against unrelated allegations that its heart devices are riddled with defects that make them vulnerable to cyber hacks  Those claims were made by Muddy Waters and research firm MedSec Holdings  St  Jude has denied the allegations and sued both firms  The FDA said on Tuesday its investigation into the cyber security vulnerabilities of the devices  including the Merlin Home monitoring system  was continuing   Despite the allegations  at this time  the FDA strongly recommends that the Merlin Home device be used to monitor the battery for these affected devices because the benefits of continued patient monitoring and the life saving therapy these devices provide greatly outweighs any potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities   the FDA said in a statement  Battery depletion recalls or advisories have been issued in the past two years by Boston Scientific Corp  N BSX  and  Medtronic  Plc  N MDT   with no visible impact on company businesses  according to  Barclays   LON BARC  analyst Matt Taylor  Medtronic in November recalled three models of its InSync III pacemakers due to battery problems  but overall company pacer sales continued to grow sharply thanks to newer products  Taylor said   Boston Scientific in September 2014 alerted doctors of potential battery life problems with two ICDs  and recommended that patients upgrade their software

173839,395355,MDT,Exclusive  EU regulators seen clearing  25 billion Abbott  St Jude deal  source,news,"By Foo Yun Chee
 Reuters    EU antitrust regulators are expected to give conditional clearance to U S  medical device maker  Abbott Laboratories    N ABT   25 billion bid for rival St  Jude Medical Inc  N STJ   a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday 
A spokesman for the European Commission  which is due to decide on the deal by Nov  23  declined to comment  Abbott  which also makes prescription drugs and diagnostics  had no immediate comment  St  Jude officials could not be reached for comment 
Abbott Chief Executive Miles White in October said he hoped to acquire St  Jude by the end of the year  despite lingering questions about the safety of its implantable heart devices 
The suburban Chicago company announced the St  Jude deal in April to expand its heart device business and help it compete against larger rivals  Medtronic  Plc  N MDT  and Boston Scientific Corp  N BSX  
The companies offered concessions to address the European Commission s concerns on Oct  31 but did not disclose details 
However  two weeks before that  they announced the sale of some of their medical devices worth about  1 12 billion to Japanese company Terumo Corp  T 4543   saying the move was part of their deal 
The all cash transaction included St  Jude Medical s Angio Seal and Femoseal vascular closure products and Abbott s Vado Steerable Sheath 
St  Jude is facing multiple problems  including an investigation by the U S  Food and Drug Administration over claims its heart devices have defects that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks 
The company sued short seller Muddy Waters and its investment partner  cyber research firm MedSec Holdings  after they claimed flaws in the cyber security of its devices  MedSec warned the alleged flaws could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates or have their batteries drained 
After Abbott reported stronger than expected earnings on Oct  19  White praised the way St  Jude has handled Muddy Waters  allegations 
In an unrelated matter last month  St  Jude said it will recall some of its 400 000 implanted heart devices due to the risk of premature battery depletion  a condition linked to two deaths in Europe 
Shares of Abbott and St  Jude both closed 1 6 percent higher on Tuesday amid moderate gains for the broad stock market

173841,395357,MDT,Hudson Executive Capital Co Founder Woolery resigns,news,"By Michael Flaherty
NEW YORK  Reuters    Veteran dealmaker James Woolery  co founder of Hudson Executive Capital  resigned from the firm less than a year after it made its first investment  the activist fund said on Monday 
Woolery  who previously worked at JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  and law firm Cravath  Swaine   Moore  resigned for personal reasons  effective immediately  Hudson Executive said in a statement 
The statement came after Reuters broke the news of Woolery s departure 
Hudson Executive Capital thanked Woolery for his role in the firm s launch and said it was  well positioned to continue to execute on our investment strategy  
Woolery co founded the firm with another veteran JPMorgan dealmaker  Doug Braunstein  The two solidified their plans for the firm over hamburgers at Braunstein s Hudson Valley home  and officially launched in January 2015  A year later  the firm disclosed its first investment  a 5 percent stake in HeartWare International  a heart valve maker 
Six months later  HeartWare agreed to be bought by  Medtronic  Inc  NYSE MDT   for  1 1 billion  an announcement that doubled HeartWare s stock price on the day  It was one of several companies in Hudson Executive s portfolio that struck a deal after the firm s investment  
Woolery s departure happened on friendly terms  with Braunstein buying out his partner s ownership interest in the firm  according to people familiar with the matter 
Hudson Executive Capital s launch created a lot of buzz on Wall Street and across the activist hedge fund sphere  given both Braunstein and Woolery s high profile M A reputation and their  constructivist  model 
Unlike a traditional activist hedge fund that loudly agitates for changes to a company under the threat of replacing board members  Hudson Executive set out to work collaboratively with management teams  without the threat of a proxy fight 
The firm enlisted 14 current and former chief executives as co founders and co investors in the fund when it launched  raising  250 million

173895,395411,MDT,Burger King  Tim Horton s May Merge,news,"By   

Burger King Worldwide Inc  NYSE BKW and Tim Hortons Inc  NYSE THI reportedly are working on a deal to create a holding company  merging the hamburger giant and the coffee and doughnut chain into the world s third largest quick service restaurant provider  The deal would also move Burger King s base of operations from Miami to Canada in a so called tax inversion    a strategy that has been sparking outrage because it threatens U S  tax revenues

173896,395412,MDT,Treasury s Lew urges action on corporate  inversion  tax deals,news,"By Kevin Drawbaugh WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday called for swift action to close a federal tax code  loophole  that allows businesses to reincorporate abroad to avoid U S  corporate taxes  but offered no new ideas for how to do that 
Amid growing concern among Washington policy makers about these transactions known as inversions  Lew said the Treasury Department  is completing an evaluation of what we can do to make these deals less economically appealing  and we plan to make a decision in the very near future  
Though still rare and difficult to do  inversions have become more frequent among U S  multinationals in recent years  with notable companies such as medical technology group Medtronic Inc  N MDT  pursuing them 
The U S  government has grappled for more than 30 years with inversions  Fifty two substantial deals like this have occurred since 1983  about half of them since the 2008 2009 credit crisis  according to a Reuters analysis 
Laying out his views on Monday in a speech at a Washington think tank  Lew reiterated proposals already made by Democratic President Barack Obama that would make the deals more difficult to do  He also emphasized that the best way to address them is through broad business tax reform 
 Any action we take will have a strong legal and policy basis  but will not be a substitute for meaningful legislation     Only a change in the law can shut the door  and only tax reform can solve the problems in our tax code that leads to inversions   he said 
The likelihood of a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code this year is very remote  with congressional elections coming in November and lawmakers deeply divided over fiscal issues  according to policy analysts 
Lew acknowledged this  but referring to inversions  said  there is one loophole that should be shut down immediately  
He said   Right now  our tax system rewards U S  corporations when they buy foreign companies and then declare that they are based overseas     By effectively renouncing their citizenship but remaining here  these companies are eroding America s corporate tax base  
Obama has been asking Congress for the past four years to act on fresh proposals from the White House to curb inversion deals  The president has proposed making inversions harder to do by lowering the level of continued U S  ownership permitted for a company to be treated as a foreign corporation 
He has also urged a  substantial business activities  test that would deny foreign company status where operations are still primarily located in the United States and U S  managed 
In past proposals  he has also called for extending inversion limits to partnerships  as well as fighting U S  earnings stripping by tightening the limits on deductibility of interest paid by inverted U S  companies on inter company debt  a practice often associated with inverted companies

173897,395413,MDT,U S  Treasury moves against tax avoidance  inversion  deals,news,By Kevin Drawbaugh and Jason Lange  WASHINGTON  Reuters    Moving against tax avoidance by corporations  the Obama administration took several actions on Monday to curb  inversion  deals that allow companies to escape high U S  taxes by reincorporating abroad   The Treasury Department announced new rules  effective immediately  that will reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted  while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding   Because they took effect on Monday  the new rules might raise issues for some of a handful of companies that have agreed to do inversions  but have not yet completed them   Fast food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc  N BKW  is in the midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with coffee and donuts vendor Tim Hortons Inc  TO THI   A spokeswoman for Burger King said the company declined to comment   Asked about the impact on pending deals  a senior Treasury official told reporters on a conference call   If they are closed and done as of today  then they are not subject to this  If they are closed tomorrow or after  they are subject to this    President Barack Obama  who has sharply criticized inverting companies  said the Treasury Department s steps would  discourage companies from taking advantage of corporate inversions   moving their tax residence overseas on paper to avoid paying their fair share in taxes here at home    The announcement of the rules followed months of growing concern on Capitol Hill  with Democrats urging prompt legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the problem later  perhaps in 2015  as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole riddled federal tax code   Companies that do inversions  which are legal and already subject to certain restrictions  say they are only trying to minimize their tax bills  which investors expect   About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s  but half of those have been completed just since the 2008 2009 credit crisis  according to a Reuters review   MEDTRONIC DEAL PENDING  Inversions have surged in the past year  pursued by big companies such as Burger King and medical technology group Medtronic Inc  N MDT   which is working to close an inversion deal into Ireland with rival Covidien Plc  N COV    Medtronic spokesman Fernando Vivanco late on Monday told Reuters   We are studying Treasury s actions  We will release our perspective on any potential impact on our pending acquisition of Covidien following our complete review    Medtronic has said it expects to close the Covidien acquisition by the end of this year or early 2015   Inversions usually involve a U S  corporation buying a smaller  foreign rival and redomiciling in its home country  where taxes are lower  even though core operations typically remain in the United States    Graphic on corporate inversions     Treasury Secretary Lew said in a statement   These first  targeted steps make substantial progress in constraining the creative techniques used to avoid U S  taxes  both in terms of meaningfully reducing the economic benefits of inversions after the fact  and when possible  stopping them altogether    A key target of Treasury s actions is foreign profits held offshore by U S  multinationals under a U S  Internal Revenue Service  IRS  rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the United States   One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from using  hopscotch  loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax deferred foreign profits  Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using  decontrolling  strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U S  controlled   Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U S  owners can have in an inverted company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS  a move that will make it harder to do these deals   Some companies had feared that new rules might be imposed retroactively  but they were not   Greg Valliere  chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group  said the administration  may succeed in chilling the climate for further deals  but this was not as strident as it could have been  especially in that they don t do anything retroactively    SIDE STEPPING CONGRESS  The rules were the administration s latest effort to tackle what it sees as a pressing issue by taking executive actions that side step a gridlocked Congress    When corporations choose to invert and don t pay their fair share of taxes  they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab   said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin in a statement    Today  the Obama administration put these corporate tax deserters on notice  we are not going to stand by while they game the tax code and avoid their responsibility to our country   Durbin said   Though in disagreement about the issue s urgency  both Democrats and Republicans have said inversions are a symptom of a broken tax code that needs a thorough overhaul  a job that has eluded Congress and successive presidents since 1986   Senator Orrin Hatch  the top Republican on the tax law writing Senate Finance Committee  said in a statement   In the end  any solution that permanently addresses inversions must be legislated by Congress      Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson in Washington  Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles  Susan Leach in

173899,395415,MDT,Shares of  inversion  candidates slide on U S  tax rule,news,"By Ben Hirschler and Dan Burns LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Treasury s move to curb deals that allow U S  companies to escape high taxes at home wiped a combined  12 3 billion off the shares of nearly a dozen companies on both sides of the Atlantic on Tuesday  as investors reacted to the surprisingly far reaching action 
But it was unclear whether the tougher stance adopted by the Obama administration on  inversion  deals that allow companies to escape high U S  taxes by reincorporating abroad  which followed a wave of public criticism  would end any of the handful of deals currently in the works 
Burger King  which is in the process of an inversion deal with Canada s Tim Horton s  TO THI   said Tuesday it would proceed with its  11 5 billion deal despite the Treasury actions  saying the transaction was not about the tax benefits 
Nonetheless  the shares of some companies involved in or interested in merger deals were dealt strong blows  In London  AstraZeneca  L AZN  slid 3 6 percent  while Shire  L SHP  fell 2 5 percent 
The U S  Treasury move was seen as adding some risk around the deal for AbbVie  N ABBV  to buy Shire for  55 billion and might deter Pfizer  N PFE  from making another attempt to acquire AstraZeneca  after a  118 billion takeover attempt failed in May 
AbbVie slid 1 7 percent in midday U S  trading  while Pfizer  the biggest U S  pharmaceutical company  dipped about 0 3 percent 
More than a half dozen other companies in the United States and Europe saw their shares fall on the Treasury action 
Tim Horton was the only stock in the group to gain on the day  with its shares were up 0 2 percent in Toronto  though shares of Burger King Worldwide  N BKW  were down 1 5 percent in New York 
In announcing the intention for Burger King to proceed with its deal for Tim Horton  the two companies said in a statement   This deal has always been driven by long term growth and not by tax benefits  
Investors had been expecting some action from the Obama administration to clamp down on tax avoidance inversions but the steps announced on Monday were more far reaching than anticipated  analysts at Deutsche Bank said 
The new rules  effective immediately  will make new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding   but whether that will be enough to scupper deals that are pending or under consideration is not clear 
The action follows months of political debate  with Democrats urging prompt legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the problem later  perhaps in 2015  as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole riddled federal tax code 
 Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off   Navid Malik  head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities  said 
That could kill off prospects of Pfizer returning to bid for AstraZeneca at the end of November  when a six month cooling off period imposed by British takeover rules comes to an end and the U S  group can publicly launch a new offer  Malik said 
Other analysts were less certain  Andrew Baum of Citi said the Treasury move would have a limited impact on the economic case for a Pfizer AstraZeneca deal   though the threat of additional measures could give the U S  group pause   and he still expects Pfizer to return after the Nov  26 deadline 
Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are bound by rules that mean they cannot comment on deal prospects  However  the British firm said previously that the controversial tax issue was a big risk for investors that could cause major delays to any transaction 
The Shire deal may still go ahead  since it is already in train  although AbbVie will likely lose upside from planned tax savings  making the picture uncertain  The transaction is due to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 
 Shire has enough momentum in its business and a good enough pipeline that it would be attractive to AbbVie anyway   Malik said   The tax inversion was the icing on the cake  
Shire and AbbVie officials did not have any immediate comment on the latest developments 
INVERSION SURGE
Other U S  listed issues under pressure from the Treasury actions included Abbott Laboratories  N ABT   down 1 5 percent  Covidien  N COV   down 2 8 percent  Medtronic  N MDT   down 3 5 percent  and Mylan  O MYL   down 0 3 percent 
In Europe  UK based Smith   Nephew  L SN  and Swiss biotech group Actelion  VX ATLN   two other perennial targets of bid speculation  fell 2 8 percent and 2 6 percent  respectively 
Inversions have surged in the past year  pursued by healthcare companies in particular  although the Burger King Tim Horton s deal shows the appeal extends into other sectors 
Medical technology group Medtronic  meanwhile  is working to close an inversion deal into Ireland with rival Covidien  while Mylan plans to buy certain Abbott s drugs in developed markets outside the United States in another tax cutting transaction 
About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s  but the pace has picked up  with half of those completed since the 2008 2009 credit crisis  according to a Reuters review 
A key target of Treasury s actions is foreign profits held offshore by U S  multinationals under a U S  Internal Revenue Service  IRS  rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the United States 
One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from using  hopscotch  loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax deferred foreign profits  Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using  decontrolling  strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U S  controlled 

Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U S  owners can have in an inverted company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS  a move that will make it harder to do these deals

173920,395436,MDT,Medtronic To Buy Covidien For  42 9B,news,"By    U S  medical device maker Medtronic Inc  NYSE MDT  said on Sunday it had agreed to buy Covidien plc  NYSE COV  for  42 9 billion in cash and stock and move its executive base to Ireland in the latest transaction aiming for lower corporate tax rates abroad 
While the deal will allow Medtronic to reduce its overall global tax burden  the Minneapolis based company said it was driven by a complementary strategy with Covidien on medical technology rather than tax considerations
 The real purpose of this  in the end  is strategic  both in the intermediate term and the long term   Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said in an interview after the deal was announced   It is good for the U S  in that we will make more investment in U S  technologies  which previously we could not  
Medtronic s corporate tax rate  now at around 18 percent  won t change much  Ishrak said 
The merger of Medtronic  the world s largest stand alone medical device maker  and Covidien  a maker of devices used in a range of surgical procedures  will create a close competitor in size to the medical device business of industry leader Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  
It broadens Medtronic s scope beyond its array of heart devices  spinal implants  insulin pumps and other products into areas such as weight loss surgery and laparoscopic procedures  The expansion should allow it to better compete for business from hospitals  particularly in the United States where healthcare reform efforts and shrinking government reimbursement for medical procedures has kept pressure on device pricing 
The disparate businesses means there should not be significant antitrust concerns  industry analysts said 
 Beyond the financial rationale  the company expands dramatically  and it puts them in a whole bunch of areas they never were in before  It makes sense   said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy 
Denhoy estimated the deal would shave 2 to 3 percentage points off the company s corporate tax rate  pointing to Covidien s rate of 16 percent 
The deal values each Covidien share at  93 22  paid for by  35 19 in cash and 0 956 Medtronic shares  The transaction represents a 29 percent premium to Covidien s closing stock price on Friday  Medtronic said 

The combination  which will leave Covidien shareholders owning about 30 percent of the combined company  is expected to result in at least  850 million of annual pre tax cost synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018  Medtronic said it would keep its operational headquarters in Minneapolis and pledged  10 billion in U S  technology investments over the next 10 years 
INVERSION APPEAL
Acquisitions of companies aimed at lowering corporate tax rates  known as inversions  have historically been rare but are becoming more common 
Some U S  lawmakers are concerned that the deals erode government revenue by giving corporations another tax avoiding loophole  Two bills in the U S  Congress and a White House proposal would make inversions harder to do  but neither has gained much traction  That could change if another major U S  company or two tried to conduct inversions  tax lawyers and analysts said last week 
Two recently attempted inversions failed  but only after they refocused political attention on the strategy  U S  based Pfizer Inc s bid for rival British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc was rejected  while the proposed combination of U S  advertising firm Omnicom Group Inc with France s Publicis Groupe SA collapsed for non tax related reasons 
Democrats in Congress have called for new restrictions on these deals  with bills offered by Senator Carl Levin and his brother  Representative Sander Levin  both Michigan Democrats  President Barack Obama has a proposal similar to the Levins   Republicans have expressed concern about inversions  but have not put forward legislation of their own 
Some lawmakers have said that anti inversion curbs should be tackled as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the loophole riddled U S  tax code  but this is a difficult project that Congress has not tackled since 1986 
Medtronic s deal with Covidien is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 or early 2015  Medtronic said

173946,395462,MDT,INTERVIEW Insulet to turn profitable within two years   CFO,news,"  Sees turning profitable by end 2010  beginning 2011
   Says comfortable with cash position
   Backs 2009 growth forecast
   Sees distribution deals in Europe  Asia next few months
 By Jennifer Robin Raj
 BANGALORE  June 18  Reuters    Even as reduced consumer
discretionary spending eats into its business and competition
looms large  insulin pump maker  Insulet Corp  expects to turn
profitable within two years  its chief financial officer said 
 The company is also looking to expand both into overseas
markets and the usage of its wireless pump to other therapies
beyond insulin delivery 
  We took into consideration as we planned into 2009 and
into 2011 and 2012  what the economy may do to our business   
We still feel pretty good about being able to get to
profitability by the end of next year  or the very beginning of
2011   CFO Brian Roberts told Reuters in an interview 
 This is despite a slowdown in growth and an increase in
patient attrition for its insulin pump  OmniPod  as
unemployment levels rise 
   OmniPod  is still a step up in monthly costs for a
patient as compared to a box of syringes   Roberts said  but
the company continues to see growth of 65 percent to 70 percent
growth in fiscal 2009 
 The company will also soon see direct competition for its
wireless insulin pumps from Medtronic Inc  the market leader in
traditional pumps  which is set to release its version in 2010 
  The traditional insulin pumps are still only 25 30 percent
penetrated in the U S  So there is plenty of room for more than
one player in the space   Roberts said 
   Medtronic  are a great marketing machine  They know how
to market to their base  That will make it a little bit tougher
for us but we certainly think we can compete  We think we will
have a better product   Roberts said 
 Insulet is counting on design simplicity and the addition
of a continuous glucose monitoring feature in a next generation
device  also set to be launched in 2010  to keep OmniPod
competitive 
 Insulin pumps are primarily used by patients with Type 1
diabetes and traditional insulin pumps have several feet of
tubing that patients typically conceal under clothing  while
OmniPod adheres to the skin and delivers insulin via a tiny
tube 
 Insulet is also comfortable with its cash position and is
not looking at raising cash in the near term  Roberts said 
 As of March 31  the maker of disposable insulin pumps had
 68 2 million in cash and cash equivalents and  32 5 million
available through a credit facility with Deerfield Management 
  We have access to about  100 million between those two 
which puts us in a pretty good position   Roberts said 
 ADDITIONAL STREAMS
 The company is in discussions with  partners of various
sizes  and expects to sign deals to distribute OmniPod in
Europe and Asia over the next few months 
 OmniPod received approval in Europe at the end of April and
Insulet expects to launch the product there by the end of this
year 
 The Swiss drug maker Ferring Pharmaceuticals is also
developing the OmniPod system for the delivery of its fertility
drug and is expected to file for marketing approval for that
indication in Europe next quarter 
 If approved  the product should start contributing revenue
by end of year  beginning of 2010  Roberts said  adding that
 it is a relatively small product but it is a great
proof of concept for us to show that OmniPod could be used
outside of insulin delivery as well  
 Insulet also announced in March that it signed an agreement
with a major pharmaceutical company for a healthy patient study
for an approved drug 
  The drug in question is given via injection and has
several side effects  The study will hopefully show that the
side effects can be lessened if the drug is given to a patient
using the OmniPod system over an extended period of time  
Roberts said while declining to give additional details

173947,395463,MDT,UPDATE 1 U S  court backs Synthes in U S  patent case,news,"  Court rules against Medtronic in ProDisc L patent case
   Court awards Synthes  21 million
 
  Adds details 
 ZURICH  Sept 7  Reuters    Switzerland based medical device
maker Synthes Inc has won a key ruling in an ongoing U S  patent
case against U S  competitor Medtronic  the Swiss company said
on Monday 
 The case  which began in 2007  concerned a patent covering
Synthes  ProDisc L artificial disc replacement device 
 The U S  District Court in Memphis acknowledged Medtronic
had infringed the patent  and awarded the Swiss maker of nails 
screws and plates to fix broken bones  21 million in damages 
interest and costs  Synthes said in a statement 
  We are pleased that the court has upheld the jury s
verdict   said Michel Orsinger  president and chief executive of
Synthes  
  Synthes has made substantial investments towards the
ProDisc artificial disc replacement devices  and the rulings by
the Court confirm our intellectual property rights in that
technology   he added 
 Synthes is the global market leader in trauma treatment and
ProDisc is seen by many analysts as a future growth driver 
 Synthes had filed suit against Medtronic in 2007 as it
believed the U S  group s Maverick products infringed its
artificial disc patent 
 A jury ruled in November 2008 that Medtronic had violated
Synthes  patent and a U S  court denied on Aug  19 Medtronic s
motion for a new trial 
 Medtronic is appealing these rulings to the U S  Court of
appeals  Synthes said in the statement

173967,395483,MDT,Medtronic  MDT  Surpasses Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Medtronic  NYSE MDT  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 26 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 18 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 17 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 78   A quarter ago  it was expected that this medical device company would post earnings of  1 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 54  delivering a surprise of 5 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Medtronic  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  posted revenues of  7 49 billion for the quarter ended July 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 11   This compares to year ago revenues of  7 38 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Medtronic shares have added about 14 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 6  
What s Next for Medtronic 
While Medtronic has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Medtronic was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 29 on  7 66 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 47 on  31 43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

results The therapy innovation space has been seeing multiple developments  Under Cardiac and Vascular Group   CVG    new therapies are helping the company gain traction from the rapidly growing MedTech market for left ventricular assist device  transcatheter aortic valve replacement  drug coated balloons  atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise   There has been a consistent and gradually stabilizing trend in the global cardiac rhythm and heart failure   CRHF   market  In the fiscal first quarter  the company is expected to register

meaningful markets Strong demand for the company s Micra transcatheter pacing system  Arctic Front AF ablation catheters  Reveal LINQ product lines and a robust performance in TAVR franchise are steadilydriving Medtronic s revenues within this niche However  in the to be reported quarter  this growth can be offset by weakenedsales of left ventricular assist device  LVAD  as a result of market share loss  due to the regulatory approval of Abbott s competitive product HeartMate 3  and certain unfavorable changes in the heart transplant guideline  This apart  sales may decline as the company is in its CRM replacement cycle Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at  2 76 billion  indicating a 1 8  dip from the year ago reported number Within Restorative Therapies Group   RTG    the company is again projected to register a solid progress  particularly in Brain   Pain divisions despite challenges in the Spine market Medtronic s integrated robotics and navigation platform Mazor X Stealth is expected to drive growth in Neurosurgery business along with creating demand for the core spine implants The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTG revenues in the fiscal first quarter stands at  1 98 billion  implying a 10 8  decline from the last reported figure Within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group   MITG    the company is once again expected to deliver higher revenues  banking on sturdy sales of Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy products  However  the company s Surgical Innovations businessmay persistently suffer challenges due tothe shutdown of a major sterilization supplier s facility The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MITG revenues in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at  2 07 billion  suggesting an 8 1  drop from the last reported quarter Within Diabetes  Medtronic will likely to sustain U S  patient demand for its MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system in the June quarter  Outside the United States  the company is witnessing buoyant demand for 640G system  It is continuing with the launch of MiniMed 670G in some European countries  which in turn  should consistently boost its international diabetes revenues The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes revenues is pinned on  589 million  indicating an increase of 2 9  from the prior year reported figure Here s What the Quantitative Model PredictsThe proven

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Chevron  CVX   IBM  IBM  and Medtronic  NYSE MDT   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Chevron s shares have gained  9 7  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry s  3 4  increase as its financial results have greatly improved over the period  In fact  Chevron s free cash flow and upstream production for 2018 hit a record  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting a CAGR of 3 4  through 2023 thanks to the planned expansion in the Permian Basin  Moreover  growing free cash flow should enable Chevron to deliver stable and rising dividend in the foreseeable future  
However  there are worries of a drop in its downstream earnings that have been cutting into overall gains from rising E P income  The massive capex might also play a spoilsport  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point before buying shares in Chevron

Shares of IBM have outperformed the broader market on a year to date basis  increasing  24 2  vs  the S P 500 s  13 1  gain  IBM provides advanced information technology solutions  including computer systems  software  storage systems and microelectronics  
The Zacks analyst thinks IBM s improving position in hosted cloud  security and analytics bodes well for investors  The RedHat acquisition  aimed at enhancing its hybrid cloud platform  is likely to pave the way for IBM s growth prospects  However  softness in Systems revenues and technology   cloud platforms remain a concern  
Stiff competition does not bode well for the Storage hardware segment  Strategic imperatives will take some more time to report meaningful growth and offset weakness in the traditional business  IBM s ongoing heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud is a headwind  Additionally  ballooning debt levels have been troubling IBM over time 
 You can   
Medtronic s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry in the past year  gaining  17 5  vs   15 5   The Zacks analyst thinks Medtronic is successfully registering sustainable growth across major groups and regions  in addition to displaying successful achievement of synergy targets  
The company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses  This apart  the company has been seeing certain favorable developments in its Diabetes business  The updated 2019 guidance with raised EPS view increases investors  confidence on the stock  
Meanwhile  the recently closed acquisition of Mazor Robotics  which is expected to fortify Medtronic s position in spine surgery  is a major positive  Yet  the declining CRHF segment raises concerns  Escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on Medtronic s bottom line

174117,395633,MDT,Bull Of The Day  Tandem Diabetes Care  TNDM ,opinion,Tandem Diabetes Care  TNDM  is a  2 7 billion medical device company that designs  develops  and commercializes products for people with insulin dependent diabetes  The San Diego based company is expected to have grown 2018 sales by over 60  to  164 million  while this year s forecast is for 37  growth to  225 million  Tandem products include the t slim Insulin Delivery System  which just got a big technology upgrade and an FDA approval last week  On Valentines Day  Tandem announced that the FDA classified the t slim X2 insulin pump as the first in a new device category called Alternate Controller Enabled Infusion Pumps  or ACE pumps  The approved indication for the t slim X2 pump states that the pump is able to reliably and securely communicate with compatible  digitally connected devices  including automated insulin dosing software  to receive  execute  and confirm commands from these devices  This new type of insulin pump is described as having  interoperable  technology for delivering insulin under the skin for children and adults with diabetes  meaning it can be used with different components that make up diabetes therapy systems  allowing patients to tailor their diabetes management to their individual device preferences  Profits on the Horizon  After Shares Fall from  300 to  3 TNDM shares were already in the upper realms of the Zacks Rank before the expected announcement because the current sales ramp had analysts raising their earnings estimates with the 2019 consensus rising over 75  to a loss of just 77 cents  This follows full year 2018 EPS expected to come in near a loss of  3 22  Tandem reports for Q4 on 2 26   which would also be 75  growth from 2017 s loss of  12 87  This acceleration in net income is a welcome event for TNDM investors  many of whom may have endured an uncomfortable ride in the past few years  Five years ago  TNDM shares were trading over  300 after their November 2013 IPO  The company was also getting ready to post 3 consecutive years between 2015 and 2017 of average EPS losses near  25  In that time  shares fell steadily all the way to under  3 in late 2017  You can imagine the pain for investors who were buying  and holding  all the way down based on analyst projections about future sales for the company s new insulin pumps  But patient investors finally found some relief when the Zacks Rank spotted TNDM shares as having the potential of reversing the cash hemorrhaging  As analysts re worked their models  their estimates started rising in 2017 and forecasting a trough of losses  So TNDM became a Zacks  2 Rank Buy several times in the period from Q4 2017 through Q3 2018  And the stock rose from  2 to  52 by September  Here s the Zacks proprietary Price   Consensus chart which plots changes in annual EPS estimates  lhs  against the stock price  rhs   I have circled the rising tide of estimates in 2017 for both that year  lower  darker blue line  and 2018 consensus  upper  lighter blue  which caused TNDM shares to become a Zacks Rank Buy     Another weight on TNDM shares during the recovery was its battle against a Goliath of med tech competition in diabetes  Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT   At one point  an equally giant insurer s updated insulin pump policy  which expanded Medtronic s preferential agreement to patients age 7 and older  was seen as an enormous obstacle for our little David  But some analysts believed the impact on Tandem s growing revenues would be temporary  as the prevailing cry from patients and physicians for more options  not less  would win the day  Those views are being validated now  Investor and Analyst Reaction Since the FDA Approval So far  the price action in the stock since February 14 has been solid  with strong buying volume pushing shares to within 50 cents of last September s 52 week high at  52 55  But actually  shares rallied all last week as some players obviously knew what was coming  with Feb 12 seeing 3 5 million shares trade on the move from  44 to  49  Meanwhile  the analyst reaction has been light too  We should look forward to more investment banks starting coverage of TNDM this year  Here s what we ve heard thus far  courtesy of TheFly com    Piper Jaffray analyst JP McKim kept his Overweight rating and  60 price target on Tandem Diabetes  calling the FDA announcement authorizing the first t slim X2 interoperable insulin pump is a  nice win  for the company  The analyst says the decision allows the company to  go market as the world s first interoperable pump   adding that the feedback on Tandem also continues to be  very strong   Robert Baird analyst Jeff Johnson raised his price target on Tandem Diabetes to  55 from  46 after the company received FDA approval of its t slim X2 pump as an  alternate controller enabled   or ACE  infusion pump  Although the analyst did not raise his estimates  he believes the designation should further differentiate Tandem and de risk the 2020 development timeline for t sport  which he believes can help sustain the company s recent momentum   There has always been the risk that the insulin pump makers are made obsolete by a new oral diabetes medicine  Until those clinical trials are underway  we ll stick with good old fashioned medical technology    and its latest innovations    to provide precision care and flexibility for diabetes patients  Disclosure  I own TNDM shares for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio  Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019 In addition to the stocks

174208,395724,MDT,2 Healthcare Stocks That Could Provide Safety In This Market Downturn,opinion,"In the ongoing bloodbath in equity markets  everyone is looking for safety  That means you need to go back to basics and look for sectors which are immune to interest rate cycles  trade wars and recessions 
Health care stocks are considered defensive because health insurers  pharmaceutical companies  and medical device makers generally perform better in times of economic uncertainty 
Just like retailers  utilities  and garbage collectors  health providers offer services that we can t afford to put off in a recession and economic swings don t typically curb the roll out of new drugs and devices 
That s the reason the S P Health Care Index is up 9 38  this year  outperforming the benchmark S P 500 which has fallen over 2  
Hedge funds have built up their biggest position in health care shares in the past five years  according to Goldman Sachs research cited by The Wall Street Journal in September  About 17  of hedge funds assets were in the healthcare sector  second only to shares of tech companies 
Sustainable Returns
Stocks like Merck   Company Inc  NYSE MRK  and Medtronic Plc  NYSE MDT  are well positioned to not only beat the market in this downturn  but also provide good sustainable returns 
Merck  a global healthcare provider  has so far delivered more than 36  in total returns in a year in which social media giant Facebook has fallen 24  

In October  the drugmaker said it plans to invest  16 billion in new capital projects through 2022  a 33  jump over what it said was its planned spending in February  It also boosted its dividend by 15  to  2 2 a share annually 
The company is benefiting from its top selling cancer drug Keytruda  which brought in  1 89 billion in the third quarter    up 80  from a year ago  With strong earnings momentum  a growing dividend and buybacks  we believe Merck is a good long term bet for buy and hold investors even with its shares trading near its 52 week high 
Medtronic is a less well known healthcare stock that we like due to the company s strong market position and its hefty payouts  The world s biggest medical device maker controls 50  of the global pacemaker market  It s also a leader in products that assist with spinal surgeries and diabetes care 

Medtronic in September paid  1 6 billion to buy Mazor Robotics Ltd  to expand its leadership in the market for spinal surgery through guided robotic procedures 
No matter in which direction the economy goes  stocks like Medtronic will continue to churn out cash  The company has a long term strategy to pay out 50  of its free cash flow to shareholders as dividends  With an almost 15  surge in its shares this year and a  2 a share annual dividend  Medtronic is another solid healthcare stock to stash in your long term portfolio 
Bottom Line
Healthcare stocks  such as Merck and Medtronic  are defensive stocks that could outperform the broader market if we re in for a deep correction and a possible recession in 2019  Diversifying your portfolio with defensive stocks that pay regularly growing dividends is always a good strategy  Healthcare providers are certain to top that list ",2018-12-10,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-healthcare-stocks-that-could-provide-safety-in-this-market-downturn-200366476,200366476

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Medtronic 
For Medtronic  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Medtronic will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Medtronic would post earnings of  1 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of  5 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Medtronic doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/medtronic-mdt-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200358764,200358764

What s Next for Medtronic

174280,395796,MDT,Should Value Investors Consider Medtronic  MDT  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Medtronic has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Medtronic s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Medtronic has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 9  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Medtronic has a P S ratio of about 3 6  This is marginally higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Nonetheless  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MDT is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Medtronic currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Medtronic a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 8  which is far better than the industry average of 20 0  Clearly  MDT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Medtronic might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F  This gives MDT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower  The current fiscal quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to ten lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen one upward and twelve downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 1  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMedtronic is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 30   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors

strategies such as therapy innovation  globalization and increasing the economic value for Medtronic  Combined with the demographics of an aging population  these positives have started to open up

core pacing  ICD  implantable cardioverter defibrillator  and CRT  cardiac resynchronization therapy  product lines within the scope of CRHF  cardiac rhythm and heart failure  while creating new meaningful markets to enhance the company s weighted average market growth Within the TAVR space  the company expects to see continued global growth on strong adoption around the world for Evolut PRO valve as well as expansion in the traditional U S  TAVR centers and U S  share capture resulting from Medtronic s new intermediate risk indication After several quarters of dull Drug Eluting stent  DES  performance in coronary  the company s DES product line witnessed growth in both the United States and Japan since the last couple of quarters  This upside is driven by the recent launch of Resolute Onyx in the said markets  Further  these developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for a strong quarterly performance by the company in the to be reported quarter In fiscal 2018  CVG is projected to rise 5 5 7  with growth pertaining to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on a more favorable prior year comparison  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at  2 77 billion  9  higher than the year ago reported number of  2 54 billion Within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  MITG   surgical innovations should register sturdy growth  driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy  Advanced stapling growth should come on the back of endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri Staple technology as well as Signia  Advanced Energy growth should bank on a continued rollout of the company s LigaSure instruments and Valleylab FT10 energy platform Medtronic expects MITG revenue increase in the range of 3 3 5  in fiscal 2018  Notably  the first half of fiscal 2018 lodged lower MITG rise due to adverse impact from Hurricane Maria  implying an accelerated second half improvement of 3 5 4 5  Within the Restorative Therapies Group  RTG   the company witnesses encouraging developments regarding the brain therapy space  This division experienced a very strong second quarter  driven by high 20s  growth in neurovascular with strength across the entire stroke portfolio  plus a mid teens increase in neurosurgery  We expect this bullish trend to continue in the third quarter as well Medtronic estimates its RTG growth of approximately 3  in fiscal 2018  balancing the impact of Hurricane Maria and in spine market  the projection is flat to slightly down with continued strength in brain therapies  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MITG revenues in the soon to be reported quarter is pegged at  1 91 billion  5 5  higher than the year ago reported figure Overall  Medtronic expects full year revenue growth of 4 5  at CER  Currency fluctuation is expected to leave a positive impact of  275  375 million on fiscal results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at  29 49 billion Adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2018 is expected in the range of 9 10  at CER  Currency translation is expected to adversely impact with a couple of cents  The consensus mark for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at  4 76 Here s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Medtronic does not have the right combination of the two main ingredients   a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1

174364,395880,MDT,5 MedTech Stocks For Stellar Returns In Q3,opinion,"While the Wall Street is gearing up for the third quarter releases  the Republicans have lost another battle pertaining to the repeal of Affordable Care Act  ACA   or Obamacare  with the recent Graham Cassidy bill defeat 
 Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war     President Trump 
However  recent developments suggest that tables might turn again  The President s latest  Executive Order  that aims to exempt certain Association health plans to buy health insurance from the core Obamacare schedule  can take the shape of a serious threat for the healthcare community at large  Also  Rep  Lindsey Graham s promise to revisit the Graham Cassidy legislation deserves a mention here 
Despite these issues  the MedTech industry has so far had a bullish run in 2017  Notwithstanding this  the third quarter is likely to take a hit from the policy debacle  In fact  the latest GOP defeat dampens probabilities of a new Republican healthcare reform with better tax paradigms  any time soon 
Here we take a sneak peek into two other burning issues that are likely to impact the quarterly numbers in the MedTech fraternity 
Tax Woes  At present  the point of focus at the Capitol Hill seems to be tax cuts  The MedTech community had been quite hopeful since the change in presidential power  as Trump s proposed policies have been in favor of the abolition of the infamous 2 3  medical device sales tax  Undoubtedly  abolition of these tax paradigms are far from being achieved 
Added to this  a stronger dollar  pricing and shipping related issues as well as core market challenges are likely to affect the quarterly numbers of MedTech majors this season 
Hurricanes Deal a Blow  Various reports suggest that the unfortunate occurrences of the hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies  primarily in Florida  Texas and Puerto Rico  MedTech major Medtronic   NYSE MDT   acknowledged the impact of the Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics  The company expects almost  250 million impact on revenues and earnings 
Apart from the natural calamities  a rise in unemployment  though short lived  and decline in consumer income coupled with increasing aggregate spending are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers

174385,395901,MDT,Medtronic  MDT  Down 2 7  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Medtronic PLC   NYSE MDT    Shares have lost 2 7  in that time frame  underperforming the market 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts 
Recent EarningsMedtronic reported financial results for first quarter fiscal 2018  Adjusted earnings per share  EPS  in the reported quarter came in at  1 12  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 7  and up 8 7  year over year Adjustments in the quarter primarily included certain impact of restructuring charges  intangible asset amortization and acquisition related items  After adjusting unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 2 cents  adjusted EPS came in at  1 14  up 11  year over year Without these adjustments  the company reported net income of 74 cents per share  up 12 1  year over year Total RevenueWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed  7 39 billion  up 4  on a constant exchange rate or CER basis  up 3  on a reported basis   The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 45 billion  Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronic s fiscal first quarter revenues by  33 million In the quarter under review  U S  sales  55  of total revenue  increased 1  year over year to  4 04 billion  Non U S  developed market revenues totaled  2 31 billion  31  of total revenue   reflecting a 5  increase at CER  up 4  as reported   Emerging markets  14  of total revenue  amounted to  1 04 billion  up 12  at CER  up 11  as reported  Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups  viz  Cardiac   Vascular Group  CVG   Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  MITG   Restorative Therapies Group  RTG  and Diabetes Group CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure  CRHF   Coronary   Structural Heart  CSH  and Aortic   Peripheral Vascular divisions  APV   MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions and the Patient Monitoring   Recovery  PMR  divisions  RTG includes the Spine  Brain Therapies  Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments  while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management  IIM   Non Intensive Diabetes Therapies  NDT   and Diabetes Service   Solutions  DSS  divisions Revenues at CVG improved 6  at CER  or up 5  as reported  to  2 65 billion  driven by strong  balanced growth across all three divisions CRHF sales were  1 39 billion with 5  year over year at CER  up 4  as reported   This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER  amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system  strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope and continued worldwide customer demand for the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor  This apart  the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in the Heart Failure division CSH revenues were up 8  at CER  7  as reported  to  817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe APV revenues registered 5  growth at CER  up 4  as reported  to  439 million  driven by the continued adoption of the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and remarkable strength of the Heli FX EndoAnchor System  Peripheral was driven by low double digit growth in both atherectomy and drug coated balloons In MITG  worldwide sales reached  2 49 billion  marking a 3  year over year increase at CER  same as reported  on mid single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low single digit growth in PMR In RTG  worldwide revenues of  1 81 billion were up 2  year over year at CER  same as reported  on high single digit growth in Brain Therapies  mid single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low single digit growth in Spine  thus mitigating a decline in Pain Therapies  However  revenues from the Diabetes group decreased 1  at CER  same as reported  to  449 million MarginsGross margin during the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points  bps  to 68 2  despite a 2 8  increase in gross profit to  5 04 billion  Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 26 3   This was owing to a 1 4  decline in research and development expenses  to  548 million  which was offset by a 2 3  rise in selling  general and administrative expenses  to  2 49 billion   Other expenses in the reported quarter were  66 million as compared with  39 million in the year ago period GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant currency revenue and EPS guidance  The company still expects full year revenue growth in the range of 4 5  at CER  However  the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation  which is now projected to have a positive  380  480 million impact in the fiscal year compared to an expected positive impact of  75  175 million stated previously  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at  30 72 billion for fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9 10  at CER  Currency translation is now expected to have an adverse impact of 3 cents to a positive impact of 1 cent compared with the earlier expectation of negative impact of approximately 5 10 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at  4 89 Moreover for the second quarter of fiscal 2018  Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of  25  75 million on revenues  Currency translation is expected to have a favorable impact of 0 2 cents on second quarter earnings per share

174402,395918,MDT,MedTech Hangs In The Balance As Obamacare Skinny Repeal Fails ,opinion,Most of the healthcare community has started to rejoice over Capitol Hill s regulatory apprise in the recent past  The way the full Obamacare repeal proposal  Republicans  prime agenda within their healthcare roster  fell flat on its face  was intense  And things got even stagier when the  skinny  repeal bill also failed to get passable support at the Senate We believe the immense support to retain the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare came on the heels of the latest cost estimate released by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation s  JCT   While the Republican bill primarily promises improved insurance coverage from the existing law with significantly lower American premiums  the cost estimate revealed something totally contrary Per the report  if ACA is repealed  the number of uninsured people will increase by 17 million in 2018 from the present uninsured number  This apart  average premium in the nongroup market  for individual policies purchased through marketplaces or directly from insurers  will increase 25  in 2018 Troubled Times for MedTech  While twists and turns continue to unfold at the Capitol Hill  thus boosting the chances of the existing healthcare policy  the scenario within the medical device space is getting gloomier  Amid such political conundrum  market watchers should be keeping a tab on the MedTech space The community had been quite hopeful since the change in power as Trump s proposed policies always talked about the abolition of the infamous 2 3  medical device sales tax  This dreadful tax  which was commonly addressed as  fund of the ACA   simply took a toll on the entire medical device industry  since its enactment in 2013  This tax was imposed on the selling price instead of net profit  amounting to a stupendous sum  wiping out almost a quarter of the profit at medical technology owners A report by FierceMedical Device released at that time revealed that Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   made a payment of  180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014  Medtronic   NYSE MDT    the legacy Covidien  Smith   Nephew   NYSE SNN   paid  112 million   60 million and  25 million  respectively during that year This was the story of the industry forerunners  The position of the smaller companies was much worse  Let alone making profits  they were in fact struggling to survive Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech bigwigs as well as small players  finally  from the beginning of 2015  the U S  House and Senate temporarily suspended it  for two years only   Now  MedTech players find themselves facing a similar situation  from the beginning of 2018 itself   if the policy remains intact We note that voters who are in favor of the ACA are also talking about the abolishment of the Cadillac tax  40  excise tax on high cost healthcare plans   another dreadful fiscal revenue generating means of the Democrats Unfortunately  while the Trump administration has been targeting a complete annulment of this Cadillac tax in the near future  it has not come up with any concrete plan to replace MedTech tax yet  The future of the MedTech fraternity thus hangs in the balance How the MedTech Community Perceived it to Be According to the MedTech community  suspension of MedTech tax would have directly addressed issues like lack of opportunity for research and development  innovation  pipeline development and increased investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products  This would have also helped in boosting job creation and quality of patient care  Accordingly  they are going all out to shelve this tax Going by an article by Peter Sullivan  published in The Hill   following the Congress s failure to approve the repeal of the existing healthcare law  the trade group for medical device companies is launching a new campaign to push lawmakers to repeal ObamaCare s tax on medical devices What Awaits MedTech Players Amid this political cacophony  market watchers have a bearish stance toward the space  While pondering over medical device stocks that stand to gain or lose due to the political gridlock  we find that retention or repeal of Obamacare will actually create a vicious circle within the sector On the one hand  if Obamacare stays  MedTech profit will be hit significantly  thus posing challenges for research and development  which is quite expensive On the other hand  while the repeal of Obamacare will lead to intensive research and development and creation of expensive cutting edge MedTech products  there are questions over its effectiveness  This is because with higher number of uninsured  the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base post enactment  indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices No matter how the policy shapes up  it will prove to be beneficial as well as challenging at the same time for the players within the space  Investors meanwhile can be hopeful about the fact that the overall impact of the existing policy s amendment or retention will not be that appalling as it apparently seems One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be

174446,395962,MDT,Medtronic  MDT  Launches Resolute Onyx DES Device In Japan ,opinion,"Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT    a leading global player in medical technology  services and solutions  is set to make another encouraging move with respect to its highest revenue grossing Cardiovascular segment  Following the successful launch of its highly innovative and sophisticated Drug Eluting Stent  DES   Resolute Onyx in the U S  in May 2017  Medtronic is now planning to start selling it in the high growth Japan market from Jul 10  as per a Cardiovascular Business report released on Jul 7  
This is in line with the company s strategy to focus on research and development of high end medical device products within its core business lines  Notably  the FDA approved Resolute Onyx DES had also received CE mark in Europe in 2014 
Resolute Onyx DES is an upgraded version of Resolute Integrity DES which works on the Core Wire Technology  an evolution of Continuous Sinusoid Technology  CST   Thus  Resolute Onyx DES provides enhanced visibility to surgeons  delivering superior clinical performance 
Interestingly  Medtronic s cardiovascular segment contributed 35 98  to total revenues in fourth quarter fiscal 2017 banking on strong growth in Arrhythmia Management as well as transcatheter aortic valves and HeartWare International acquisition  Moreover  the company s latest development in Japan will help boost the company s performance in this segment 
Medtronic s strategy to gain traction in its Coronary and Structural Heart sub segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Transparency Market Research   Per the report  the global coronary stents market is expected to see a CAGR of 6 6  from 2013 to 2019 
More specifically  the DES market within the Coronary stents market is expanding fast  It is estimated to witness a CAGR of 9 54  in the 2013 2019 period  The market is likely to expand 9  in the U S   10  in the Asia Pacific  and 3 1  in Europe as well as the Rest of the World
We believe the high incidence of atherosclerosis diseases due to unhealthy lifestyle  penetration by the DES providing companies in the untapped markets and increasing awareness among people will continue to stimulate the global acceptance of this technology  In the view of these encouraging factors  we believe that the company s Japanese launch plans for Resolute Onyx is strategic and will broaden its customer base in the densely populated Asia Pacific market 
Though based in a highly fragmented Coronary Stents market  Medtronic faces strong competition from global leaders like Boston Scientific Corp    NYSE BSX    Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   and others  Boston Scientific s PROMUS Element Plus Stent System and Abbott s XIENCE V and XIENCE nano Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System are worth a mention in this regard 
Medtronic has been performing better than the broader  market  gaining 18 2  as compared to the industry s 16 3  over the last six months  It also outperformed the 6 8  gain of the S P 500 market over the same time frame 

Zacks Rank   Key Picks
Medtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked medical stock is Inogen  Inc    NASDAQ INGN    with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Inogen has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 17 5   The stock has gained around 23 5  over the last three months

compensation benefit but excluding charges  for the second quarter of 2017  which were better than  4 39 per share in the year ago quarter United Therapeutics said it has set aside  210 million for a potential settlement with the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to resolve an investigation related to its contribution to non profit organizations that provide financial assistance to patients  thereby violating federal securities laws  In the quarter  the company recorded a  210 million charge as an estimated loss contingency in relation to this matter  It also recorded an impairment charge related to cost method investments in a privately held company  which experienced an event triggering an impairment analysis Including these charges and stock based compensation benefit  the company incurred a loss of  1 25 per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 61 by 134 63  Revenues for the reported quarter rose 8  year over year to  445 0 million and beat the Zacks

treatment of pediatric patients with high risk neuroblastoma  sales of  16 1 million were down 10  year over year Lately  the growth of United Therapeutics  PAH drugs Orenitram  Tyvaso and Remodulin have slowed down due to competition  Last quarter  the company had said that patients were staying longer on front line oral AMBITION therapy  Adcirca   Gilead Sciences  Inc  s   NASDAQ GILD

earnings call  management had said that the longer use of oral therapies resulted in a large backlog of patients eligible for prostacyclin therapy like its PAH medicines   suggesting that sales trends could improve  With sales of Tyvaso  Remodulin and Orenitram improving in the second quarter from first quarter levels  management believes that it is seeing early signs of this transition from ambition regimen back to its PAH drugs Research and development  R D  expenses  including stock based compensation benefit  increased 70  to  59 8 million due to higher costs to support its pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop organ manufacturing projects Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses  including stock based compensation benefit  declined 7  to  67 4

174461,395977,MDT,Is Medtronic  MDT  A Suitable Value Pick Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Medtronic PLC   NYSE MDT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Medtronic has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 30  This level compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 34 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Medtronic s current PE near its highs  with the number having been on a general uptrend over the past few months in particular Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Medical   Products  trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 62  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  In fact  Medtronic has historically always traded at a PE less than that of the industry s since the end of 2013 We should also point out that Medtronic has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 18 04  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Medtronic stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Medtronic has a P S ratio of about 4 13  This is a bit higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 94 right now If anything  Medtronic is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Medtronic s P CF ratio of 17 62 is lower than the Zacks classified Medical   Products industry average of 20 21  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Medtronic currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Medtronic an apt choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 2 42  lower than the industry average of 3 80  Clearly  MDT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Medtronic might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives MDT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards lately  The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward revisions and seven downward revisions in the same time period This has had a modest impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 4 4  in the past month  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite somewhat strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMedtronic is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Although

174503,396019,MDT,MedTech Industry Stock Outlook   December 2016,opinion,"Fate of U S  Healthcare  Trump Policies to Replace Obamacare
The United States is clearly divided into  we need  and  don t need  when it comes to existing healthcare policy  Currently we envision the change not just a makeover  but a high chance of full retraction and replacement of Obamacare  And most economists believe that the transition is not going to be an easy one 
Why a Strong  No  to Obamacare 
A number of times during his presidential campaign  Donald Trump labeled Affordable Care Act  ACA  as a disaster which requires immediate  less expensive replacement  According to him  Obamacare is replete with special interest handouts  budget gimmicks and tax increases  all leading to higher premiums and deductibles with reduced access to care  In particular  he talked about the adversities of the Medicaid expansion plan and the two highly controversial taxes   the  Cadillac plan  and the temporarily repealed medical device tax 
Replacement Outlined by the Republicans at a Glance
The President elect recently released a sketch of his healthcare offers which highlight a patient centric healthcare system endorsing choice  quality and affordability with health insurance and healthcare  According to him  the new policy aims at taking necessary actions to alleviate the burdens imposed on American families and businesses by the law  
He also talked about Health Savings Accounts  HSAs   a tax exempt account in which anyone can deposit funds on one s behalf  and about his plan to once again return the role of regulating health insurance to the States  According to the plan  the States  with maximized flexibility in administering Medicaid  can go for innovative methods to deliver healthcare to low income citizens  Also  the plan aims to modernize Medicare to better cope with the pressure of the imminent retirement of the Baby Boom generation 
What the Nation Is Thinking
We await a detailed Trump action plan and are not yet clear on how Obamacare  which has extended health insurance to 21 million Americans  can totally be substituted  Don t forget  this was the plan that drove the rate of the uninsured to an historic low 
According to a survey released by the Pew Research Center  54  of Americans disapprove of the 2010 ACA while 44  favor it  However  US News reported that though more Americans say they oppose the law than support it  data also show that people find certain provisions of the law favorable  including mandating coverage to those with pre existing conditions and allowing children to stay on a parent s plan until age 26 
MedTech Is Hopeful
The Republican win marked a great victory for the entire medical device industry as the likelihood of a permanent repeal of the 2 3  medical device excise tax will come as a big bonus for both the behemoths and the small players  According to medical device trade association AdvaMed  the entire MedTech fraternity is looking forward to the new policymakers who are expected be work toward improving the FDA regulatory process  repealing the medical device tax  and ensuring that the coverage process allows patient access to the latest innovations 
According to the MedTech community  the repeal of this dreadful tax  commonly referred to as  fund of the ACA  will directly address issues like lack of opportunity in research and development  innovation  pipeline development and in making investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products  This will also help in boosting job creation and quality of patient care  enabling the companies to strengthen their position to cope with any new situation that they can after this two year period 
MedTech Trend at a Glance
Let us now keep aside the political game change and its consequences and see what s there in it for MedTech investors to gain from  While this sector is generally not in the limelight from an investment perspective  what makes it a compelling choice in this extremely volatile global market is its fundamental defensive nature  Products of this sector are mostly essential and hence less sensitive to business cycle fluctuations 
A recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview claims that the MedTech space is positioned for impressive growth in the near term  Worldwide  Medtech sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5 2  to  529 8 billion by 2022 
Steering ahead of Cardiology and Diagnostics  In Vitro Diagnostics  IVD  is expected to emerge as the sector leader in 2022  13 4  of the industry s total sales   Neurology  meanwhile  holds promise as the fastest growing division by 2022  CAGR of 7 6    On the other hand  Orthopedics  which is already going downhill  may prove to be one of the slowest growing segments in 2022 with a CAGR of 3 8  per year 
While Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  was the largest device maker of 2014  the picture altered last year following Medtronic s  MDT   50 billion acquisition of Covidien  Medtronic  NYSE MDT  is expected to retain this position in 2022 with a revenue forecast of  39 9 billion 
While Medtronic enjoys a competitive edge with its huge and growing Cardiac and Vascular portfolio  J J s forte lies in the orthopedic space  24 1  of market share in 2022   However Zimmer Biomet  ZBH  is fast catching up to be the second lead in the orthopedic market with 20 6  share by 2022  Roche  RHHBY   as usual  is expected to remain the leading player in the IVD market in 2022  too

	Chicago  IL   December 05  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the MedTech  Part 3  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   NYSE     Medtronic  NYSE MDT   NYSE     Zimmer Biomet  NYSE     and Nxstage Medical  Inc   NASDAQ      

	Industry  MedTech  Part 3

	Link  

	Three full quarters of 2016 are behind us and  as expected  the trend has hardly changed for the bullish MedTech sector even amid severe economic instability surrounding one of the most controversial political power changes in history  This is because some powerful long term tailwinds like mergers   acquisitions  M A   emerging market expansion  positive demographic trends and new product innovation are the vital forces behind the continued uptrend in the sector s performance 

	In addition  the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for ensuring efficient patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value based model 

	Let s go through some of the major long term tailwinds of the MedTech sector 

Major M As

	By now we know how Medtronic  NYSE      knocked Johnson   Johnson  NYSE      from its indisputable position as the top firm in the medical devices space  thanks to its  43 billion Covidien merger  It s really amazing how a single mega consolidation shook up the dynamics of the entire medical devices space 

	And after that the industry hasn t taken a breather with strategic mega consolidations continuing to pour in  Deals like Zimmer Biomet  NYSE        Johnson   Johnson Synthes  Thermo Fisher Life Technologies and many more gave birth to unprecedented leaders in their respective niche markets 

	Also  Zimmer Biomet s impending acquisition of LDR Holding Corp  for a total deal value of  1 billion is expected to boost the spine portfolio of the former 

Emerging Market Openings

	As per recent data from Euromonitor International  the global medical device production value is likely to register strong growth of almost 6  in 2016  to reach  315 billion  While the traditional market continues to be plagued by difficulties like growing regulatory scrutiny and pricing pressure  it s the Asia Pacific region on which all bets are being placed this year 

	The MedTech market in Asia Pacific grew the fastest at a CAGR of 10  during 2008 2014 and is expected to continue to grow rapidly over 2016 as well  According to the report  China and India s healthcare service revenues are expected to grow by 12  and 9   respectively  in 2016 alone 

	Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In the third quarter of 2016  sales in key emerging markets climbed in double digits driven by growth in India  China and Latin America 

	At Medtronic  emerging markets demonstrated strong growth in its second quarter of fiscal 2017  contributing 120 basis points  bps  to the company s overall revenue growth  Boston Scientific Corp   NYSE BSX  achieved 19  organic growth in emerging markets in the third quarter  driven by 26  growth in China and 21  growth in Latin America 

Strongest Links

	Among the medical product stocks  Nxstage Medical  Inc   NASDAQ      looks attractive  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and with a VGM score B  We note that  stocks with a  of A or B and a Zacks Rank of  1 or  2 have highest probability of success 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

In fiscal 2017  given the current trends  the company once again expects revenues to grow in the range of 5  to 6  on a CCCW basis  This also remains consistent with the company s long term  mid single digit constant currency revenue growth expectation  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at  29 88 billion for fiscal 2017 
Our Take
Medtronic s first quarter earnings edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues came close to our expectation  The consolidated company demonstrated strong segmental performances at CCCW basis  displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets 
All four major business groups contributed to solid top line growth on CCCW basis which  according to the company  highlighted sustainability across groups and regions  We are also encouraged with the solid growth trend successfully continuing in the U S  as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies  Apart from product innovation  the company is currently focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses 
The company was successful in generating significant free cash flow  which management plans to reinvest in future growth opportunities while also providing strong returns to its shareholders

174599,396115,MDT,Medtronic Launches MiniMed 630G  Expands In Diabetic Care  revised ,opinion,"Medical device major Medtronic  NYSE MDT  plc s    MiniMed 630G system with SmartGuard technology   a new insulin pump that facilitates diabetes care   recently won the U S  FDA  Food and Drug Administration  approval for its commercial launch in the U S  This system will be useful particularly on people aged sixteen years or more 
The MiniMed 630G basically combines SmartGuard technology which is already featured in the MiniMed 530G system with a brand new user friendly design  We note that  the SmartGuard technology acts against low blood sugar and is the only system at present to reduce the frequency of night time low episodes by one third 
We believe this system will receive huge market acceptance taking into consideration the fact that up to 75  of severe hypoglycemia occurs during night time while patients are asleep 
MiniMed 630G has a user friendly design which enables personalized diabetes management and also provides advanced clinical performance  Apart from that  this system  unlike the other members of the MiniMed family uses the Contournext Link 2 4  the blood glucose meter of Ascensia Diabetes Care which claims to provide accurate blood glucose test results 
We note that  with rapidly rising incidents of diabetes across the U S   healthcare organizations are now focused on innovating technologies that will effectively help the nation s 29 1 million diabetics manage their health conditions  Remarkably  diabetes has been growing at an exponential rate lately with the global diabetic population expected to reach 552 million by 2030 from 366 million in 2011  With such a scenario looming  disease management and providing optimal therapy has become a major challenge for healthcare providers 
Medtronic is leaving no stone unturned to consolidate its position as a leading holistic diabetes management company in the U S  In this regard  we should refer to the company s global  multi year collaboration with Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Life  a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated  to jointly develop future generation continuous glucose monitoring  CGM  systems that aspire to improve health outcomes for people with diabetes 
Other major medical device companies that are prominent players in the diabetic space are Becton  Dickinson and Company     DexCom  Inc     and Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT      among others

The sector has also been able to navigate the recent health care sector changes with ease and it has maintained a nice history of outperformance  We can see this by looking at Medtronic  NYSE MDT  which also seen a nice run over the past two years  However  as we note in the chart below  the performance has really just been in line with the industry at large 

While this was fine for a while  MDT will have to deliver the goods eventually  And with an incredible run to start 2016  this quarter could be a very important one for Medtronic 
This is especially true given the recent estimate trend for MDT shares  Coming into the report earnings estimates have been declining a little bit  and the stock actually was just downgraded into  hold  territory too MEDTRONIC Price and Consensus   
But  there shouldn t be too much of a concern about liking up to expectations  as the company is riding a nice streak in earnings season  In fact  the company hasn t missed estimates since mid 2014  so it definitely knows how to live up to expectations MEDTRONIC Price and EPS Surprise   
Overall  it looks like MDT has a decent chance to beat  but investors shouldn t expect the world from this stock in the report as estimates haven t been too great lately  Still  the nice history in earnings season and the very impressive industry rank should help to carry this over the hump for the coming report  But this one  more than most this quarter  will likely be a case where guidance will make or break the stock  and especially considering its market beating gain to start 2016

174617,396133,MDT,MedTech Industry Stock Outlook   July 2016,opinion,"Two full quarters of 2016 are behind us and  while we await second quarter results over the coming weeks  we hardly expect a change in trend in the bullish MedTech sector  This comes as no surprise  even in the face of severe economic instability  fierce competition and increasing cost related hazards leading to regulatory complexities  This is because the medical device industry remains healthy on successful execution of some top strategic priorities  two of which are R D and product development 
According to a survey by KPMG  the number of medical device companies that expect to spend more than 6  of revenue on R D innovation is rising and is fast exceeding the number of companies spending on R Ds in other manufacturing industries  These innovations and breakthroughs can be of various forms   new products or surgical techniques or cost effective products targeting the emerging markets  These innovations  however  have one thing in common  they are meant to transform the way MedTech reaches the consumer 
Edwards Lifesciences   EW  SAPIEN or its competitive product Medtronic s  MDT  CoreValvetranscatheter heart valve or surgical aortic valves are good examples of such breakthrough innovations  As the global heart valves market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14 28  during the period 2016 2020  according to the latest Market Research Report   it is needless to say how impactful these breakthroughs are for the MedTech market to remain on its growth trajectory 
Other remarkable breakthroughs include 3D printing  minimally invasive surgical procedures involving both robotics and 3D visual systems  new materials like the preventive premature failure of hip implant coatings  and so forth  Information technology  utilization of smart devices cloud connectivity and personalized medicine are newfound fields which are pushing the medical device industry toward rapid and sustainable growth 
Impressive Prospects Ahead
R D and product development are just the tip of the iceberg  The future of MedTech lies in other catalysts as well  According to economists  strategic partnerships and M As are in fact the driving force behind breakthrough innovations compared to the singlehanded contribution of in house efforts 
They asserted that strategic consolidations are very often seen as the gateway for new business models apt for a highly competitive and specialized industry leading to all new levels of R D investments 
Let us now deliberate on what investors might gain from the MedTech world  a sector that is generally not in the limelight from an investment perspective  The primary fact which compels us to bet on MedTech  especially in this extremely volatile world market  is its fundamentally defensive nature  Products of this sector are mostly essential and hence less sensitive to business cycle fluctuations 
And we ve found some pretty impressive data in this respect 
A recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview claims that the MedTech space is positioned for impressive growth in the near term  At a glance  MedTech sales worldwide are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1  to  477 5 billion by 2020 
Steering ahead of Cardiology and Diagnostics  In Vitro Diagnostics  IVD  is expected to emerge as the sector leader in 2020  Neurology  meanwhile  holds promise as the fastest growing division among the top 15 segments by 2020  On the other hand  Orthopedics  which is already on shaky legs  may prove to be one of the slowest growing segments in 2020 with a CAGR of 3 2  per year 
While Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  was the largest device maker of 2014 with MedTech sales of  27 5 billion  the honor may go to Medtronic  NYSE MDT  by 2020 with its business consolidated by the Covidien acquisition  Medtronic is expected to reach the top with revenues mounting to  34 9 billion in 2020 
While Medtronic s growing Cardiac and Vascular portfolio lends it a sharp competitive edge  J J s forte lies in its orthopedic capability  which unfortunately is not gaining much traction among investors  CAGR of 2 4  between 2014 and 2020  lower than the expected market growth rate

174619,396135,MDT,FDA Okays Medtronic s NuVent For Expanded Use In Sinusitis,opinion,"Medtronic plc s   NYSE MDT   NuVent EM sinus dilation system recently got an expanded indication clearance from the FDA  The approval will now allow this first of its kind balloon sinus dilation system to treat patients in need for revision sinus surgery  RSS  
Notably  the NuVent system was originally launched in the U S   back in Aug 2014  to aid in minimally invasive  balloon sinus surgery in patients suffering from chronic sinusitis  On account of the expanded clearance from the FDA  U S  physicians can now use this system on patients on whom traditional sinus surgery has failed 
Sinusitis   Benefits of NuVent
Sinusitis is a common medical condition involving the inflammation of sinuses and nasal passages and it approximately affects 31 million U S  citizens each year  Chronic sinusitis  an advanced stage of this disease affects approximately 15  of the U S  population and is one of the most common chronic illnesses in America 
For those at the initial stage of the condition  medication is the most preferred treatment option  However  sinus surgery is generally reserved for chronic sinusitis patients who become unresponsive to drug therapy   
Traditional sinus surgery is a minimally invasive procedure involving the removal of obstructive sinus tissues to improve natural nasal drainage  Still since sinus anatomy can vary widely among patients  surgical navigation plays an important role in sinus surgeries 
Interestingly  Medtronic s NuVent is a unique balloon sinus dilation system incorporating a built in electromagnetic  EM  surgical navigation technology  which enables a better view of one s sinus anatomy and the optimal placement of balloons during surgery 
Furthermore  NuVent has been integrated to work with Medtronic s image guidance technology called the Fusion ENT Navigation System  which acts like a GPS navigator in specifically targeting blocked sinuses during the sinus surgeries 
In the worst case scenario  often times the sinus surgery fails to cure the chronic sinusitis patient and can start posing unique challenges due to potential scar tissue and altered anatomy from the surgery  Subsequently  a revision surgery is performed on such patients 
The recent results of a prospective  single arm study conducted at investigational sites in the U S   demonstrated the devices  safety and effectiveness in successfully performing the revision surgery  This in turn earned this device the expanded indication clearance from FDA and thus is now allowed to perform surgery on sinusitis patients with scarred  granulated  or previously surgically altered tissue 
Our Take
With chronic sinusitis being a widespread medical condition  Medtronic s ingenious surgical tool   the NuVent system   surely comes as a boon for patients who continue to suffer from the symptoms even after undergoing the sinus surgery and therefore need to undergo a revised one 
While performing a revised sinus surgery  often the physicians face technical challenges particularly associated with the frontal sinus  Encouragingly  though NuVent now offers a 70  angled frontal probe  which is a familiar angle for sinus surgery  coupled with the Fusion navigation system 
Not only does this device overcome the technical challenges involved with the revised surgery thereby improving outcomes for concerned patients  but also effectively reduce their out of pocket costs when the procedure is performed in a physician s office  As insurance companies  usually do not reimburse the patients for undergoing in office surgical procedures  making this device also a cost effective one  
 Of late  the management has witnessed a stronger mid single digit growth in the U S  outpatient surgery market  which in turn boosted the company s revenue growth in Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  With the minimally invasive surgical instruments market projected to reach  18 1 billion by 2021  at a CAGR of 10 2  from 2016  we expect the recent FDA approval for its NuVent system will surely increase Medtronic s shares in this market as well as its MITG revenue

Industry  MedTech  Part 2

Link  

Over the past few years  the U S  medical device market has undergone a substantial transformation  While there are a lot of thorny regulatory and financial issues that hardly look resolved anytime soon  the powerful long term tailwinds  including mergers   acquisitions  emerging market expansion  positive demographic trends and new product innovation have been the vital force behind the continued uptrend of the sector s performance 

In addition  the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics have led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value based model  among others 

Adding to the advantage is the temporary two year suspension of the controversial and dreadful 2 3  medical device excise tax which took a toll on the entire MedTech industry since its enactment in 2013 Data published in a report in FierceMedical Device stated that in 2014  Johnson   Johnson     made a payment of  180 million in medical device tax payments  while Medtronic     legacy Covidien and Smith   Nephew     paid  112 million   60 million and  25 million  respectively 

Let s go through some of the major long term tailwinds of the MedTech sector  These include M A  Divestment and Emerging Market 

M A Boom Continues

Going by the last available EvaluateGroup data  the first half of 2015 saw 86 mergers and acquisitions  totaling  83 billion  a rise of 166  from the year ago period  Although the next report is not yet released  the unofficial talk is that the full year target of  100 billion of M A valuation was effortlessly reached with the legacy continuing into 2016 

Medtronic     after its path breaking  42 9 billion acquisition of Irish rival Covidien  in Jan 2015   has not taken a breather from strategic M As  Among many others  the company recently entered into an  for a total value of  1 1 billion  This acquisition is expected to significantly boost Medtronic s cardiac rhythm and heart failure business  alongside providing a strong foothold in the global niche 

Some other significant consolidation deals of recent times are discussed below 

Abbott Laboratories      St  Jude Medical       In April  Abbott announced its decision to consolidate with St  Jude Medical for a deal value of  25 billion  Post completion  this will create a leader in high growth cardiovascular markets  including atrial fibrillation  structural heart and heart failure as well as earn a leading position in the high growth neuromodulation market

174647,396163,MDT,Why It Feels Like Inflation,opinion,"Last night s  on the US stock market ended as follows 

 As far as the Fed and its puny rate hikes are concerned  that is irrelevant  This market is flipping them the bird  Markets can rise a long way before a rate hike regime finally kills them  It feels like inflation folks  

This prompted a question from an  subscriber about what markets would benefit  and in what differing ways would they benefit if an inflationary phase comes to dominate  That is a far reaching question and a difficult one as well  because inflation s effects have a way of being unpredictable  how many would have answered  US stock market  in the spring of 2011 to the question  where will the post crisis inflation to date manifest on this cycle    
Last weekend  in an NFTRH 396 excerpt we talked about Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT  stellar quarterly report and what it might mean for the economy  the Fed  the gold sector and most of all the idea of an inflationary backdrop becoming more readily apparent  2003 2007 Greenspan style  

 SOX SPX above and SOX NDX below are still each in post 2012  leadership abdication  mode  technically speaking  If that changes and the Book to Bill changes trend  we will need to evolve our plans from counter cyclical to  inflationary growth   which was the phase that held sway for several years into the big market top in 2007  

The   released May 24  took a big jump this week  data for April  and the Canary in a Coal Mine s Canary  Semi Equipment is an earlier cyclical signpost than the broad Semi sector  which itself is often an early cycle leader  is chirping in similar fashion to late 2012 early 2013 when Semiconductor market leadership began 
As for the Semiconductor index  its leadership has wobbled through the market disturbances of the last year  While still at resistance both in ratio to the S P 500 and nominally  the last week has obviously been very constructive 

In the quote above we note that a Semi cycle and its implications would pretty much kill the counter cyclical atmosphere that launched the gold sector  as did the 2001 2002 cycle  and likely signal a phase of inflationary economic growth  Now  no single indicator can be used to forecast an economy or the markets  but a strengthening Semi sector would be consistent with a growth phase  Again  ref  Greenspan era circa 2003 2007 
In answer to the subscriber s question about where to invest for inflation I would not profess to be the answer man on a subject with as many variables as global Central Banks  panicked and spraying market friendly policy 24 7 through monetary fire hoses for years on end  Again   inflationary effects  is its own animal and capital will fly to various destinations at varying times  The disgusting NIRP policy cooked up in Japan and Europe has the potential to scare people so badly that distortions will likely build in certain asset markets 
A final note before reviewing the US market as an inflationary investment destination  we will talk about other  more tradition  inflation trades  like precious metals  commodities and emerging markets this weekend in NFTRH 397   Think the US is relatively sound today in its policy stance  Well sure  they have boosted the Fed Funds rate by  25   What s more  they likely have another one or two 1 4 points to come in 2016  But please consider the years of QE s 1 3 and the 7 year run of ZIRP  The inflation was already built in to the structure  as manifested in the US stock market  On that note  for this article we ll look at said US stock market  the prime beneficiary of inflation through 2015 
 Inflation Trade  Candidates  US Stock Market
Again  see the first link above  The market is on the verge of negating the bear trend of lower highs and lower lows  While some indexes  like the mid caps  have already done so and the cumulative Advance Decline line on the NYSE have been bullish  most indexes remain below their April highs  If they rise above that and close a week that way  the end of the bearish phase would be indicated 
If this happens  where to invest in the US  If the US dollar weakens anew   it remains in a bearish intermediate technical situation despite the current bounce  people should consider manufacturers and exporters  Also  as noted previously  progressive Semiconductor manufacturers  beaten down Healthcare situations and the Energy Sector  which we showed to have been in an unbroken secular bull market last year in anticipation of the coming bottom and updated in early January just before the bottom   
Here is a chart we have updated each week in NFTRH showing some relatively constructive sectors amid the bearishness in general US markets  What the heck were Medical Devices doing so bullish during the onset of a bear cycle  Well  in my previous life in manufacturing I had always noted our primary customer base  medical device equipment companies  were reliably strong throughout the business cycle  NFTRH  s Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX   profit taken  and Medtronic  NYSE MDT   ongoing  are just two of many prospects in this area 

It is important to remember that in the Greenspan inflation the economy did just fine  At that time we had theDow Gold ratio and charts like it to put the lie  it was inflation  not productive growth  to it  In 2016 we have had the beginnings of a similar situation  although gold is correcting vs  stocks  and most other assets  lately 
  But with the Fed in a rate hiking stance the dollar should gain strength  no  No  there is no need for that to happen  We are talking about inflationary inputs that went on for years upon years that were masked by a global deflation  resulting in a US Goldilocks atmosphere  Maybe that will be the case again  but if gold  silver and commodities have indeed bottomed as I believe they have  then we may yet see a Greenspan style phase  Notice how the best part of the 2003 2007  inflation bull  came after Greenie began a rate hike regime 

We should wrap up because this post is getting long in the tooth  Assuming the week closes in similar status  constructive activity across many asset classes  we will look further  in NFTRH  into the prospects for various US stock market sectors  global considerations like emerging markets  and assets like commodities and precious metals 
This article is simply a  look ahead  because we do not yet have confirmations on a bullish turn in stocks and indeed  the goings on in the Semiconductor equipment sector have instigated the current line of thinking much more than something as choppy and erratic  lately  as the stock market has  As a  look ahead  this is by no means a call to inflationary action  It is just part of a process of trying to understand which way the macro is likely to go in the coming months and possibly  years 
Meanwhile  let s leave the article with a look at the sensitive inflation indicator  silver vs  gold  It is a nice inter market companion to the early economic signal in the Semi sector  The daily chart of Silver Gold has been flagging down to support  Has it found support yet or will silver correct further vs  gold  An open question  but what is near certain is that if an inflationary phase is to engage Silver Gold will once again rise  So keep it in view ",2016-05-27,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/it-feels-like-inflation-200132522,200132522

174670,396186,MDT,Thematic ETFs  Smarter Than Regular Smart Beta ETFs ,opinion,"It s been a true transformation for the ETF industry over the last few years  With a size of   the global ETF industry hit a record at the end of April 2016  The U S  market alone boasts a size of over  2 2 trillion  derived from over 1 890 exchange traded products 
	While this joy ride is something to delight in  crinkles of worries must be there on the foreheads of issuers  After all  with such gigantic and successful progress  ideas of new issuances are likely to fall short  There is always pressure for beating the benchmark  navigating tough trading times and last but not the least peer pressure 
	Simply put  the days of plain vanilla ETFs or market cap weighted ETFs are gone and products with several wining attributes  like low volatility or high dividend  are coming on stream  Commonly  these next generation ETFs are called smart beta ETFs 
	But it seems that the lure for smart beta investing is also diminishing these days  Beating the benchmark on a sustainable basis is tough in the present global backdrop that is fraught with issues  Plus  first time craze also ebbs when a new investing theme turns older  read    
	Probably  this is why issuers are fine tuning the smart beta concepts to make them smarter  For example  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  introduced the ActiveBeta Index concept  Global X has a suite of scientific beta ETFs and so on  read    
	In fact  to make things more competitive and take them a few notches higher  Global X got itself busy in promoting the Thematic investing and launching more products based on it Inside Thematic Investing
	As per Global X  its family of thematic ETFs looks to track companies that reap returns from    technology and innovation  and natural resources  along with companies that exhibit a particular set of desirable values  
	As we can see that the above mentioned criteria is long term in nature and less susceptible to sudden changes in economic policies of various countries or a sudden jerk in the market emanating from some geo political crisis  Instead  these factors look to cash in on some emerging trend in the global economy  As an investor  if you have faith in a particular segment over the long term  only then you should go ahead with that product 
	As of now  Global X has four categories in its thematic investment  namely technology  resources  values and people  Not that these ideas are fool proof as products in technology and resources segments piled up losses previously  but new entrees in people and values segments seem striking at the current level  We ll tell you why People Products Global X Millennials Thematic ETF   
	This recently launched ETF looks to track companies targeted at the U S  millennials generation  birth years ranging from 1980 2000   Since millennials seem to be the growth driver of the U S  economy  outpacing baby boomers in 2015 as the largest generation and has the prospect of comprising  by 2025  this surely emerges as a long term bet  Per   millennials now earn about  2 trillion  with income projected to grow to  8 trillion by 2025 
	Since millennials have a tendency of splurging on tech savvy products and eating out  several tech or consumer discretionary ETFs can give MILN little competition Global X Health   Wellness Thematic ETF   
	There is a visible shift in consumers  taste and preference for health and wellness products which give people a better quality of life  It is already   As global life expectancy is projected to surge by 18  by 2100  contribution of health and wellness companies ought to be higher  This explains why investors can have a look at BFIT which revolves around stocks like Whitewave Foods Co  Adidas AG  DE ADSGN   Herbal Life Ltd  etc Global X Longevity Thematic ETF   
	This new fund tracks companies which depend on people across the globe living longer lives  Now  since older people invest more in health care related products and services  health care will rule this fund  Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX   Abbvie and Medtronic  NYSE MDT  are the top three firms of this ETF 
	As a matter of fact  this fund may face tough competition from other health care and biotech ETFs like iShares Global Healthcare ETF     iShares U S  Healthcare ETF and Guggenheim S P 500 Equal Weight Health Care ETF    Values Product
	There is only one fund as yet  namely Global X S P 500 Catholic Values ETF

174709,396225,MDT,Johnson   Johnson  A Safe Pick In A Dangerous Market,opinion,"As I wrote earlier this year  I m long term bullish on this market  but stretched valuations in certain parts of the market  like cloud stocks and social media stocks  are at major risk of blowing up  With many momentum stocks appearing to peter out  investors could do a lot worse than investing in a blue chip stock like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ     98 share  when it s valued at such a cheap price 
Diversification Leads to Consistent Profits
JNJ sells a massive variety of products from Band Aids and Tylenol to joint reconstruction products  This diversification gives JNJ s profits a greater consistency than other companies  When one product struggles  it has others to make up the difference  This consistency explains why JNJ has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 10  compounded annually for the past 15 years  Its NOPAT has not declined in any year over that timeframe 
The diversification of JNJ s revenue streams is truly impressive  JNJ operates in three segments  Consumer  Pharmaceutical  and Medical Devices  Medical Devices is the largest segment with  28 5 billion in sales  40  of revenues   The largest product within Medical Devices  Orthopaedics  makes up only  9 5 billion  or 13  of total revenues  It also happens to be one of JNJ s fastest growing product groups  with 22  revenue growth in 2013 
JNJ s diversified product portfolio gives it a leg up on its competitors  which we can see through its superior return on invested capital  ROIC   JNJ s ROIC of 15  is higher than competitors like Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  at 10   Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  at 5   or Medtronic Inc  NYSE MDT  at 13  
Reported Earnings Understate Profits
People who read my research regularly know that reported earnings are not a good indicator of the core operating profitability of a business  GAAP rules were designed for debt investors  not equity investors  and often include unusual or non operating items that obscure the true profitability of a company  We ve made over 57 000 adjustments to reported income statements and balance sheet based on annual reports filed in the last two months  These adjustments are necessary to analyze a company s true economic earnings 
Figure 1 shows how  in the past two years  JNJ s reported income has understated its NOPAT  whereas for the rest of its history NOPAT and GAAP net income have been nearly identical  For most companies  NOPAT is regularly higher than net income since it excludes interest expense  but since JNJ has such a large cash pile compared to its debt  interest income and interest expense nearly cancel out  In a regular year  JNJ s income and NOPAT would be similar  but unusual expenses have artificially depressed JNJ s accounting earnings 
GAAP vs  NOPAT

Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings

Two major unusual items accounted for this disconnect in 2013  One was a  600 million impairment charge related to in process research and development  The other charge was  2 5 billion for  Other  Income  Expense   which consisted primarily of litigation expenses  While one doesn t like to see write downs and lawsuits  they are unavoidable for a health care company of JNJ s size 
In fact JNJ compares favorably to its competitors when we look at these expenses  JNJ has accumulated asset write downs equivalent to 6  of net assets  which is below Bristol Myers  23   Medtronic s 7   or Pfizer s 16  
Looking back over JNJ s history  we can see significant fluctuation in these charges  and see that both were on the high end in 2013 for JNJ  Over the past 10 years  JNJ s in process research and development charge has averaged   370 million per year  while its  Other  Income  Expense  has only been   420 million a year  Investors who look just at reported earnings for JNJ miss the fact that expenses are inflated by these unusually high charges 
Strong Growth Opportunities
The world is getting older  not just in the U S   but also internationally  where JNJ earns 55  of its revenue  An aging population means greater spending on health care  and we can already see the benefit for JNJ with the growth of its orthopaedics products and the 11  sales growth last year in its Pharmaceutical segment 
Even better  JNJ has a strong pipeline of new products that it s rolling out  both in the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices segments  In Pharmaceuticals  the European Medicines Agency has recommended granting marketing authorization for Vokanamet  JNJ s Type 2 diabetes treatment  and in Medical Devices  the FDA approved JNJ s SmartTouch Catheter  which is used for patients with heart rhythm disorders 
These products are just the tip of the iceberg  JNJ is also using its significant resources to invest in smaller biotech companies  like Alector  a startup trying to develop new therapies for Alzheimer s  Getting drugs successfully through the approval process and to the market can be a bit of a lottery sometimes  and with its strong cash flow and significant cash on the balance sheet  JNJ can afford to buy more tickets than almost anyone else 
In the Consumer segment  JNJ s brands give it a fairly wide moat  Familiarity is important for over the counter medicines  skin care products  and nutritional products that consumers are going to be putting into their body  JNJ has some of the best brand awareness in the business  with some of its brands  like Band Aid  Listerine  and Neosporin  becoming synonymous with the product itself  These basic consumer products are resistant to economic setbacks and should continue to deliver steady  if modest  growth 
Cheap Valuation
The biggest knock on JNJ from investors is its valuation  which the market perceives to be on the high end  Investors will point to its P E of 19  which is higher than PFE at 15 or MDT at 17  as a reason not to buy the stock  However  the simple P E ratio misses a great deal and understates the value in JNJ 
First of all  as I mentioned above  the earnings side of P E was distorted in 2013 by unusual costs  While reported earnings were  13 8 billion  JNJ actually earned a NOPAT of  15 3 billion  I m reminded of my interview with former   When I asked him what he thought about the focus on accounting earnings in the market  he replied 
 I m not a big fan of earnings multiples  of P E multiples and things like that  We have made over time dramatic changes in the accounting that affect the denominator of the P E ratio  but it s not clear whether and how that flows through the valuations  
In addition to the issues with JNJ s accounting earnings  P E also ignores another significant aspect of shareholder value  the balance sheet  JNJ s  28 billion in excess cash more than covers its debt and pension liabilities  This cash represents potential shareholder value  either through stock buybacks or investment in new growth opportunities  The  4 2 billion sale of its diagnostics unit  which has been in decline  will give JNJ even more cash to work with 
Our calculation of price to economic book value  PEBV  captures all these factors by comparing the company s stock price to the perpetuity value of the current cash flows  NOPAT  of the business assuming zero growth  What we find is that JNJ has a PEBV of 1 1  which implies that the company will only grow NOPAT by 10  for the remainder of its corporate life  Remember  this is a company that has grown NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for the fifteen years that my model covers 
Even with relatively modest growth  JNJ has significant potential upside  If the company can grow NOPAT by just 6  compounded annually for the next 15 years  the stock has a fair value of   145 share  a 50  premium to its current valuation of   98 share 
JNJ is not a get rich quick stock that will double within a year  but it is a safe investment with limited downside risk and significant upside potential  A safe investment like JNJ could benefit a lot of investors in such a risky market 
Look for JNJ to beat earnings expectations in the next couple of quarters as reported earnings catch up to economic earnings  Growth expectations are fairly muted  which gives significant opportunity for the stock to go up on positive results 
Also  further volatility like the market experienced last week could send investors running from risky  overvalued  momentum driven stocks and into steady dividend payers like JNJ  JNJ s fundamentals actually support a higher valuation  and I expect that quality is one that will become more attractive to investors no matter the market environment
