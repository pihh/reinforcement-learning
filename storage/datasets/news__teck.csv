187180,408696,TECK,Will Higher Volumes Aid Cleveland Cliffs   CLF  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Cleveland Cliffs Inc    NYSE CLF   is scheduled to release fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 8  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3  by posting adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents Consolidated revenues rose roughly 24 3  year over year to  741 8 million in the third quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  722 5 million Notably  Cleveland Cliffs beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters  with average positive surprise of 42  The stock has surged 54 9  in the past year  against the  s 4 4  decline Will the company surprise investors this time or is it heading for a possible pullback again  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Cleveland Cliffs is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter  That is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Cleveland Cliffs is  1 84   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at 58 cents and 57 cents  respectively  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Cleveland Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP  make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat  You can see Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors at Play in Q4In October 2018  Cleveland Cliffs stated that it expects to realize U S  Iron Ore revenue rates in the range of  105 to  110 per long ton  The projections assume that steel prices  pellet premiums and iron ore prices will be at their respective year to date averages for the rest of 2018 For 2018  Cleveland Cliffs maintained U S  Iron Ore sales and production volume expectations to 21 million long tons and 20 million tons  respectively  Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense expectation are unchanged at  58  63 per long ton The company has also provided an update on 2018 capital expenditure budget  The capital spending expectation for the Toledo HBI Project has been reduced by  25 million to  175 million due to further development and refined timing of the project spending plan   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues for Cleveland Cliffs for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at  714 million  reflecting an expected increase of around 18 8  year over year and a 3 8  decline sequentially U S  Iron Ore sales volumes are projected to increase 21  year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at 6 52 million long tons  The company is witnessing higher demand for pellets  Notably  sales volume jumped roughly 10  year over year in the last reported quarter mainly driven by increased customer demand Realized revenues per ton for the fourth quarter is projected to increase 22 9  year over year  as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  102  In the last reported quarter  revenues per ton improved 17  year over year  The upside was primarily driven by higher steel pricing and pellet premiums  resulting from favorable contract structures  However  the increase was partly offset by higher freight rates Moreover  the company s results are likely to gain from debt reduction actions  It expects net debt to be below  1 billion by the end of 2018  Efforts to lower debt will reduce the company s annualized interest expenses   Cleveland Cliffs Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other companies in the same space you may want to consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter New Gold Inc   NYSE NGD   has

187183,408699,TECK,4 Mining Stocks Poised To Outshine Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"The mining industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  Earnings growth for the Basic Materials sector in Q3 was second only to the energy sector  Overall earnings for the sector climbed 42  while revenues spiked 16 5  However  the earnings picture for Q4 looks lackluster  The Basic Materials sector is expected to lose momentum in Q4 as earnings for the sector are projected to decline 1 4  on 2 2  higher revenues  per the latest   In fact  the sector is among the four Zacks sectors that are expected to see lower year over year earnings in Q4 The mining industry had a turbulent 2018  weighed down by a slump in metals prices  Metal prices remained subdued last year due to the trade tussle between the United States and China  Further  concerns over a possible slowdown in China  the biggest metal consumer  also weighed on prices Gold and silver prices dropped in 2018 primarily owing to global trade tensions and a stronger dollar  The trade friction between the United States and China compelled investors to dump emerging market currencies and seek safe haven in dollar  Upbeat U S  economic data also caused the greenback to rally  Notably  a stronger dollar makes dollar priced gold costlier for non U S  investors  Another factor that worked against the precious metals last year is the U S  Federal Reserve s interest rate hikes  Higher U S  rates normally weigh on gold and silver Nevertheless  prices of precious metals have gained some lost ground of late  In particular  gold prices have broken above the psychologically important  1 300 an ounce threshold  Prices have found support from the Federal Reserve s dovish turn  geopolitical worries and global growth concerns  The Fed left interest rates unchanged at its recently concluded meeting and pledged to adopt a measured approach to further rate hikes considering the prevailing economic situation Meanwhile  the gold mining industry is currently witnessing a consolidation wave  The big players in this space are taking the consolidation route to boost their production as well as growth profile amid weakness in prices and depleting gold reserves  The recently completed merger of Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE GOLD   and Randgold Resources  LON RRS   and the proposed  10 billion mega merger between Newmont Mining Corporation   NYSE NEM   and Goldcorp Inc    NYSE GG   bear huge testimony to these strategic moves The gold mining industry is facing serious supply problems  Gold production is likely to drop eventually  as new discoveries remain scarce  existing resources are dwindling and grades are declining  These factors will likely compel more miners to resort to adding reserves through acquisitions than digging for new ones which are inherently risky and capital intensive  With risks of dwindling supply looming large on the gold mining industry  there is a likelihood of more mergers and acquisitions in the space Copper also had a rough 2018 with prices of the red metal falling around 20  for the year  also down by double digits in Q4   Prices of this major industrial metal slumped to their lowest level in more than a year in December amid concerns over demand for the metal due to U S  China trade tensions and a weakening Chinese economy  Tepid economic data from China   the world s biggest consumer of copper   has raised concerns of potential weaker demand for the commodity  However  copper prices got a boost recently from the Federal Reserve s dovish shift Amid a challenging environment  miners remain focused to whittle down operational costs and capital spending  improve operating efficiency within existing mines  pay down debt  eliminate non core assets and concentrate on their highest ore grade assets  Some of these companies have also taken steps to bring down their all in sustaining costs   the most important cost metric of miners  These actions are expected to support their margins in Q4  However  lower metal prices and weak productions will likely be a drag for miners How to Pick the Winners Given the large number of players operating in the mining space  picking the right stocks is apparently not an easy task  But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple  One can trim down the list with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive Zacks   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they report with our  Earnings ESP   the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate   is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have high chances of delivering earnings surprises in their next announcements  Our

187235,408751,TECK,Teck Resources Stock Gains Set To Stall In The Near Term  ,opinion,"Teck Resources Limited trades at higher EV EBITDA multiples compared to its peers  which should make investors cautious
Teck Resources Ltd B  NYSE TECK   Canada s largest diversified mining company and the world s second largest seaborne exporter of steelmaking coal  has seen its stock price surge nearly 39  over the past year on strong financial performance driven primarily by increased prices of commodities  particularly steelmaking coal  While the outlook for copper remains fairly optimistic  a muted outlook for the Company s major revenue and profitability contributor  steelmaking coal  could negatively impact its financial results over the coming quarters  Teck Resources also trades at higher EV EBITDA multiples compared to its peers  which should make investors cautious 

Investment Thesis

Canada s largest diversified resource company with significant presence in steelmaking coal  copper  and zinc
Strong results over the past few quarters on rising commodity prices
Steelmaking coal prices have stabilized in recent months with muted outlook on slowing China demand and ironing of supply concerns
Trades at a higher EV EBITA multiples compared to peers

Canada s largest diversified resource company 
Teck Resources is the largest diversified resource company  with a significant presence in steelmaking coal  copper  and zinc businesses across North America and South America  The Company has expertise in exploration  development  mining and minerals processing  including smelting and refining  safety  environmental protection  materials stewardship  recycling and research 
Teck Resources is the second largest seaborne exporter of steelmaking coal  a major producer of copper in the Americas  and the world s third largest producer of mined zinc  Teck Resources is also building its energy business with the development of Canadian oil sands mining projects 
Production of Company s Principal Products

First oil at Fort Hills by end 2017
The Fort Hills oil sands project is 92  complete and is on track to produce its first oil in late 2017  The commencement of oil operations further diversifies its business  thereby limiting risks associated with focused operations 
Steel making coal stabilizes after sharp run
After more than doubling over the past year on higher demand from China and supply disruptions in Australia  prices of steelmaking coal  the Company s key revenue contributor  57  of revenues in 2Q16   have stabilized in recent months  As China slows down and supply issues are sorted out  the outlook for steelmaking coal remains cautious  Production ramp up by major players  such as BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd   in recent months could also put pressure on coking coal prices in the near future  From US 300 per tonne in mid April after Cyclone Debbie disrupted key Australian supplies  prices of coking coal are now trading at  US 170 per tonne  Any further fall in prices could negatively impact the financial results of Teck Resources for 2017 and beyond 

Strong financial performance on rising commodity prices
Riding on the strong recovery in coal and metal prices  Teck Resources continues to report a stellar financial performance  For 2Q17  Teck Resources reported a 62  jump in revenues over the prior year quarter on increased production across most of its products  especially steelmaking coal supported by strong increases in prices  While steelmaking coal production rose to a second quarter record of 6 8 million tonnes  up from 6 1 mt in 1Q17 and 6 7 mt in 2Q16   realized prices doubled YoY to US 169 per tonne  Realized prices for copper  zinc and lead also rose between 20  30  during the quarter  Owing to the above mentioned factors  profit attributable to shareholders shot up to reach  577 million  or  1 00 per share  from just  15 million  or  0 03 per share  in the prior year quarter 

Cash flow from operations increased significantly to  1 4 billion from  339 million a year ago  which enabled Teck Resources to declare a dividend of  0 10 per share  compared to  0 03 in the prior year quarter 
Continued debt reduction
Teck Resources has reduced its debt by over US 2 4 billion over the past five years and as of June 30  2017  the Company s debt stands at a manageable US 4 8 billion  within its target of  US 5 0 billion  Teck Resources has an undrawn credit facility of US 3 0 billion  which is sufficient to fund its capex programs at the Fort Hills oil sands project and for other working capital purposes 

Valuation and Outlook
Although Teck Resources has reported strong results over the past few quarters on a recovery in commodity prices  especially steelmaking coal  its share price seems to have run ahead of fundamentals in the short term  A subdued outlook for steelmaking coal and other metals  after a sharp recovery  could result in a muted financial performance for the Company in the coming quarters 
High valuation is also evident in the high EV EBITDA multiple of 16 6x for Teck Resources compared to large diversified miners  such as BHP  NYSE BHP   Anglo American  LON AAL  Plc  and Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   which are trading between 10 0x 14 0x

187242,408758,TECK,Mining Stocks Earnings Lineup For Oct 26  NEM  TECK  AUY  EGO,opinion,The third quarter earnings season has gathered steam with 87 members of the S P 500 Index having reported their quarterly numbers  which make up 24 7  of the Index s total market capitalization  Per the latest status as of Oct 20  these companies have put a 9 4  increase in earnings on the back of 7 3  higher sales on the scoreboard  Around 71 3  of these companies delivered positive earnings surprises while 70 1  surpassed revenue expectations   Read more   Taking into account all the S P members that are yet to disclose their numbers  total earnings for the index are expected to be up 2 6  year over year on a 5  increase in revenues in the third quarter  Though this is a deceleration from an 11 2  increase in earnings in the second quarter and 13 6  in the first  growth graph will pick up from the fourth quarter onwards  Per projections  earnings growth will be 9 3  in fourth quarter 2017  9 3  in first quarter 2018  9 1  in the second and 12 6  in third quarter 2018 The  sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  is expected to log decline of 9 3  in third quarter earnings while revenues will rise 9 1   The mining stocks fall under the Basic Material sector Gold gained 5  in the third quarter  Gains from a weaker US dollar and geopolitical tensions between the United States and North Korea were the main highlights  The Fed also drove gold prices during the quarter  Copper has also been on a high as supply disruptions at some of the key copper mines including BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited s   NYSE BHP   Escondida mine  the world s biggest copper mine  in Chile earlier this year and a strike at Freeport McMoRan s Grasberg operations in Indonesia led to a decline in mined copper production and provided a thrust to prices Further  reports of a potential Chinese ban on certain imports of copper scrap by the end of 2018 as part of the country s move to reduce waste helped prop prices  This would lead to higher demand for refined copper and copper concentrate  While China s imports of copper scrap improved this year  the country s demand for refined copper remains depressed  As such  a ban on scrap would result in increased imports of refined copper  In fact  the non ferrous metal is among the best performing commodities this year In this write up  we take a sneak peek

187265,408781,TECK,This Not So Precious Metal Could Make You Precious Returns,opinion," Zinc doesn t usually grab a lot of headlines   I remarked late last year   but it might start grabbing a few in 2017  

The conditions continue to fall into place for a big rally in this overlooked metal  That s why I believe zinc will be one of the hot commodities of this year 
As this week s chart shows  zinc inventories at the London Metal Exchange  LME  have dropped to their lowest level since 2009  And as this chart also shows  periods of falling inventories tend to coincide with periods of rising zinc prices 
That s not surprising  It s common for a commodity s price to rise whenever supplies of that commodity become relatively scarce  For example  when LME zinc inventories dropped sharply between 2004 and 2006  the zinc price quadrupled from  0 50 a pound to  2 a pound 
If zinc inventories continue sliding lower  the price will awaken from its slumber and make a move higher 
And today  falling inventories aren t merely a possibility  they are the path of least resistance  That s because the mine supply of zinc is trailing behind demand  And this  supply deficit  is likely to persist for several more years 
That deficit isn t the result of just meager mine supplies  It s also the result of robust demand 
Most of us pay zero attention to zinc  but the stuff is an essential aspect of our day to day lives  It is the world s fourth most used metal  behind iron  aluminum and copper 
Zinc combines with certain metals to make a wide variety of alloys  But its primary industrial use is to galvanize steel  Because of this connection with steel  zinc demand tracks global economic growth very closely  especially the construction intensive economic growth that occurs in China 
In a TV interview late last year  Don Lindsay  the CEO of zinc major Teck Resources Ltd B  NYSE TECK   declared   We actually think the most exciting commodity is zinc because it has already gone through its bottoming process and is in a distinct  supply  deficit     So  we think zinc is just on the verge of  a  big move  
Lindsay believes the falling LME inventories  combined with falling mine production of zinc  will create a  pinch point sometime between now and six months from now   At that point  he says   We ll see quite a move  
How big could  quite a move  be  Here s some food for thought   
If the zinc price regained its 2006 high of  2 11 per pound  that would be a gain of 79  from the current quote of  1 18 per pound 
Keep your eyes on zinc  This dull industrial metal may soon begin shining more brightly than gold or silver ",2017-06-04,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-not-so-precious-metal-could-make-you-precious-returns-200193025,200193025
187266,408782,TECK,Is Teck Resources  TECK  A Suitable Value Pick Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Teck Resources Limited   NYSE TECK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Teck Resources has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 21  This level compares significantly favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 34 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock  the current level puts Teck Resources  current PE among its lowest territory over the observed period  This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its own historical levels and thus it could prove to be an extremely suitable entry point from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE also compares considerably favorably with the Zacks classified Mining   Miscellaneous industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 38 85  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Teck Resources has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 5 04   lower than the current figure  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Teck Resources stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Teck Resources has a P S ratio of about 1 20  This is lower than the Zacks categorized Mining   Miscellaneous industry average  which comes in at 6 75 right now If anything  TECK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Teck Resources currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Teck Resources a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Teck Resources is just 0 58  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 45  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 3 17  while the industry s average stands at a negative 1 79  Thus  while the industry is experiencing negative cash flows  TECK s financial health seems much better  Clearly  TECK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Teck Resources might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives TECK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  Teck Resources seems to have pretty striking prospects However  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards lately  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 12 9   while the full year estimate has moved down nearly 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Teck Resources Ltd Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTeck Resources is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 14  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Mining   Miscellaneous industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-06-27,Zacks Investment

187269,408785,TECK,Why Earnings Season Could Be Great For Teck Resources  TECK 	,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Teck Resources Ltd   NYSE TECK   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Teck Resources is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TECK in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 72 cents per share for TECK  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TECK  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  2 86  heading into earnings season Teck Resources Ltd Price and EPS Surprise    Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that TECK has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Teck Resources  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaries    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2017-07-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-earnings-season-could-be-great-for-teck-resources-(teck)-200203602,200203602

187310,408826,TECK,Project Generator Millrock Resources Options Alaska Copper Gold Property,opinion,"It s been a busy week for Millrock Resources Inc  TO MRO  
On Monday the project generator expanded its portfolio with a foray into B C  s Golden Triangle  It capped the week off today by optioning one of its Alaska properties 
Under the terms of the agreement  Vista Minerals   a private Australian group   can earn an 80  joint venture interest in Millrock s Stellar property by making exploration expenditures of US 4 million and cash payments totaling US 300 000  Millrock will retain a 1  Net Smelter Royalty on all metals  The claims are also subject to a royalty in favour of Altius Minerals Corporation  TO ALS   In the event that a joint venture partner is diluted below a 10  equity interest  such interest will convert to a 1  NSR 
 We are pleased to make this agreement and are looking forward to seeing this great exploration project advance   said Millrock President   CEO Gregory Beischer   Vista appears to have a strong technical team and we wish them great success with future drilling programs  
The Stellar project is located in central Alaska 13 km north of the Denali Highway and 68 km west of the town of Paxson  Alaska  The property  which Millrock acquired by staking in 2012  covers the Zackly copper gold skarn deposit  Surrounding lands are considered prospective for porphyry copper gold deposits  or other types of copper deposits and intrusion related gold deposits  Millrock owns a 100  interest in the claims  Since acquiring the claims the company has done geochemical and geophysical surveys to develop drill targets 
Millrock s move into the Golden Triangle involved the acquisition of three properties   two of them adjacent to Pretium s Brucejack project in the historic gold producing mountains of northwestern B C 
The 20 276 hectare Todd Creek property had a historical and non NI 43101 compliant resource of 207 000 tons grading 5 85 g t Au  Hemlo Gold Mines 1998 Annual Report   Todd Creek is adjacent to Pretivm Resources  southeast boundary  There s been not much modern exploration on the property  Exploration permits are in place for 2016 
The 32 000 hectare Oweegee Dome project is adjacent to Pretivm Resources  Brucejack project and adjacent to the east of Seabridge Gold Inc s  TO SEA  KSM project  two of the richest development stage gold projects  There are numerous untested targets at Oweegee Dome  according to Millrock 
The newly consolidated and 7 300 hectares Poly property has numerous untested targets  many revealed by rapid glacial melting  Poly s exploration permits are also in place for 2016 
Pretium continues to build its high grade underground gold mine and earlier this week released drill results from a grassroots regional exploration program 
The company hit long intervals of low grade gold mineralization to the south and southeast of Valley of the Kings as well as zones of polymetallic mineralization 
In a terrible market for financings and junior exploration companies  the Golden Triangle has been a hotbed of exploration activity 
It was a busy year for Skeena Resources Limited  TO SKE   which recently acquired the GJ property adjoining its high grade Spectrum project  Skeena drilled 17 350 metres in 61 drill holes during its 2015 drilling campaign  as well as collecting soil and rock samples 
Highlights from the most recent results included 18 metres grading 6 13 g t gold and 18m at 2 69 g t  The drilling will add ounces to a maiden NI 43 101 compliant resource estimate at Spectrum  expected in the first quarter of 2016  as well as help the company select drill targets for 2016 
Skeena also plans to release an updated resource estimate for the GJ property  which it bought from partners Teck Resources Ltd  TO TCKb   51   and NGEx Resources Inc  TO NGQ   GJ consists of 80 mineral claims totalling 37 508 hectares and includes both high grade gold and silver occurrences in veins and a copper gold porphyry ",2015-12-20,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/project-generator-millrock-resources-options-alaska-copper-gold-property-376447,376447

187339,408855,TECK,Copper  Nickel and Zinc Won t Be Cheap for Long,opinion,"The all powerful US Dollar Index is currently hammering base metals and base metal equities  Haywood Securities Mining Analyst Stefan Ioannou says that increasing demand and near term supply shortages make base metals a bargain that won t last  In this interview with   Ioannou argues that juniors with good deposits and low costs are in a unique position to benefit  and lists several companies that look to do just that 
The Mining Report  What effect is the strong U S  dollar having on base metal prices and base metal equities 
Stefan Ioannou  Base metals are priced in U S  dollars  so as the dollar rises in value  base metals fall in value  Right now  copper is testing the  3 per pound   3 lb  level  and Zinc is drifting down toward  1 lb  And  of course  lower base metal prices are reflected in lower valuations of base metal equities 
TMR  Why is the US Dollar becoming stronger 
SI  Because of a strengthening U S  economy or at least the perception of one  To give one example  the job creation figure for September was expected to be 215 000  but the number came in at 248 000 
TMR  How long will this U S  dollar trend last 

SI  With quantitative easing seemingly over  which is still arguable  the big question for the U S  economy is when and by how much will interest rates be increased  Elsewhere in the world  the other major economies seem to be  if not slipping  not really growing significantly  Europe is kind of flat  China is still growing but not nearly as fast as people had hoped for or expected  As a result  most world currencies are down relative to the U S  dollar 
TMR  What are your forecasts for base metal prices 
SI  Our metal price forecasts for 2015 forward include  3 25 lb copper   8 50 lb nickel and  1 15 lb zinc 
TMR  What are the economic assumptions underlying these forecasts 
SI  We try to pick metal prices that are arguably conservative  but we do take into account some of the major supply demand fundamentals coming down the pipe  For example  zinc is facing a significant supply deficit into 2016  so we could see zinc rise above  1 50 lb fairly quickly  Would it stay there for more than two or three years  Probably not  given the anticipated increase in higher cost Chinese production that higher zinc prices would trigger  Nevertheless  we see a medium term investment opportunity emerging 
TMR  Given how important China is to world economic growth  how much do we really know about the Chinese economy 
SI  China has always been a bit of a mystery  The September Purchasing Managers Index  PMI  number was the same as August  51 1  Anything over 50 indicates expanding growth  but it is subdued growth  The market has been looking to 7 5  GDP growth in China this year  but it looks as if it won t make that 
The worrisome aspects to the Chinese economy are an ailing property market  industrial overcapacity and high levels of corporate debt  Housing is about 25  of the Chinese economy  so policymakers are now considering loosening mortgage restrictions 
TMR  Why do you believe the world faces a copper deficit in the near future 

SI  On the supply side  the majors have in the last few years focused on cutting costs at existing operations  That s obviously great for their bottom lines today  However  it also means new mines and greenfield developments are being deferred  So by 2017 2018 we will face the consequence of a lack of new supply  which is demand outweighing supply 
TMR  Does the world face a near term nickel deficit as well 
SI  A big driver for nickel is the steel market  and this has been relatively bearish  This year  however  Indonesia  which provides 25  of world supply  banned the export of nickel ore  Indonesia wants the economic benefits of processing its ore in country  but it will take a couple of years to build its infrastructure so that this lost supply will re enter the global market 
The Philippines is also now considering an export ban of its own  This country supplies less than 10  of the world market  but it s still a significant number  Nickel ore stockpiles in China and elsewhere are still high  but are now being drawn down toward potentially critical levels  There is a bullish argument that we could see the nickel market slip into deficit by as early as mid 2015 
TMR  What s your view of the junior copper space 
SI  Everything I cover has come down in valuation  I think there is opportunity here  The best place to start is with the producers because they are generating cash flow and have positive balance sheets  One such company is Copper Mountain Mining Corporation  TO CUM    Its Copper Mountain mine in British Columbia owned 25  by Mitsubishi Corp  OTC MSBHY    8058 JP  has had a long start up  The company has just installed a new secondary crusher  which is finally going to bring it to nameplate capacity  35 000 tonnes per day  35 Kt day  of throughput  This is the turning point  and I think Copper Mountain Mining is poised for a rerating 
TMR  You just raised your target price  correct 
SI  Yes  from  3 to  3 50  We just saw the company s Q3 14 production numbers  The crusher integration went smoothly over the latter half of the period and was handling over 35 Kt day in late September  which should set the stage for a strong Q4 14 
TMR  What other producers did you want to discuss 
SI  Capstone Mining Corp   TO CS  and Nevsun Resources Ltd   TO NSU   Capstone has three mines which  for the most part  are operating well  Pinto Valley in Arizona  Cozamin in Mexico and Minto in the Yukon  Pinto Valley was bought from BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP   last year for  650 million   650M   The market was skeptical at the time  but the company immediately drilled and expanded the project s five year reserve  which now supports a mine plan through 2026  This has been a game changer for Capstone s capacity 

TMR  As a result  you wrote in August that Minto s position as a  core asset  has been diminished 
SI  Minto has been a very successful mine over the years  But it s getting to the point now where the remaining resource is for the most part lower grade and higher cost to produce  Cozamin  Capstone s third mine  is also smaller than Pinto Valley  but it s got very good grade and a lot of exploration potential  It s an underground mine  so Capstone is going to continue to add reserves over time  Plus  there s a fair bit of zinc coming out of it 
TMR  Is Nevsun an example of the perils of overstating political risk  The Bisha mine is in Eritrea  but it is nonetheless a success story  right 
SI  Very much so  I give the Eritrean government a lot of credit  It established a well defined and well considered mining code that lays out exactly how the government will participate and the steps that need to be taken to move a project into production  Bisha is now 60  owned by Nevsun and 40  by the government  The government got 10  for free  which is pretty standard across Africa  and proceeded to pay fair value for the other 30  
Nevsun has close to  400M in cash and no debt  That works out to  2 share  and so half of the company s share price is actually cash  Nevsun s biggest issue going forward is what its next acquisition is going to be 
TMR  Bisha began with gold mining and then with copper  What is its future 
SI  Bisha is a 40 million ton  40 Mt  volcanogenic massive sulfide  VMS  deposit  world class in size and high grade  For the first few years Nevsun mined 8 grams per ton  8 g t  Gold from an open pit that had basically no strip ratio to it  Now the company is into the second layer of the VMS cake  supergene copper  It is mining grades well north of 5  now in an open pit  As Nevsun moves into the third layer  toward 2016  there will be zinc and copper  hopefully just as the zinc price really starts to pick up 
TMR  What are the prospects for resource growth at Bisha 
SI  Bisha has always been a very prospective land package  but this is the first year Nevsun has spent significant money on regional exploration  VMS deposits typically occur in clusters  and Nevsun has already found a few smaller ones outside Bisha  one called Harena is 10 kilometers south  Assays released September 23 included 0 85  copper  3 96  zinc  0 4 g t gold and 43 6 g t Silver over 41 6 meters  Nevsun has already outlined a 1 2 Mt reserve that remains open for expansion  Ore from the deposit will be trucked to the Bisha plant for processing 
TMR  Which copper project most interests you 
SI  Highland Copper Company Inc   TO HI  which is in Michigan s Upper Peninsula  an area with a really productive copper mining history  The company originally had two smaller  high grade deposits  543S and G2  Then in February  the company bought the Copperwood mine from Orvana Minerals Corp   TO ORV  for  25M  This is an advanced stage project  feasibility done  essentially permitted  ready to go  And then Highland bought the historic White Pine mine and surrounding property  The idea now is to consolidate those deposits and build a centralized facility  Highland could produce upward of 200 million pounds  200 Mlb  a year  a number that will attract the interest of midtier producers 
TMR  After consolidation  how much will this project cost 
SI  My ballpark number would be  650M for a 16 Kt day operation 
TMR  But Highland wouldn t be doing this on its own 
SI  It s going to be a 50 50 joint venture  JV  with AMCI Group  Highland s bringing the project to the table  and AMCI s bringing the money   45M by December 15  which is basically all the funding required to take the project through feasibility  which is expected by early 2016 
TMR  Which nickel project most interests you 
SI  Talon Metals Corp   TO TLO  and its Tamarack nickel copper platinum project in Minnesota  This is a JV with Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO    Talon has the option to spend  37M over the next three years to own 30   At that point Rio Tinto has a decision to make  If a resource gets defined to the point where it s big enough  Rio Tinto will build the mine as a 70 30 JV  Or if Rio Tinto decides it s not big enough  Talon can buy out Rio Tinto for  107M 
TMR  The company announced an initial resource estimate September 2 
SI  This is a high grade nickel sulfide deposit of about 6 Mt now  with more than 2  nickel equivalent  It s close to infrastructure  From a geological perspective  it s similar to Voisey s Bay  The deposit is shaped like a tadpole  The 6 Mt is located in the tail  which is wide open and could contain 10 20 Mt  The head  which hasn t been drilled  holds the real blue sky potential for a very large discovery  I think that s why Rio Tinto has kept an interest in it  Even if the deposit turns out not to be large enough for Rio Tinto  it s already looking as if it could be one heck of a deposit for a junior to midtier producer 
I should mention that Rio Tinto had another nickel deposit in the northern U S   Eagle  which it sold to Lundin Mining Corp   LUN TSX  last year for  325M  Eagle is going to be a mine  but Rio Tinto sold that one and kept Tamarack  That should tell you something 
TMR  Are there other projects similar to Voisey s Bay 
SI  North American Nickel Inc  TO NAN   s Maniitsoq project in Greenland has a similar type of geology  One of the things the market really likes to see in the nickel space is sulfide nickel projects  like Maniitsoq  instead of laterite nickel  Processing is just a lot simpler and good grades are common  Maniitsoq hit some very high grades right off the bat in 2013  It didn t get those barnburner grades this year  but I don t think this story is over 
North American Nickel is owned 30  by VMS Ventures Inc   whose primary asset is a VMS deposit in Manitoba called Reed  itself a JV with HudBay Minerals Inc   NYSE HBM   VMS Ventures is getting cash flow out of that  One way to play the Maniitsoq story is to buy VMS shares  Then you get cash flow  plus the potential benefits from Greenland 
TMR  What about other nickel sulfide projects 
SI  Balmoral Resources Ltd   TO BAR  has made a high grade nickel sulfide discovery at its Grasset project in Quebec  which has garnered a lot of attention  There is also Royal Nickel Corporation  TO RNX   Dumont project in Quebec  Production start up is targeted in 2016  On the one hand  it s low grade at  0 3  nickel  On the other  it contains billions of tonnes  which translates into a long mine life and a pretty significant production profile  The company s in the midst of permitting and shoring up project financing  which will likely entail a partnership 
TMR  According to Royal s website  this would be the fifth largest nickel sulfide operation in the world  When you add low grade to that  you re talking a big capital expenditure  capex  
SI   1 2B is the feasibility study number 
TMR  Is Dumont dependent on a rise in the price of nickel 
SI  Considering its capex  to generate an 18  internal rate of return  Dumont would probably require a nickel price of at least  9 00 lb  That said  the deposit s size underpins a mine plan that would span multiple metal price cycles 
TMR  Which zinc producer stands out 
SI  We believe that Trevali Mining Corp  OTC TREVF   is poised to become the marquee name in the zinc space  Zinc is facing a significant medium term supply issue because of mine closures  Last year  the Brunswick  12 mine in New Brunswick  an Xstrata Plc  OTC GLCNF  operation  was depleted  Soon  China Minmetals Corp  s Century mine in Australia and Vedanta Resources  LONDON VED  Lisheen mine in Ireland will close  too  Within the next two years  something on the order of 10 12  of world production will be lost 
The flip side is that there are no significant advanced stage projects in line to make up this deficit  Almost by default  anyone who has zinc in its name or has a zinc association is poised to do well  Trevali is the leader of that pack  It is in production now at Santander in Peru  about 40 Mlb a year currently  Caribou in New Brunswick is slated to begin commissioning in the second quarter of next year  When it is up and running at full scale capacity  it will add about 90 Mlb a year  Santander is scheduled for an expansion  probably in 2016 2017  to 80 Mlb  At the end of the day  we are looking at a zinc company with over 170 Mlb of annual zinc production on its books 
TMR  Which other North American zinc projects interest you 
SI  Foran Mining Corporation  TO FOM  s  McIlvenna Bay project began its preliminary economic assessment last month  It s a VMS deposit with zinc  copper and other metals  It s in Saskatchewan  just over the border from Manitoba  Geologically  it s within the Flin Flon Greenstone Belt and at 25 Mt is the third biggest discovery in the world class mining camp  It has proximity to HudBay s infrastructure  and it could be strategic to HudBay at some point in the future 
TMR  HudBay s share price rose from  8 in the spring to about  11 50 and then fell to  9 25  Was its takeover of Augusta Resource Corp  and its Rosemont copper project in Arizona a mistake 
SI  I would argue that it was a pretty strategic move for HudBay  The company put in an early bid  before Rosemont s permitting was completed  It took a chance  but got Rosemont at a discounted valuation  HudBay already has its development plate full with Lalor in Manitoba and probably even more so with Constancia in Peru  So it is taking a longer term view on Rosemont s development timeline relative to the project s previous owner 
TMR  HudBay completed a  170M debt financing in August  How do you rate its expansion versus its bottom line 
SI  Well  HudBay has to be careful  The company is currently spending a lot of money to grow its production profile at multiple operations  Constancia is a  1 7B project  But the good news is that we were down at the site in September  and it is tracking on schedule and on budget  It s 92  complete as we speak 
TMR  What about any projects in Alaska 
SI  There is Zazu Metals Corporation  TO ZAZ   s LIK project  It has silver  as well as zinc  And some lead  as well  but zinc is its main focus  LIK is very close to Teck Resources Ltd  NYSE TCK  s Red Dog zinc mine  the world s largest  with about 5  of world production 
TMR  LIK is a JV with Teck  is it not 
SI  Yes  but it s slightly different than your typical junior major JV  In this case  Zazu is spending  18M to own 80  and Teck will not have a subsequent back in right 
TMR  What do you think of the project 
SI  There s very good established infrastructure  and just across the project boundary Teck has a deposit called Su  The area is basically one big deposit  If and when Teck puts Su into production  it would make almost no sense to do it without a combined Su LIK open pit  Furthermore  Red Dog is very high grade  but it s also underpinned by an onerous royalty structure with a First Nations company called NANA Regional Corp  Eventually  NANA will get a 50  net proceeds interest  NPI  royalty from Red Dog  LIK and Su have lower grades  but there NANA does not hold an NPI royalty on potential production from the deposits 
The other consideration is that two years ago Zebra Holdings  which is the Lundin family s affiliated trust  bought 20  of Zazu  arguably bringing Lundin Mining into the picture  And we expect that with the zinc price rising  established producers are going to be looking for assets 
TMR  It has been said that the low hanging fruit in base metals has all been picked  Thus  future projects will be more difficult and expensive  so people are just going to have to get used to permanently higher base metals prices  Do you agree 
SI  As the majors have gotten bigger  the size of the deposits they require to actually make a difference to their bottom lines needs to be bigger  Unfortunately  grade and tonnage are inversely proportional  Generally speaking  big deposits are going to be low grade  And so costs will be higher  Right now  the middle of the cost curve for copper is on the order of  1 50 1 75 lb  As we mine more and more lower grade deposits  I wouldn t be surprised if that position on the cost curve reached  2 lb 
TMR  Doesn t this suggest a particular opportunity for what we might call high grade boutique projects 
SI  For sure  At the end of the day grade is king  I think it always will be  If you can find something that has a reasonable tonnage and a good grade  you could be off to the races  Such projects can be company makers  For instance  Talon has the potential to mine a modest sized nickel deposit with very good grade  Again  probably not big enough for Rio Tinto but very lucrative for Talon  That s where the opportunity lies for some of these smaller companies

187340,408856,TECK,Zinc  Stealth Bull Market Coming,opinion,"Commodity investors are always looking for the next bull market but are understandably wary of jumping on the wagon too soon   especially given the pain of the last couple of years 
China s economic growth is slowing  its stock market seems to be melting down  and most metals have been dragged down significantly over the last several weeks 
But an oft overlooked metal may be on the cusp of a bull market 
I attended the Sprott Stansberry Natural Resource Symposium in Vancouver in July  and was particularly interested in hearing legendary resource investor Rick Rule discuss the current state of the markets 
Bull markets in commodities can be created in two different ways  Mr  Rule reminded investors 
1  Demand creation   when economies grow  demand for metals increases  A good example of this has been China s rapid growth over the past 15 years 
2  Supply destruction   commodity prices below the cost of production can lead to mine closures  These closures result in less available metal for consumption 
To summarize  as the demand becomes greater than the supply  the price of the commodity rises 
Following Mr  Rule s presentation  I began to research metals with fundamentals that could lead to a bull market 
After much study  I have concluded that this metal is zinc 
The upcoming zinc market seems to be setting up for a bull market  on both the supply and demand side  Zinc demand is currently growing at 3 4  per year  In terms of supply destruction  zinc has a unique twist  Mines are closing down not because they are unprofitable  but because they are being depleted 
In fact  the world s third largest zinc mine  MMG s Century mine in Australia  ceased mining operations at the end of July 2015  Stockpiles of ore will continue to be processed through the end of the year  Century produced 465 696 tonnes in 2014  about 3 6  of the world s global supply of 13 million tonnes 
 We can t find any more zinc of significance  which tells us even more that it s going to be tight   MMG CEO Andrew Michelmore said in March 2015   We re very bullish on zinc    source Bloomberg Television 
The Lisheen mine in Ireland is also expected to close in November  removing an additional 150 000 tonnes  1  of supply  from the market 
With these two closures alone removing more than 4 5  of global production  2016 is shaping up to be a strong year for the zinc price  During the last zinc bull market  from 2005 to 2007  its price rose an astounding 179  
Investors searching for the next hot commodity should definitely consider zinc 
Zinc s recent past and its future
Very few companies have been focused on zinc in the past several years  meaning there has been almost no zinc exploration and very little development of zinc projects 
In the face of projected zinc supply deficits  the metal recently hit a five year low  dipping below 80 cents as investors worried about slowing growth in China  In a July research note  the Bank of Montreal projected that demand could slow from the current 3 4  yearly growth  Economic growth is currently similar to levels seen in the 1990s when  annual zinc demand growth averaged only 2 5    BMO stated 
Even if zinc demand only averages a 2  increase for the next of couple years  that s a significant spread from a 4 5  drop in supply 
Simply put  inventories will start to decline and the price of zinc should rise unless supply picks up  To pick up the slack from the closures of Century and Lisheen alone  the market will need to find an additional 615 000 tonnes 

No new major zinc mines are scheduled to open in the next few years  and very little is in the pipeline  leading us to believe there will be a very large supply gap  Scotiabank  LM SCO  economist Patricia Mohr s research has shown that a zinc price of  1 13 USD is needed to spur new mine development 
China is a wild card when it comes to zinc production  but analysts question whether China might be able to fill the void itself 
In a recent interview with Investing News Network  newsletter writer and analyst John Kaiser said he believes Chinese zinc supply  has peaked  and  may even decline  
 That is not what s being factored into people s expectations for stronger zinc prices  which is based on a depletion of several western mines with no western mines coming on stream to replace that supply   Kaiser commented 
A company to keep an eye on  Canada Zinc Metals  TO CZX 
My research also involved examining every zinc focused exploration and development company listed on Canadian markets 
One of the companies with the most leverage to zinc is Canada Zinc Metals  CZX TSXV  
Canada Zinc Metals has several advantages over its peers  as many of them are challenged by one or more of the following issues  permitting  infrastructure problems  high capex  low grade deposits  or stressed balance sheets 
Canada Zinc Metals has an indicated resource of 12 7 million tonnes containing 2 35 billion pounds of zinc  8 38  grade   470 million pounds of lead  1 68  grade   and 5 6 million ounces of silver  13 7 g t   An additional inferred resource of 16 3 million tonnes adds 2 65 billion pounds of zinc  7 38  grade   480 million pounds of lead  1 34  grade   and 6 million pounds of silver 
The stock is currently trading at a market cap of  32 million and has about  8 million in the bank  for an enterprise value of  24 million 
A quick calculation results in an enterprise value per pound of zinc of  0 0048 cents per pound   among the lowest in the peer group 
Canada Zinc Metals  resource estimate is based on drilling data inclusive to 2011  Since then the company has systematically drilled holes that have expanded the deposit down dip as well as confirming the continuity of the overall resource and high grade nature of the deposit 
The 2015 eight hole summer program is currently in progress  On Sept  2  Canada Zinc Metals released one of the highest grade drill results ever on hole A 15 121 
Drill hole A 15 121 targeted the high grade core of the Cardiac Creek deposit with the intended pierce point located approximately 75 metres down dip of the high grade holes A 05 32  A 07 50 and A 07 53  The entire mineralized interval extending from 419 16 to 531 00 metres returned 7 34 per cent combined Zn Pb and 14 24 g t Ag over a true width of 64 29 metres  Included in this interval was 17 06  Zn Pb over 12 98 metres 
Peeyush Varshney  Chairman and CEO of Canada Zinc Metals  stated   The results from hole A 15 121 continue to expand the known high grade mineralization within the core of the deposit by approximately 70 metres down dip of the current limits  
Canada Zinc Metals already has one of the highest grade undeveloped zinc projects in the world 

Producing zinc mines are seeing declines in average head grades   they have declined from about 7  in the year 2000 to about 5 5  now  Canada Zinc Metals deposit  with an average grade of close to 8   is well above the global average grade of 5 5  being mined 
Having a high grade project has tremendous advantages   namely  higher profits if the mine goes into production and an increase in the likelihood of a takeover from another mining company 
Canada Zinc Metals  shareholder base is among the strongest of any publicly traded junior company and includes Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group  SZ 000630   Lundin Mining  TO LUN   Teck Resources  NYSE TCK  and Korea Zinc  KS 010130  
Management feels the stock is undervalued at current prices and has arranged for a share buyback program of up to 7 620 721 shares 

Share price catalysts 
Upcoming drill assays on the final six holes of the 2015 exploration program  which is expected to wrap up in the third week of September  Current plans include the release of two holes at a time as assays come in  which will result in steady news flow throughout year s end 
The fundamentals for a zinc price increase are robust  As zinc enters a supply demand deficit we will see inventories drawn down 
In essence  investors early to the zinc game could be rewarded 
The name of the game is to buy low and sell high  and 2016 could be the year we see zinc reach a tipping point 
Add Canada Zinc Metals to your radar as a call option on zinc  CZX on the TSXV

187341,408857,TECK,Skeena Resources  Gold Junior Buying Assets  Aggressively Drilling,opinion,"Skeena Resources Limited  TO SKE    the Company   announced the acquisition of 100  of the GJ Property   GJ  from majority owner Teck Resources Ltd  NYSE TCK  and 49  partner  NGEx Resources Inc  TO NGQ   Skeena Resources picked up GJ for a song  These days  when no one wants to  and can t afford to anyway  explore  drill  develop or buy assets  Skeena is on the hunt  Recall that the Company recently relinquished an acquisition attempt of Dolly Varden Silver Corporation  TO DV  when CEO  Walter Coles and team couldn t get it at a rock bargain price  my opinion only   The deal  is important in a number of ways 
   A low cost  long term call option on the price of copper 
   Diversification into a 2nd prospective opportunity  adjacent to the east of Skeena s 
   Substantially more property  GJ roughly 10x the size of Spectrum  and the flexibility to use it in synergistic ways 
   Diversification into a 2nd commodity  copper  No longer solely a gold play 
   GJ includes the Donnelly   North Donnelly  porphyry copper gold deposits  with a historic Measured   Indicated resource of 1 1 billion lbs copper   1 8 million ozs gold  according to a NI 43 101 technical report from 2007   Note  this data needs to be updated  M I figures are not currently NI 43 101 compliant    Note  the yet to be re submitted  no longer complaint resource  is contained in well under 5  of the entire land package  
   More than  30 million in exploration work done at GJ by various operators since the mid 1960s  including nearly  25 million spent by Teck   NGEx alone between 2000 and 2014  In today s dollars I image that  30 million would be considerably higher 
Can anyone throw cold water on any of my six claimed benefits  In my opinion  this is very good news  an attractive acquisition  with strong optionality  even before considering very appealing transaction terms  Red Flag  Why would Teck   NGXe abandon this property given that combined  they and predecessors had spent more than  30 million on GJ dating back to the mid 1960s  That includes nearly  25 million spent by Teck   NGEx alone between 2000 and 2014  Is it that since Teck and NGXe are under pressure to curtail cash outlays  lower debt  slow spending on their pipeline of assets and reduce headcount  Is this a vote of non confidence in DJ since Teck and NGXe sold it instead of another asset  NO  DJ was the definition of a non core asset  Neither Teck s nor NGXe s corporate websites or presentations made a single reference to GJ  Red Flag resolved 
Terms of deal with Teck Resources   NGEx ResourcesThis is one of the more important  and frankly awesome  aspects of the acquisition  Summarizing a bit   500 000 cash and  1 million worth of Skeena shares are required upon closing   1 5 million of Skeena shares  at the Company s timing and discretion  anytime within 2 years from closing   1 5 million of Skeena shares  at the Company s timing and discretion  anytime within 5 years from closing  A  4 million cash payment  anytime until 45 days prior to Commercial Production from the GJ Property  Finally  there s the fairly routine mechanism whereby GJ s main claim block would be subject to a 2  Net Smelter Return royalty   NSR   payable to Teck and NGEx 

Think this through with me  Skeena has up to 2 years after the closing to proceed  or walk away  Therefore  nothing more need ever be paid  no shares  no cash  no NSR  nothing  In  my opinion only   Skeena just bought the entire asset for  500k    1 mm worth of Skeena shares  This transaction is actually a lot better than the proposed term sheet lays out  Am I being overly bullish or dismissive of risks  I don t think so  In fact  Skeena is doing exactly what much larger companies do  the Majors often foist a deal like this on the juniors  One last thing before I move on to the October 8th   

Saving the best for last  Most often a non compliant NI 43 101 resource needs drilling to be done  such as twinning prior holes to demonstrate high correlation between old and new  In speaking with management  I learned that no additional drill holes need be drilled to prove up a  new  NI 43 101 compliant resource  This is simply because the old holes are only 8 years old  and new assays  from existing data  will be included  To be clear  this does not mean that the  new  NI 43 101 compliant resource will be any larger or higher grade  it should be about the same  1 8 million ozs gold and 1 1 billion lbs copper   non Ni 43 101 compliant at this time  
October 8th press release  more assays reported
Clearly  I m quite optimistic about Skeena Resources  acquisition  Now I turn to the most recent set of assays  First off  the Company reported one of its best holes ever  Quote from press release 

  at the south end of the deposit   Skeena  intersected three high grade intervals between 197 and 232 m  The most significant interval is 11 4 m grading 16 73 g t Au  including 2 0 m grading 81 8 g t Au  The other significant intervals included 4 m grading 24 24 g t Au including 2 m grading 44 8 g t Au  and 4 m grading 26 59 g t Au  including 2 m grading 46 5 g t Au  These high grade intervals in especially noteworthy because they are located 45 m south of hole SP 14 009 which cut several high grade sections  including 2 m grading 254 5 g t 

The press release continues with a review of assay results from northern portions of the Central Zone  A number of assays returned values that were disappointing  they   encountered only weak mineralization and it appears the zone may be pinching out to depth in this area  Strong gold in soil values to the north and east of the area indicate the mineralization could continue  but the mineralized trend may shift over to the Boundary and Road Zones   
Ron Netolitzky  Skeena s Chairman and 2nd largest shareholder commented 
 The high grade sections in hole S15 043 from the southern portion of the Central Zone are arguably our best yet and represent a step out to the south from hole SP14 009  The deposit appears open for resource expansion to the south  In the middle of the Central Zone  we have encountered broad intervals of near surface porphyry gold copper mineralization with deeper higher grade intervals consistent with the historic drilling results  At the north end of the Central Zone  we need to do more work to understand how the high grade gold zones are controlled  Our near term objective remains to establish a high grade gold resource by the end of Q1 2016 and these latest results take us another step towards achieving that goal  
I don t dare miss a quote from Mr  Netolitzky  as his sentiment is of vital importance to Skeena Resources as he leads the Company s technical team and drill target analysis efforts  Reading between the lines  some investors might be disappointed by the results on the northern portions  but each and every drill hole  good  very good  mediocre and bad  provides valuable information for future drilling  of which there will be plenty of  To date  59 drill holes have been punched  for a total of 16 500 meters this season 
Skeena is drilling the last two holes now  According to  Mike Cathro  M  Sc  P  Geo  VP Operations  All in that will be 61 drill holes   17 500 meters  As Mr Netolitzky  said the they   encountered broad intervals of near surface porphyry gold copper mineralization   The team has the winter to figure out what  if anything  to follow up with this not entirely surprising result  As far as I can tell  Skeena remains a High Grade story through and through  There are still a number of assays in the lab waiting to be reported  My understanding is that most of them are on the sexier southern portion  where of course some superb cores have been drilled  including roughly 25  with visible gold  All eyes on the next set of drill results  expected in the next several weeks

187366,408882,TECK,Strangulation By Regulation  Is Junior Mining Exchange On Its Deathbed ,opinion,Don Mosher  a business consultant with B D Capital in Vancouver is sounding the alarm  The TSX Venture Exchange  a once thriving exchange for junior mining companies  is struggling  Its strife is a symptom of the overregulation that is slowly killing a whole sector of the Canadian economy  forcing mining companies and their servicers out of business or to move overseas  But the death knell hasn t sounded yet  Mosher tells The Gold Report  He believes the Venture Exchange and mining in Canada can be saved and he outlines his plan here  The Gold Report  Don  you believe that Canada s TSX Venture Exchange  where most of the world s junior mining equities raise cash  is in crisis  Your concern stems from overregulation and market inefficiencies  Can you give us an example to illustrate your point  Don Mosher  Take a capital pool company or even a junior initial public offering  It might raise from  200 000   200K  to  1 million   1M   but about 40  of that goes to regulators  attorneys and accountants before it even gets a listing  The chances of success are very small when a company has to use that amount of capital right out of the gate  just to get a listing in place  TGR  If it s that prohibitive  why are there 1 673 junior mining companies listed on the TSX Venture  DM  Over the last 12 years  with the real rise in commodity prices  investors started to pour money back into a resource sector that had been in maintenance mode  The money started to come back in and  as a result  we ve got 1 600  listings  I promise you  it will be a different number in a year  and it certainly won t be going up  TGR  If the TSX Venture is in crisis  how do we know the patient is ill  DM  A strong indicator is that the exchange did away with the  0 05 minimum for financing  It allows companies to do  0 01 financings  What on earth can you raise at a penny  What s that going to do for the shareholders  The dilution on that is off the charts  TGR  We ve had downturns in this segment of the market before and it s always come back  What s different this time  DM  This time it isn t due to low commodity prices or demand  Instead  there are regulatory barriers to investors  and escalating costs  that startups simply can t afford  Also  other regulations are making things more difficult  There s a regulation coming into effect on March 26 that will force brokers to take a look at becoming asset gatherers  as opposed to speculating  With the regulations and liability being forced upon the brokers  I can foresee the extinction of the independent brokers Haywood Securities  PI Financial  Leede Financial  Jordan Capital Markets  Toll Cross Securities  Byron Capital Markets because they re not built to be asset gatherers  They re not built to be in competition with the big banks  The investors who do want to play the Venture market are going to get forced into the discount houses  where there is no expertise to encourage or help them  If these brokers can t reach out to retail  which has been killed off due to commission tampering and the piling on of regulations  they re left with the funds  Let s face it  There are only so many funds out there  Everybody s feeding out of the same trough and there s less and less to eat  TGR  Are you worried about crying wolf  DM  I hope I m completely wrong  but I ve been doing a lot of research  and in working with the Venture Financial Crisis Committee  significant problems have been identified  Regulators still think that most fraud occurs within small cap ventures  but society needs to encourage prudent risk taking and entrepreneurs  Fraudsters need to be dealt with by regulators and the criminal justice system  not through regulation  TGR  Where does the retail investor fit into all of this  Is the retail investor the forgotten player  DM  The retail investor is in real trouble  Look at the attendees of any mining conference  They are mostly people around 60 or 70 years old  New regulations being implemented by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada  IIROC  are pushing toward an age limit on Venture investing  If you re over 65  you re asset gathering broker is going to be very reluctant to allow you to participate  You re going to have to go to a discount house  And the young people have a difficult time getting started because they are not yet accredited investors  and consequently are blocked from participating in private placements  buying a block of shares at a discount with a warrant   TGR  Who benefits most from more regulation  DM  More regulation in Canada benefits the banks  Regulation is a growth industry these days and the banks have taken over the Independent Dealers Association  They ve taken over the TSX  In some regards  they even control the regulators  Our finance minister  for example  is an ex banker  Our central banker is an ex banker  The people that rule the regulators are the politicians  and the politicians are all ex lawyers and ex bankers  If you take a look at a mandate for a bank  it s to continue to consolidate and provide more money for its shareholders  It has got no interest in job creation  It has no interest in Venture markets  If they d had their way  the Big Six banks in Canada would have consolidated among themselves  but the government prevented that  TGR  But you can t have it both ways  You can t say that the banks benefit from more regulation  which squeezes out the brokers  and then say they don t want anything to do with junior mining  DM  They don t want the Venture market  They want to gather the assets that people have  If you want into the resource sector  they re going to offer you an exchange traded fund or a fund that they own  The last place they want to send you is to a junior mining company  They don t even want to send you to the senior mining companies anymore  The competition is fiercer than ever  the Australian Small Scale Offering Board  ASSOB   the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  How are we going to compete with these if we re killing off our independent brokers as a source of funding  regulating the retail investor out of the market and forcing our companies offshore  TGR  You believe that that s the ultimate outcome here  DM  One of my clients is heading to Asia next week  If regulators continue to put up all these barriers  Venture money will go somewhere else  They ll create new avenues to find money  Take crowdfunding    it s a relatively new creation  but it s taken off like crazy  Why  It s an easier way to raise money as a startup  Private funding has become much more prevalent in the oil and gas industry  for example  TGR  A consortium of banks  insurance companies and other financial players own the TMX Group  which operates the TSX main board and the TSX Venture  If the junior mining sector dries up  a lot of their fees also dry up  There has to be some incentive for its owners to make it easier for companies to operate and raise capital  DM  Financial institutions are motivated by fees  TD Securities  for example  made  365M in the second quarter of 2012  After dividing the TSX profit for that quarter among the 13 owners of TMX  their portion worked out to  846K  The interest is in selling high end products    senior products  not high risk venture products  The TSX came out in opposition to the latest regulation  which was the revocation of the Northwest Exemption by the British Columbia Securities Commission  BCSC   That could prohibit paying non registered finders to raise capital from all sources of funding  The BCSC said that the impact on capital raising would be about 1   but the TSX Venture said it would destroy between  900M to  1 2 billion   1 2B  of the  6B raised in 2012  That s more than 1   The Venture is starting to feel the pinch  TGR  Some in the junior mining space are calling for an expanded flow through share program to help junior miners raise money  You re against it  You don t think that will fix the problem  That s probably not a popular stance in the mining business  Can you make your case  DM  To quote President Ronald Reagan   If it moves  tax it  If it keeps moving  regulate it  And when it quits moving  subsidize it   Flow through is subsidizing a market that has quit moving  Flow through creates an unfair playing field for the shareholders of publicly traded companies  If I were an American or a European  I d hate flow through  It s unfair  Why does a Canadian get a zero cost base on the same shares with the same rights as I m paying for in hard dollars  TGR  I think part of the problem is that there s not a concerted voice advocating specific solutions for these problems  You re one voice  Newsletter writer John Kaiser is another voice  Sprott Global Resource Investments  Chairman Rick Rule is another voice  Do all of you agree on the solutions  DM  There isn t any one simple solution  Informed  experienced people out of all parts of the industry    regulators  IIROC  the TSX  public company representatives  lawyers  accountants    need to put together a new set of regulations that is exclusively applicable to the Venture Exchange  We are seeing the demise of the Venture Board in Canada  Companies are exploring opportunities in other jurisdictions    just the way manufacturing left the U S  and went to Asia because there was less regulation  fewer costs and the ability to build in more efficiencies  I think the risk is real and we are running out of time  TGR  What about this ASSOB model in Australia  Could that work here  DM  It works there because it s private  It doesn t have the regulators  IIROC and the rest of it  It goes out privately and raises money  It s allowed to advertise  That s what we re competing against  TGR  People are creatures of habit  Maybe some of the younger players will venture off to Asia  but I think the majority will just keep trying to raise money the way they always have  DM  I got off the phone with someone earlier today with a stock that is trading at half a penny  He s going private with it  He s gotten to the point where he doesn t want to deal with the Venture Exchange anymore  because if he does a  0 01 issue  the insiders who have the largest vested interest are only allowed to take down 25  of it  His other option is to sell it off to what he considers potentially parasitic investors that will take down the funding at a penny and sell it for a nickel  He said   The hell with it  I m just going to delist   There s also an interesting case study in Kirrin Resources Inc   KYM TSX V   Kirrin essentially gave up  It discontinued operations and all of its directors and officers resigned  which caused it to no longer meet the exchange s requirements and to have its shares suspended  TGR  How do we reinvigorate the retail space  DM  Here s a question for you  A non accredited investor owns 30K shares of a company  knows the management and likes the company  The company announces it is going to do a private placement    brokered or non brokered  he s not allowed to participate because he s not accredited  Does that make sense  He can buy free trading stock  but he s not allowed to participate in the financing and get a warrant with a company that he s completely comfortable and familiar with  On the other hand  my receptionist  who has never traded a share of stock in her life  can borrow  150K and participate in a financing with somebody that she doesn t know  because that  150K allows her an exemption to the sophisticated investor rule  If she s got  150K  she must be sophisticated  right  Why not allow a non accredited shareholder of a publicly traded company to participate in a financing and have the benefit of the warrant  TGR  What s another solution  DM  If a broker can get a client to sign off on a release that acknowledges the risks involved in participating in a Venture stock  they have no recourse to go back and sue the broker  The front of a prospectus says   high risk investment  you may lose some or all of your investment   We actually advertise the risk involved  Yet nobody minds when Apple stock is sold to retail investors at  700 share and is now trading at  450 share  Nobody seems to mind that somebody s carved  25B off the market cap of Apple  There is always a winner and a loser  that is the way the market works  When it comes to the Venture market  nobody s allowed to play  Even though they ve got regulations  the toughest penalties in the world  oversight on the brokers who are registered and being reviewed and supervised by IIROC  audited financials and security lawyers pushing all the paper through  TGR  Why do you think this story is not getting more traction  DM  This story will get a lot of traction in the coming months because we re going to lose thousands of jobs  Just in my building  two companies just laid off two of their five employees because the principals know how difficult it is to raise money  TGR  One of the counterarguments to all of it is that the good projects will always get the money somewhere  DM  Right now  there are 12 heap leach gold projects in the world with preliminary economic assessments or better  Twelve  That s it  You think you re going to get any more to come onstream with the lack of funding out there  How many of those 12 will go to production in the next 10 years if these markets don t turn dramatically  Maybe the top four  One of the things that happened in 1998 to 2003  when the real commodity prices turned around  was that people went out and dusted off old projects where the economics started to make sense  then spun around and sold them to companies like Teck Resources Ltd   TCK   There are no old projects out there to dust off  There will be no new discoveries if Venture markets can t get funded  The senior companies do not even have exploration teams  There are some companies running around looking for good assets on the cheap right now  We will see merger and acquisition action start to happen  But when that s gone  then what  TGR  Do you think we ll soon start to see a round of capitulation selling  DM  We re already seeing it in the funds  Outflows are forcing redemptions  and the stocks with large institutional holdings are hitting new lows daily  Their stock charts all make nice ski slopes that are flattening out at the bottom  TGR  We ve had some form of a Venture Exchange for 100 years  You re really saying that s all going to come to an end  DM  Yes  For 75 years  it was very efficient  It was a system that flowed and functioned properly  Then in the 1980s  the system went from non negotiable commissions to negotiable commissions  which created the discount houses where the brokers were taken out of the picture  Since then  the banks in Canada and the U S  have managed to overthrow regulations that did not allow them to get involved in the broker  insurance or trust businesses  They ve put their fingers into everything What got the U S  in so much trouble in 2008 were the investment banks  They were involved in arbitrage trading and mortgage backed securities  You name it  they had their fingers in it  and that created the problems  If we d kept banks as banks I don t think we d see these issues  TGR  It seems as if there will need to be some political weight put behind this for changes to be made  Where is that political will going to come from  DM  That s why Joe Martin  the founder of the resource investment conference company Cambridge House  and I built the venturecrisis org website  We knew we needed to get a groundswell movement from within all facets of the industry  Joe is part of the service sector  How would you like to be selling booths to Venture companies right now  His people are dealing with a lot of rejection  The whole service sector is feeling the bite  There s going to be a lot less drilling this year  so there are going to be drillers out of work  Caterers  first aid suppliers  helicopter and airplane providers  line cutters and indigenous populations in the north  too  Accountants and lawyers are working on fewer filings and financings  and are getting fewer fees  At our meetings  we ve actually got independent brokers because they re feeling the pinch  It could have a massive impact on Canada  There is potential risk to our entire economy  I believe we ll start to see the impact this summer  I believe we ll see it in our gross domestic product  TGR  How do people get involved  DM  To start  register on our website    We ll be coming forward with some ideas on there  We re also looking for people to vote in favor of the TSX letter  If we can start with one small thing and have a positive impact  we can go to the BCSC and say   Here s several thousand people voting against this revocation   Maybe we can rally the troops to generate ideas that will start to bring efficiencies back into this market  TGR  If you could say one thing to Canadian security regulators  what would it be  DM  Let me say two things  The first point is mine  The regulators need to focus on market efficiencies  as opposed to retail investor protection  They don t have one mandate  Their website states two mandates  which are to facilitate  A securities market that is fair and warrants public confidenceA dynamic and competitive securities industry that provides investment opportunities and access to capitalThe second point is made in this description of the situation by a person with a prodigious knowledge of the junior capital markets  He said   The BCSC s proposal to revoke the Northwest Exemption seems to be the product of muddled minds  By throwing private placements in public companies in with the completely unregulated exempt market  the BCSC implies that these already overregulated companies are loosey goosey and in need of new rules  like  the unregulated others  In other words  the BCSC s many years of rules  regulations  policies  proclamations  police work and colossal salaries have been for naught  TGR  Thanks  Don  Don Mosher is one of the founders of B D Capital Partners and has over 25 years of experience in the public market with strong connections to several financial

187390,408906,TECK,CIBC s Matt Gibson Sees Upside In Iron In 2013,opinion,Investors who want to play in the iron and copper space should look to small cap producers for attractive valuations and lower risk  says Matt Gibson  institutional research analyst with CIBC World Markets  In this Gold Report interview  he says he believes iron has found its floor in 2012 and names iron ore and copper companies with upside potential  The Gold Report  Matt  you cover four companies in the iron space with market caps that range from Cliffs Natural Resources Inc   CLF NYSE  at  4 2 billion and Labrador Iron Mines Holdings Ltd   LIM TSX  to Alderon Iron Ore Corp   ADV TSX  AXX NYSE MKT  and New Millennium Iron Corp   NML TSX  with market caps around  200 million  In Q1 12  all of them were worth double what they are trading at today  Why should investors be interested in these companies  Matt Gibson  We have started to see positive trends in the iron ore space  Chinese port inventories have started to tick down  while capacity utilization globally and in the U S  has started to tick up for steel companies  Iron ore prices have rebounded from lows of  86 metric ton  Mt  to the  118 120 Mt level  TGR  Are larger companies like Cliffs being punished for their acquisitions or is the across the board share price decline all about low steel prices and global economic fears  MG  I think most of it has to do with iron ore prices and sentiment regarding Chinese growth  For Cliffs  the slow ramp up at its Bloom Lake mine  which has led to elevated cash costs at the facility and lower margins  has not helped  Delays to the planned expansion and the downward revision of the mine plan to an ultimate capacity of 14 Mt have not helped either  Finally  higher operating costs put pressure on the company s balance sheet  TGR  A recent CIBC World Markets  research report stated   Despite elevated inventories of steel and iron ore  Chinese steel mills continue to maintain daily crude steel output near record levels   As you mentioned  that seems to be changing  But is it changing quickly enough  MG  I think China s infrastructure announcement earlier in the fall helped draw down some of the inventories  Certainly  the overcapacity issue in China has a lot to do with the fragmented nature of the industry there  and that will take some time to play out  However  the Chinese government has been putting efforts into consolidating production into larger  more efficient operations  TGR  The Chinese bought in at much higher prices on several juniors in the iron space  Do you think the Chinese regret that decision or was this always about the long term  MG  China s real interest is not so much from an investment point of view as it was about longer term offtake  securing supply of iron ore and being able to diversify away from reliance on the big three producers  TGR  In September  you dropped your 2012 near term iron ore price forecast from  143 Mt cost  insurance and freight  CIF  to  128 Mt CIF  That also caused you to lower your target prices for the four iron companies you cover  Have we reached a bottom to the price drop  MG  Near term  I believe prices found a floor in the  110 120 Mt level  That s pretty much where most estimate the average cost of production to be in China  That being said  the upside or potential price increases will be limited by growth in China and economic growth in Western Europe  TGR  Would you say your view of global economic growth is reasonably bullish  MG  There are some positive indications and I am optimistic that 2013 will be a better year than 2012  and that will be good for the iron ore sector  TGR  Let s move to your coverage  starting with Alderon Iron  Your 12 to 18 month target price on that company is  5 20  more than double its current share price  What about Alderon and its Kami Iron Project engenders that kind of confidence  MG  Alderon s management team has experience developing and building these types of assets  Several people on the management team have a background with Consolidated Thompson or with the Iron Ore Company of Canada  which have operated in the Labrador Trough for a long time  Alderon also has a strong partnership with the largest Chinese steel producer  This is a producer that has only a small fraction of its iron ore supply captive right now  Finally  there are potential catalysts on the horizon  including the release of definitive feasibility studies  rail agreements and permitting  TGR  Cliffs Natural Resources went on a spending spree a few years ago  buying Consolidated Thompson  KWG Resources  Freewest Resources and Spider Resources  among others  Earlier  you attributed some of that drop to issues at Bloom Lake  But do you think Cliffs took on too much in those acquisitions  MG  I think Cliffs got caught in a difficult position when it bought development assets just when prices turned  In retrospect  it looks as if the company may have stretched or overextended itself  but if prices stay stable things will look different a year from now  TGR  You have a Sector Perform rating on Cliffs and a  55 target price  not quite double its current price  What will it take to get Cliffs from here to there  MG  Cliffs needs to get up to full production at Bloom Lake  It has been ramping up and doing a lot of predevelopment stripping for a number of different mining phases  In U S  accounting practices  all of those expenses have to be expensed on the income statement and impact cash costs  In other jurisdictions  those cash costs would be capitalized and amortized over a period  Now that the stripping is done  Cliffs has multiple phases up and running  When Bloom Lake hits the 7 Mt annualized capacity mark  it should be able to drive its costs down on a per tonne basis  TGR  Next  let s talk about Labrador Iron Ore Royalty  It started out as an income trust a form of company that does not exist in the U S  and is now a dividend paying corporation  Why did the company make that change and how will it affect investors  MG  As an income trust  Labrador Iron Ore Royalty was basically a flow through vehicle for the royalty income and dividend stream coming out of the Iron Ore Company of Canada  It was organized that way for tax efficiency purposes  The Canadian government changed its stance on how those types of vehicles are taxed and most of the income trusts converted back into dividend paying corporations  I really do not think anything has changed in how Labrador Iron Ore Royalty will operate  The company also is expanding annual capacity from 17 Mt to 23 3 Mt on an asset at Iron Ore Company of Canada that is run by Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCPK   Increased sales volume from that should contribute to higher royalty income and likely a large special dividend from Iron Ore Company of Canada in the latter half of 2013  TGR  Should shareholders be pleased with this change in structure  MG  The real impact for an individual investor is the change from getting part of the distributions in the form of interest payment  to getting it all as a dividend  For individual investors in Canada  it is more advantageous to receive everything as a dividend  I m not sure about the tax implications for U S  investors  This actually represents one of the lower risk plays in iron ore if you want exposure to iron ore while getting paid to hold the stock  Over the last 12 months  Labrador Iron Ore Royalty has distributed  1 50 share to shareholders  which represents about a 5  yield on the current stock price  The distribution could increase to  2 30 share in 2013  TGR  Is your target price on Labrador Iron Ore still  40  MG  Yes  it is  TGR  The fourth company you cover is New Millennium Iron Ore  It is developing the Direct Ship Ore  DSO  project in Northern Qu bec  Tata Steel Ltd   TTST LSE  TATLY OTC  has already agreed to take 100  of the ore produced  correct  MG  Yes  The DSO Project is under construction  In 2012  it produced around 300 000 tons of sellable product  and will probably do about 2 2 5 Mt in 2013  TGR  The total resource at DSO is 125 Mt  How does that compare to other companies of similar size in this space  MG  The DSO resource base is similar to Labrador Iron Mines Holdings Ltd  s  LIM TSX  resource located nearby  Labrador Iron is more of a seasonal operator and delivers its product through Iron Ore Company of Canada  New Millennium will operate year round in an enclosed structure and sell its product initially through port facilities owned by a local aluminum plant in Sept  les and later through the multiuser port that the Port of Sept  les is now building  That facility should be completed at the end of 2013 or early 2014  TGR  Do you consider it an advantage that 100  of the offtake at DSO has been secured by Tata Steel  MG  I suppose one could see that as a potential risk  But at the end of the day  Tata is the lead operator of the DSO project and New Millennium has a free carry into production  Unless Tata s view of the Corus steel manufacturing facility in the U K  changes  this offtake should be fairly secure and on typical commercial terms priced on international benchmarks  TGR  Do you think New Millennium is secure enough in exchange for that 100  offtake agreement  MG  The offtake agreement gets New Millennium to the point of generating cash flow  making that transaction positive for any junior  Whether it is a fair deal or not  getting DSO up and running was really just an entry point for Tata Steel into the Labrador Trough  The strategic value of that will really be reflected when New Millennium starts developing and getting the larger taconite projects into production  That will require further investment decisions by Tata  The cash flow implications for New Millennium from getting the larger  taconite projects up and running could be a real game changer  TGR  What is taconite  MG  Taconite is a colloquial term used to describe banded iron formations  The investment decision required for the larger taconite project will be predicated on the definitive feasibility study that should be published in the next few months  We expect the investment decision in mid 2013  TGR  How big an issue is transportation for New Millennium at both DSO and the taconite projects  Does it need a rail agreement to induce Tata to sign on to those taconite projects  MG  The taconite project requires a slurry pipeline from the processing facility in the north down to a pelletizing facility in Sept  les  There s potential for New Millennium to sign an agreement with a consortium of the Canadian National Railway and the Caisse de D p t that is contemplating building a new rail line to where this project is going to be located  Canadian National Rail will head up construction and the Caisse de D p t will provide financial backing  It signed a rail agreement for DSO with Qu bec North Shore and Labrador Railway in January 2012  TGR  What is your target price on New Millennium  MG  It is  4 30  almost triple where it is right now  based on a discounted cash flow model  Lately in the Labrador Trough  a lot of players have been painted with the same brush as Cliffs and Labrador Iron Mines  and similar discounts have been applied across the board  But I think New Millennium is operating differently from other startups  TGR  Is that due to its management team  MG  Yes  it is due to a solid management team  This team understands how the business operates and the pitfalls of not owning your own infrastructure  TGR  I would like to move on to copper  Copper traded down in October but looked to be rebounding at the end of November  What is your near term outlook for copper  MG  We see some marginal upside to copper prices in 2013  although not materially higher than today s  3 60 pound  lb   We are forecasting  3 75 lb for 2013  overall  some strength  but limited downside from current price levels  TGR  What is your central thesis for the primary copper plays you cover  MG  Copper remains one of the tightest markets from the fundamental supply and demand perspective  Right now  the junior producers are heavily discounted compared to the more senior players  A lot of the juniors have no value reflected in the market for some of their growth projects  I think development or preproduction plays offer the opportunity to gain a lot of torque to the copper prices albeit with higher risk  They also offer investors the opportunity to participate in derisking projects  growing resources and the potential to rerate when a play moves from development into production  TGR  Which companies do you cover in the copper space  MG  Starting at the top of the alphabet  Augusta Resource Corp   AZC TSX  AZC NYSE MKT  A5R FSE  is really a permitting story at this point  We expect it to obtain its record of decision early in 2013  This is a very robust project from a capital intensive point of view  In terms of upcoming catalysts  Rio Alto Mining Ltd   RIO TSX V  RIO BVL  should come out with some 2013 guidance in January  along with a new reserve calculation and mine plan  We expect its life of mine rates to increase substantially on the back of recent grade reconciliations from production and a previous resource model  as well as exploration results from work done this year  Rio Alto is also starting a regional exploration program on its land package  we expect those results to boost the stock  TGR  How did Rio Alto perform against guidance in 2012  MG  The company revised guidance upward twice in 2012  The original estimate of 100 000 ounces  100 Koz  was revised at midyear to 160 Koz and again to 200 Koz toward the end of the year  We believe Rio Alto will reach 200 Koz  mostly due to positive grade reconciliations  TGR  Rio Alto s La Arena is a massive open pit mine in Peru  What is its expected mine life  MG  Right now the oxide has an expected mine life of about six to seven years for the material close to surface  The sulfide deposit will have a much longer life  Those mine lives are based on what the company has drilled off to NI 43 101 standards to date  It has a large land package  so I would expect the mine life to be extended on the gold side through exploration  TGR  What are your targets on Augusta and Rio Alto  MG  My target on Augusta is  5 share and Rio Alto is  8 share  TGR  Finally  what is up with Western Copper and Gold Corp   WRN TSX  WRN NYSE MKT  and its massive Proven and Probable reserve  MG  That project has the potential to move the needle for a major copper producer  We expect the results of a definitive feasibility study in the near term to provide some clarity around power options for the project  The investment community and potential joint venture partners have both focused on that issue  Clarifying the power issue should pave the way for the company to find a joint venture agreement with a major copper producer or lead to an outright sale of the company  TGR  But the big copper producers do not like to share  Which company could swallow something this large  MG  It would have to be a company the size of a Teck Resources Ltd   TCK NYSE  TCK A TSX   Rio Tinto  BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  or Antofagasta Plc  ANTO LSE   TGR  Do you have any parting thoughts on the infrastructure material space for our readers  MG  In the near term  small cap producers offer some attractive valuations and a lower risk way to play copper compared to development companies  I would look for companies with strong balance sheets  capable management teams and good projected growth over the next five to seven years for near term returns  TGR  And would you include the iron companies in that  MG  Yes  absolutely  The criteria are very similar  TGR  Matt  thanks for your time and your insights   joined

187391,408907,TECK,Gold Will Fall  Time To Switch to Specialty Metals  ,opinion,The U S  and Europe may have been skirting the edge of financial peril for years  but Christopher Ecclestone  who is the principal and mining strategist of London based Hallgarten   Co   told The Metals Report that the gold price should drop this year as investors realize that there s no more cause for panic  However  the frank and expressive Ecclestone has plenty of other suggestions for what s  sexy  this year  zinc  copper and specialty metals   even as he rips into  business as usual  gold majors and chastises any management team with the nerve to offer a 0 5  dividend   The Metals Report  Christopher  you believe that the market will recover in 2013  Why   Chris Ecclestone  We ll have a different type of recovery than we ve had in the past  when everything was driven by the financial industry and house price inflation  The U S  keeps driving along the edge of the cliff like Thelma and Louise  but never actually going over   I get the feeling that there will inevitably have to be a recuperation  The ducks are in the row now for an industrial recuperation probably a construction led one  I m not talking about a rip roaring recovery  but there is such a delicate balance in base metals between supply and demand that it doesn t take much recovery to vacuum up lingering stocks and tip the markets back into a deficit situation again   TMR  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a couple of hundred points away from its all time high  Do you get the sense that retail investor sentiment has changed   CE  Not really  Retail is the last to arrive because retail is not a believer  They re trying to reduce their debts while grappling with flaccid house prices they re not feeling the love yet  It s been said that the equity markets lead six months ahead of the real economy  I suspect it s being driven by institutional and big money   TMR  The ongoing stimulus measures being undertaken around the world seem to point toward a higher gold price  yet you believe that gold will drift lower in 2013  Tell us about that   CE  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will wind down the cash supply as soon as there is stronger growth  He won t stoke the fire the way that Alan Greenspan used to do  where he actually created bubbles  Bernanke was loathe to put out all that extra cash  As soon as he sees signs of a sustained recovery  he will start to rake that money back in and take it out of circulation   Also  the euro collapse is just not happening  It went very near to the edge early last year  but the euro has veered well away from that danger and it s just not going to happen  Anyone who wanted  apocalypse now  is disappointed  That is why the gold price is just drifting at the moment  If there s an economic recovery  there will be even greater pressure for gold to start heading south because people will perceive that the crisis is over  Feelings of crisis have definitely driven gold in the last five years   TMR  Junior mining companies are having trouble landing financing for developing their mining projects  If the economy does improve  will it bring more financing for juniors   CE  They re going to have to continue to wait  There will be a lot of attrition  There are just way too many gold companies out there  Quite a number of them will die off  Some of the others will refocus themselves on industrial metals instead of some totally impractical half gram per ton gold project   TMR  You believe that gold majors have axed their CEOs as a means to appease shareholders  but have also maintained their  businesses as usual  attitudes  What s it going to take for the majors to generate shareholder value   CE  Some of them have dropped their CEOs and the situation has still not gotten better  It s an ongoing ballooning of capital expenditures  Now there s deterioration in margins because of the conditions that they ve made with workers and suppliers during the golden years that are unsustainable  Things will have to be tightened up  These organizations have gotten fat and lazy and axing the CEO doesn t solve that   TMR  Are you willing to name names   CE  I don t need to name names because virtually all of the majors are in that category  You name them  they re like that  They ve had too many good years  The goal is to improve the bottom line  yet there s very little discussion of the bottom line  No one talks about price to earnings ratios in the gold mining world  Some of those ounces in the ground are going to stay there because the capex is rollicking out of control and projects are ending up in the freezer   TMR  You suggest that a merger of Inmet Mining Corp   IMN TSX  and First Quantum Minerals Ltd   FM TSX  could form a major Canada based metals producer  which is currently the exclusive territory of Teck Resources Ltd   TCK   Inmet has rejected First Quantum s offer  Is that deal going to get done   CE  It will get done  Inmet is doomed  The dividend yield it offered has been lousy  First Quantum has a much higher valuation and dividend yield  which just goes to show what gives stock a currency to do these deals  Inmet has missed a lot of opportunities in recent years   TMR  Will we see more of the same type of mergers   CE  Absolutely  First Quantum could move on to be a serial deal doer  It has been collecting other assets in the past  I wouldn t be surprised if Teck does some deals  Then there s Lundin Mining Corp   LUN TSX   Lundin is going to be an acquirer or an acquired entity  Companies are prowling around looking to get their hands on something like Lundin because it s well positioned in zinc  HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM  is another entity that should merge with someone  It had piles of cash after the slump in 2008  but failed to acquire the bargains that were lying around  It made a rather ritzy purchase in Peru of a non producing asset Norsemont Mining Inc   TMR  Your model mining portfolio finished 2012 on a high note  What trends do you see that investors could piggyback on   CE  Gold is not that great at the moment  I thought some of the producers and near producers would have paid off a bit more  such as Eldorado Gold Corp   EGO   which is one of the better managed majors  If you re not getting a dividend from a major  and there s no upside  then you might as well go for a junior where you know you re playing Russian roulette  They could either fizzle or appreciate  but at least you ve got a chance that something will happen  A dull major is pretty damn dull   TMR  How important is a dividend to you   CE  It s important for big producers  It is actually something that the juniors should be pushing for  In Australia  for example  investors often collect their dividends from big producers and then buy juniors with the cash  The Canadian model is that the majors pay a measly dividend and keep the money  making serial overpriced bids for juniors  A yield of 0 50  is derisory  It s just to get the company on to the list of dividend payers  If a company is making  0 40 share and paying out  0 05 share  that s pathetic that s not even worth the effort   TMR  Are there some companies a little lower on the food chain that you re excited about   CE  Investors should look toward specialty metals like tungsten and antimony  or base metals like lead and zinc  Those are the areas where there s a critical shortage of product and a deficiency in the construction of additional mines over the last 10 years  Zinc production will fall as some of the biggest mines in the Western world shut down over the coming year or two  They will not be replaced  the cupboard is bare  That lays out a scenario in which zinc could go from  1 pound  lb  to  1 50 lb in the space of two years  I don t see any potential for major metals to make that type of move   TMR  What are some zinc plays that you re fond of   CE  Some development stories were taken out in the last go round  Farallon Mining Ltd   FAN TSX  and Breakwater Resources Ltd   BWR TSX  were both taken out by Nyrstar  NYR BSE    The no brainer zinc play is Lundin  I can only think of Donner Metals Ltd   DON TSX V  as an up and coming name  Donner partnered with Xstrata Plc  XTA LSE  in the Bracemac McLeod project in Quebec  It is slim pickings out there   TMR  What about industrial metals   CE  I like Mandalay Resources Corp   MND TSX   which is a gold silver antimony play  The phenomenal recent uplift in antimony has been driving the stock  Antimony has been a much better performer than the rare earth elements have  Mandalay s stock has doubled since July and it s very hard to find any production stock that has doubled in the last six months   TMR  Is this a management team that will under promise and over deliver   CE  That s what it s done  It s a pretty low key company  It s a  by appointment only  sort of investment story that people speak about behind cupped hands  There are a lot of companies out there that talk about what they re doing and don t do anything  This company s not as aggressive in promoting its story  but it hasn t damaged its stock price at all   TMR  Where is the future growth going to come from for Mandalay   CE  It did recently announce that it discovered a new zone at its Costerfield mine  The potential to expand there is enormous  It wasn t focusing too much on antimony and then it realized the attractions of that metal  It s certainly the sexiest thing about Mandalay  The antimony is the key at Mandalay if gold and silver start to go down  as I expect them to   TMR  What are some other industrial metal plays you re following   CE  Tungsten  mainly  Tungsten has gotten prospective  There were a lot of companies lining up for the tungsten race in 2011  but 2012 proved to be difficult for financing  The tungsten price dropped from around  450 ton down to  320 ton  That took the wind out of the sails  It s still a phenomenal price for tungsten  but without financing ability  companies mothballed their projects  There s no improvement in what was a pretty dire supply dynamic because China has been restricting its tungsten exports   TMR  How can investors play the tungsten market   CE  Woulfe Mining  WOF TSX V  in South Korea has the world s former largest tungsten mine that it s reactivating   TMR  What about fluorspar   CE  Fluorspar has gone through a difficult period  It s linked to a whole swath of industrial applications that are not that sexy  unlike rare earths  so people didn t notice that there was a crisis brewing when China restricted its exports  A number of companies got going  one of them being Canada Fluorspar Inc   CFI TSX V   It just named a major French partner  Arkema Inc   AKE EPA   It s brilliantly positioned right on the banks of the St  Lawrence  so it s easy to get the stuff out  It s just a case of dusting it off and bringing it to fruition again   TMR  Will Arkema provide the kind of financing it needs to get to that point   CE  It has provided the financing in the past   TMR  Is there a sufficient market for what it will sell   CE  There seems to be a good market for fluorspar  but it s linked to industrial demand  which is starting to look better  However  China is slowing down how much it s devouring and then spilling the leftovers back out into the global markets  But if activity in China picks up  it can allow Western projects to get going again not because they d be selling into China  but because production in China would be staying at home   TMR  What s the earliest date that Canada Fluorspar could be shipping its product   CE  It could be a year or year and a half  The fluorspar mining process is pretty simple because it s largely open cut and not too deep   TMR  Are there any thoughts you would like to leave us with   CE  Base metals require less brain work  It s easier to narrow them down and look at what s there  Specialty metals can create some interesting spikes in prices due to supply crises  But that s really hard to predict because it depends on what happens behind closed doors in Beijing regarding what could be exported in any given year   The supply demand continuum is constantly fluctuating  but there s been an amount of production going off stream  There is so little is coming onstream that it looks pretty good for zinc  lead  copper and chromite  I m less persuaded by nickel at the moment   TMR  Thanks for speaking with us   Christopher Ecclestone is a principal and mining strategist at Hallgarten   Co  in New

187392,408908,TECK,FACTBOX Combined metals assets of Xstrata and Anglo,news,"June 22  Reuters    Swiss based miner Xstrata Plc is seeking
a merger of equals with rival Anglo American Plc  which would
push the group to the top of the world s rankings in copper
mining 
 A merged company  worth about  68 billion  would also be the
world s No 1 zinc miner and move one place up the ladder in
nickel mining 
COPPER
 The proposed combination would create the world s number one
copper mine producer  with output of 1 579 million tonnes on a
2008 basis  according to industry consultants CRU Group 
 Chilean state owned company Codelco is currently the world s
largest copper miner 
 The combined entity would also be the world s third biggest
copper refiner  with 1 033 million tonnes on a 2008 basis 
 Anglo s copper assets include the Los Bronces expansion in
Chile  the Quellaveco project in Peru and Michiquillay 
 The two companies also hold 44 percent stakes each in the
large Collahusi mine in Chile 
 Xstrata s other copper operations and projects include    
Antamina and Las Bambas in Chile  El Pachon in Argentina and
Ernest Henry 
 
 ZINC
 A merged company would be the world s largest zinc mine
producer on a western world basis  CRU figures suggest 
 They would have produced a combined 1 316 million tonnes 
based on 2008 figures  ahead of Teck Cominco with 663 000
tonnes 
 In refined production the combination would briefly move up
to fifth place with around 650 000 tonnes of metal  But India s
Hindustan Zinc continues to expand and would overtake
Xstrata Anglo within a matter of months 
 The 150 000 tonnes per year  tpy  Skorpion operation in
Namibia is Anglo s key zinc asset 
 Anglo s lead mines are not particularly large and their
addition to Xstrata s assets would not alter world rankings 

 NICKEL
 Last year Xstrata ranked fourth place in terms of 2008
global nickel mine output  with Anglo 11th 
 Based on those figures  a combined entity would move up to
third place with total output of 135 000 tonnes 
 The world s top nickel producer  Russia s Norilsk Nickel
recently said it aims to produce 285 000 300 000 tonnes of
nickel this year 
 
 PLATINUM
 Anglo owns the world s largest platinum producer  South
Africa s Anglo Platinum  which produced around 2 4 million oz of
the precious metal last year 
 Xstrata is building up its platinum business in South
Africa 
 
 OTHER ASSETS
 Xstrata says it is the world s largest producer of
ferro chrome and a leading producer of primary vanadium 
 It also says it is the world s largest exporter of thermal
coal 
 Anglo says it is a leading producer of iron ore  manganese
and carbon steel 
 It also produces coal  industrial minerals and owns 45
percent of the world s largest diamonds producer De Beers
