Prepared Remarks 
Unidentified SpeakerGood morning  and welcome to Franklin Resources  Earnings Conference Call for the Quarter Ended December 31  2019  Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources  Inc   which are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 These forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking

I d like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO  Mr  Greg Johnson  Mr  Johnson  you may begin Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerHello  and thank you for joining us today to discuss first quarter results  With me is President and Chief Operating Officer  Jenny Johnson who will be assuming the role of CEO next month and Matthew Nicholls  our CFO  Financial results improved this quarter reflecting strong financial markets and our ongoing commitment to effective expense management  which drove improved profitability We continue to experience outflows this quarter for reasons discussed in the commentary we released earlier this morning  But we are encouraged to see traction in several important initiatives  including our efforts to expand our multi asset solutions and ETF businesses  We also believe that our balance sheet is one of our most under appreciated assets as we evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth Earlier this month  we announced plans to acquire two companies that will expand Fiduciary Trust s assets under management by 50  and expand their physical presence in two important markets  We also returned approximately  260 million to shareholders through share repurchases in our regular dividend this quarter  which the Board increased to  0 27 per share in December After more than 15 years  my role as CEO of the firm will come to an end after our annual meeting next month  I m very confident in Jenny s leadership and vision for the future of Franklin Templeton and together  we are genuinely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead While this will be my last call with you as CEO  I will remain Executive Chairman of the Board and will continue to participate on our earnings calls going forward  I d now like to open the line for your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  Our first question today is coming from Ken Worthington from J P  Morgan  Your line is now live Kenneth Worthington    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  thank you  So you ve done a couple of bolt on acquisitions in Wealth Management  So a couple of questions around that  So first  why are you thinking wealth management is a good place to invest here  Maybe you can flesh out  are there synergies between wealth threat management and the rest of Franklin and maybe any dis synergies as well  And then may be cleaning up  I think when you guys bought Fiduciary  I think it s like 20 years ago  I remember it had about maybe  15 billion or so of AUM  I could be wrong  but that s my recollection  And I don t think it s all that much bigger today maybe  15 billion to  20 billion these days for these deals  So it hasn t really grown that much  if at all  over the last 20 years  So  given you re doing a bunch of bolt ons  how do you expect to do a better job growing these wealth management assets today  than at least my perception of what you ve done over the last 20 years Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerI ll go ahead and take that  Today  post acquisition I think Fiduciary is about  29 billion and there s no question  wealth is hard to grow  but it s incredibly sticky  once you have it  And we think that it s both important for us as a firm from a distribution  but also as you re seeing  fee based advisors trying to add more services  you justify basically the fee that their clients pay every month  They re trying to add on more than just investment management And so  some of the capabilities that Fiduciary has  we think can be packaged to be able to provide additional services to advisors  For example  in this most recent acquisitions  we not only expanded into two geographies that are excellent geographies to be in for wealth management  but we added services  So Athena Capital is incredibly well known for their impact investing in OCIO We think that Dr  Lisette Cooper can be helpful to us in more of the issue work that we re very focused on doing as well as Pennsylvania Trust has special needs trust capabilities  which is essentially helping families who have a child with special needs and not worried about how to care for them beyond the say  the parents surviving  and that s an opportunity of growth  But that also can be something that we can work with our financial advisors as they have clients with those needs  We can bifurcate both the trust administration as well as the investment bifurcate  Phonetic  capability on it Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerI think I ll just add something to that  it s Matthew  The multiple that we pay for the    for these businesses is reasonable  we think  and it helps us capitalize on some of the broader expenses that we have embedded within Fiduciary Trust  So essentially by having more assets and clients  it makes our overall wealth business more efficient  This is probably the beginning of our strategy to grow Fiduciary Trust  this is the second leg  if you will  You re right  Ken  it s been a number of years since we ve had a growth strategy around it inorganically But we    it wouldn t surprise us if we doubled the size of Fiduciary Trust over the next year or two  by using this strategy Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would just add  I think we ve always had that    as you know  being on these calls for years  it s always been a goal of ours to    within our M A to increase the size  but I think there s just a few more opportunities today with some of the pressure on smaller firms keeping up  keeping pace with technology  spending and services that are required for their investors  So we re just seeing a few more opportunities for roll ups Kenneth Worthington    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  And then just really broadly Jenny  you re now officially    or going to be officially in the role of CEO  Maybe just highlight your priorities for the next two or three years  What are you hoping to accomplish  Any directional changes that is worth highlighting to us  Thank you Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerYou know  I think we    you know  it s continuing on a path that we ve been focused on for the last couple of years  which is  we bucket the business and growth opportunities  kind of in three places  so one is just protecting the core and that s making sure that the products and capabilities that we have are best in breed  and if you think about on the investment management side  there has been a lot of focus and efforts around leveraging data science to enhance what we re doing on our core products And I think our fixed income team has done some really exciting new things combining active and quant  So again  it s just making sure that you have best in breed in your existing core and then from the second category is what we call growth accelerators  things like growing our high net worth business  things like expanding in geographies that maybe we re not as deepened as we d like to be  adding product capability that maybe were not as strong in or don t have as much coverage  And then also distribution capabilities  So for example  we ve always been really under represented in US institutional that would be an area of interest for us to continue to grow And then finally  I think we would all be foolish not to believe that the technology industrial revolutions that s existing today is going to have disruption on our businesses  So making sure that we re investing in things that may be won t be meaningful or material in even the next five years  but that we think could be very disruptive to the business over the long run And so that s    you see some of the investments that we re doing in things like a token vault  and also our innovation lab  which really just enables us to keep an eye on where the industry is evolving Kenneth Worthington    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank  Your line is now live Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystGreat  Thanks  good morning folks  Maybe just to start off with the    obviously the global fixed income franchise and the increase in outflows  maybe just if you can talk about what you re saying to the financial advisors  we ve seen sales obviously come down there pretty sharply in the last three quarters  and even also weighing a little bit on the global equity side  So maybe the conversations with advisors  how that s going  Maybe that sort of the tempo into January  and with that Morningstar reclass  I guess  would you say there is a certain level of AUM that might be at risk  just based on that reclass in the performance or maybe just a little extra color around that Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think first and foremost  I mean the messaging is really that one  this    it doesn t fit neatly into any category  So I think the people that are familiar and have sold the fund do it for defensive purposes  They do it  because it lowers the risks clearly against the big drivers of the interest rates and market beta and it really complements portfolios well  So that s the messaging that we continue to drive through the retail side and I think some of the heightened redemptions that you saw toward the end of the quarter or the end of the year  I think some of that is always tax driven in selling when you have a sector in a very strong bull market that had a tough period That will be something that you ll just see heightened levels of redemptions and we ve seen that come off a bit  It s hard to kind of gauge what the reclassification can do  I can just say it from experience with this asset class is how quickly it moves around  And just with geopolitical events and movements within global macro  we can see quick rebounds and performance really within a week or two So  and I think the    most of our advisors and shareholders are    understand that and that s just the messaging that we want to continue to drive  But this is a defensive way  that s not co related to many of the drivers in your market and continue to reinforce that message and how it s done in past down cycles  but it s clearly defensively positioned and that s the messaging that we continue to drive Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd I think they did a very good piece on the Corona virus and just reminding whether or not this one is going to be a very serious epidemic or not that you always have tail risk in portfolios and it s good to have that diverse portfolio  And this is an insurance policy positioned very defensively  And that has been well received by clients Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystAnd so are you seeing improvement in the flow momentum in January versus what we saw late in the fourth quarter  In this area Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I would say still pressure but definitely better than what we saw in the prior quarter  The redemption side is a lot better Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystGreat  thanks  And then maybe just back to the M A strategy  maybe as you think about through diversifying into different areas  or expanding that Fiduciary high net worth strategy  is it and also in the commentary about the undervalued balance sheet and the  3 5 billion of excess cash  we    if you  Phonetic  guys just maybe becoming more of a roll up of other private wealth managers over the long term and if so  is that more of a sort of a bolt on strategy or would you actually try to be more toward have a strategy of more like integrating those firms into Fiduciary and having it be a large integrated platform Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think it s a combination of those two things and wealth  It s both integration of certain aspects of the business  Brian  but it s also a potential roll ups  I think we should make clear  this is more of a    we don t expect to expand it broadly across wealth management It s a specialized ultra high net worth franchise where we see significant opportunities in different states with different client bases that  as I mentioned a second ago  capitalize on the foundation that we have with Fiduciary Trust  So that s what this is all about  So we shouldn t confuse that important aspect of our strategy with what we re doing overall as a Company We do have many other aspects of the growth that we re focused on this  Jenny just pointed out  including across the traditional asset management business  distribution  various products  alternatives  institutional  for example  and some of those ideas are much larger ideas that are in our pipeline and as we move quarter to quarter where    our list is getting shorter and shorter in terms of where we would actually take action  we hope in the next year Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystOkay  So we should expect more utilization of the balance sheet for M A over the next say  a couple of years or so Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question today is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse  Your line is now live Craig Siegenthaler    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Good morning everyone Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Craig Siegenthaler    Credit Suisse    AnalystJust looking at the decline in expenses and the guidance too  how are you able to invest in new technologies  distribution and also product  while also able to reduce total cost Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerOkay  So I ll take that  So I mean in one of the things that you over time we ve always had a global footprint  and so there has been opportunity for us to ship positions to lower cost regions as well as historically as a global provider there were often not service providers who could really accommodate our global platform And so  we always had to keep these things in house and it s hard when you keep it in house until we scale it  And so  most recently we announced an outsourcing of some portion of our fund administration  And then I would say  just getting better at looking at massive amount of data like a market data research and finding opportunities there where historically that was probably managed more by the investment teams needs as opposed to centrally and finding out where you have overlap So it s just continuing to scour through and figuring out where those opportunities exist Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerI think the other thing on that is we ve candidly just become in fairly short order  I would say much more disciplined about investing in projects that we see really moving the needle and moving away from a sort of hobby type  luxury type investments that we were making in our business for good reasons candidly  but given the shift in the environment we ve just gotten much more disciplined about that And frankly we found other areas within the cost structure that provide more flexibility in the event that the market continues to be challenged  So I think our guidance has moved a little bit as we ve noted in our prepared remarks to the positive in terms of the costs that we can reduce and we re very confident about the flexibility of our cost structure Craig Siegenthaler    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Matthew  And just as my follow up  I have one on US distribution  What is your business strategy for targeting US RIAs  Phonetic  and I m talking outside of Fiduciary Trust and Athena and Penn Trust  it s the fastest growing segment of US Wealth and within that  what sort of Franklin products are you finding the RIAs most interested in Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerThe RIAs want more    less kind of traditional and then to the extent its traditional ETFs are obviously very popular  So SMAs are popular there and as we talked about  we hired somebody to run our SMA business and that s starting to grow  Our ETFs had its best quarter ever with  1 2 billion as a matter of fact the launch of our FLCO  which is our core bond was I think the third fastest growing ETF in 2019 So those are interesting for that channel  but how do you really get mindshare of the RIA  and that s what we re talking about those additional services as the RIAs had to grow their business into more of a wealth management business finding ways that we can have tools and take some of the capabilities that Fiduciary Trust provides to its clients to provide its value added services that aren t particularly more costly for us to add to it  but can be leveraged more broadly there Craig Siegenthaler    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Thank you  Jenny OperatorThank you  Our next question today is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research  Your line is now live Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research LLP    AnalystHey  good morning guys  First one on these kind of bolt on deals of Fiduciary Trust  how should we think about those running through the financials from a revenue and operating income standpoint and then maybe more broadly through the lens of the comment about doubling it  how should we think about future AUM or each deal adding to results over the    as they come through Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think    Good morning  Patrick  I think the way to think about the two transactions that we ve announced  bearing in mind that Athena closes in February and Pennsylvania Trust closes in April  is that they ll add collectively about  0 015 to  0 02 a share to earnings  The margin is roughly in line with our margin as a Company  but we see expansion opportunities there  And future transactions that we may be looking at are very similar to that in proportion to the size of these transactions So I think that s the level of detail we re willing to give at this point Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research LLP    AnalystGreat  that s helpful  thanks  And then on the commentary  should we take that you are not calling out any specific redemptions to mean that there aren t any as you have in the past couple of quarters Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerThere are some that we are aware of  I think there is a  1 1 billion  we just don t know when it comes in  We don t have    we don t  we re not aware of any specific dates this quarter that any episodic redemption is coming in Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think the way to say it is that we re early in the quarter  with a better net flow picture so far  and we have very little known large episodic outflows  so that s why you don t see it written into the commentary Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  And I would just add  I mean it    we just in the past  it s hard when you know one or two and you don t know the timing and sometimes it s better not to say anything when we release our asset levels on a regular basis  Of course  there s still going to be pressure from the VA business and just trying to get the timing sometimes is very difficult  but there is still going to be larger redemptions coming on that side  as we ve talked about in the past Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research LLP    AnalystThank you  Helpful Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies  Your line is now live Daniel Fannon    Jefferies   Company    AnalystHi  thanks  I guess just to follow up on that  I guess  could you give us the level of assets left in that VA business at this point Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI think it s like  35 billion  but again  we ll    if that s way off  I ll get back to you  but I think that s about somewhere around that number  Not all of that obviously is at risk  It s just some of the    that business  as we ve said before has been under a transition from using funds to using different lower vol models and index like products and lower cost products  and we ve been transitioning our business in part of our solutions and we ve actually been able to retain some of those accounts by switching them into the new model So I think that  that    we re hopeful that  that can be a growth business instead of one that s been in constant decline as the traditional funds have been under pressure Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd I will confirm Greg s number Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Jenny looked it up  so  it s good support Daniel Fannon    Jefferies   Company    AnalystAll right  thank you  And then just as a follow up in the commentary you talked about the Income Fund  and you mentioned yield being a bigger factor for kind of investment decisions in over necessarily potentially performance  but we ve seen outflows increase in the last three quarters  redemption levels growing  performance there obviously has come in So can you talk about again just to that fund and that category and how we should think about it on a go forward basis based on either platforms or kind of distribution partners and how they re thinking about that fund in the context of everything else Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean I will start and just say that first and foremost  I mean  the yield is 2 5 times its category yield  So it s a very different creature than where it s measured against  And again  most advisors appreciate that fact  So you re going to have more duration risk if rates go up like they did in that    in the quarter and generally a little more credit risk than maybe the category  The other big factor  as we talked about it before is how this fund fits into the new landscape of fee based versus the traditional brokerage model and it s less    less of an opportunity for sales in the fee based world that s building models and we re building models as well and adapting our product lineup and solutions to meet that  but the traditional 40 Act fund of the Income Fund is under that secular pressure So it s hard to gauge how much of it  I don t think a lot of it s really performance related  I think you still are going to be under pressure as people transition to fee based  and we do our best  and as that settles  it s still always going to be attractive in the brokerage world  But there is other markets like we re just introduced in Europe in our SICAV lineup and hopefully we could gain some of what we lose in those redemptions Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd I ll just add  The category has got a decline of about 2  and we were up 4   and the Income Fund specifically gross sales were up 28   So the strategy to Greg s point  the category is much lower yielding and so it often gets dinged in its measurement there  but clients love the yield  And we think there is huge opportunity for the SMA business on that product So it s been around 70 plus years for a reason Daniel Fannon    Jefferies   Company    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Mike Carrier from Bank of America  Your line is now live Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning and thanks for taking the questions  We ve hit on M A a little bit and I guess just one question on that  and one follow up  just when you look at the backdrop  obviously you guys have been more active on the wealth side  but you ve mentioned some product areas  distribution areas that you re more interested in I was just curious  when you look at the competitive backdrop  whether it s pricing  how you re thinking about returns on investments whether it s in Wealth or Asset Management  just kind of an update on how you re thinking about just given that you re spending more time on that area and how you see that kind of playing out Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  no market cycle is perfect in terms of when you should execute inorganic transactions and this is obviously no exception  given the fact that we re at the height of the asset class prices across nearly every asset class that we re in  And that we re interested in growing  So that part is a tough one to answer Other than the fact that we think the areas that we re looking at in particular will make us as a firm  more efficient and better utilize expensive resources that we have  that are very important for the future of our firm in a stand alone basis and we think we can make acquisition targets more efficient and more attractive for them  and even more so it s like a multiplier effect when you put the two things together  That s point one In terms of what we look at around metrics and hurdles and such  I would just say that we look at a number of quantitative and qualitative metrics  including how the transaction could increase the return of our current assets  which I just referred to  for example  distribution is a very important one  Appropriate risk rated    sorry  risk adjusted discount rates precedents  comps  the basic principle of achieving a return in excess of our own cost of capital  The things that you re very familiar with  we re very focused on Frankly in a very  very simple level  you can see the size of our cash resources and turning that cash into a positive catalyst in terms of increasing our earnings and making our firm more efficient capitalizing what we see to be a pretty exciting future in many areas  notwithstanding the pressure on the industry is what we re very focused on So it s really a combination of all of those    all those things  Mike Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerAnd I would just add that as we said before  I mean  looking at a Benefit Street type  when you say what do    how do we look at the world and landscape  and that s a classic example of an emerging category that is passive proof and one that we think is going to grow very well and one that we think we can add value to distribution and I would say  all of those are being validated to date as we continue to bring new products out and are ready to benefit from some of those positionings in the next year or so  And I think again we look at the landscape it would be more on lower cost institutional managers that we can then build into our retail relationships versus the older higher cost 40 Act type managers We d be more focused on that and then technology  anything we can accelerate and look at platforms for distribution that could be helpful and build globally  those are the other areas that we think could be very important to us  And then finally I d say as we said before alternatives  real estate  again passive proof of the categories  private equity  things like that  that really build out our alternatives group and then have the specialization of distribution in those categories and have the kind of breadth that allows us to have the specialization would be where we re heading Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystRight  that s helpful and then  just a quick follow up maybe on the organic newer areas like the SMAs  models  multi assets  I guess on one hand  you guys have the distribution  and you have long track records in a lot of the products  the other hand  some of the performance challenges in the near term  a bit of a hurdle  So just want to get an update on how much maybe be traction you re seeing on that front  and do you need some of the shorter term performance to shift in order to see that pick up Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean I ll let Jenny follow me  but I don t think the    you know the challenges of    we have because of our asset mix and styles of the Templeton with the value discipline and a mutual with the value discipline doesn t mean that your solutions business and your SMA business can t be successful and they are not required to put those in the portfolios  if they think that  that style is not appropriate in this cycle So I don t think it s held back at all  We ve been very successful getting our models into the larger distribution platforms and are seeing some growth there today  So I don t think the performance issues of just style of value versus growth and again if you look at our growth funds and how well they are doing across the board that they certainly are solutions benefits from that today as does our retail flows Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  as Greg mentioned  you know  certain newer categories for us or where we put more resources SMAs are up  as he mentioned the model portfolios  and I think we talked on the prior call about a couple of wins we ve had there  assets are up 45  from the same period a year ago  hitting  1 billion and good traction  Once you get in the model  you still have to go sell it through all the individual financial advisors in the firm and provide that kind of support  but we ve had good traction there and then having already mentioned ETFs  we were actually the fastest growing firm with as far as the US ETF issuer with assets above  1 billion last year So these are all where we think the vehicles in which investment management is getting delivered in this new kind of fee based model and we ve got good traction in those areas Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  thanks a lot OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS  Your line is now live Brennan Hawken    UBS    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks for taking my questions Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Brennan Brennan Hawken    UBS    AnalystHello  One on the SMA  and your guys approach there considering the expansion of that offering into the broker sold channel  Just curious about when you think about it  what portion of your products do you think makes sense in that wrapper and whether or not you need to make further investments as those    as those assets ramp  Because obviously you ve got the wholesalers into the sales effort which is clear But it s my understanding that you need sort of trading pipes and other automated connectivity into each of those platforms  does that require any further investment  or are you guys already there Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo I would say that  that is what we ve been working on  as I mentioned bringing in the new head of SMAs  I think we learned a bit more about what we needed to do and I think we re in a good place today Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd it s not something we ve been in that business for over 20 years and so it hasn t been a big emphasis for us  but Templeton had a very focused group early on and we ve been in the muni business for a long time as well than SMAs Brennan Hawken    UBS    AnalystAnd the part of the question about which portion of the lineup might make sense for that wrapper  because some    not all of will since you need to own the underlying securities Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerWell  so the way the industries have uptick the Income Fund  right  there are securities in there that the individual client can t own on the statement and so you just do a completion mutual fund  and so we have launched a few of those  So for example  the underlying equities and bonds that are appropriate to be on the client statement would be there and then anything that the client can own individually  the advisor would allocate that to the completion fund Brennan Hawken    UBS    AnalystGot it  Okay  thanks  That helps  And a follow up on the trends you guys have seen here in January  certainly encouraging that the flow trends have moderated but can you help us understand why that is necessarily indicative of the best way to think about the path forward because it is just one month and when we look at the last three quarters  the redemptions seem to have accelerated each quarter and that s coincided with the deterioration in performance So is there something specific about when the calendar flipped  that should translate into that trend proving sustainable or maybe a little more color on that would be great  Thank you Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean I think it s hard  I think January is generally a better month  number one  December you generally have higher redemptions in that quarter for tax selling and year end and slower sales because there s a lot going on in December and January generally is just a better month in terms of flows You know  it s hard to gauge how much of that is tax selling and where obviously for us if you  again  it s hard to say take the global bond out of the equation  because that s been a big driver of flows both ways  But if you look at the last quarter  we had three major categories and inflows  which would have been a very positive story  if we didn t have the acceleration of  6 billion of outflows within Global Bond So I think you re right in asking that question  where does it go  I think there was more pressure for the quarter  and as I said before  things moved quickly in terms of relative short term performance and we already have seen some recapture and performance in the quarter to date with global bonds  So that can move quickly and we ve seen it in past cycles  how quickly it went from outflows to moving back to inflows Brennan Hawken    UBS    AnalystFair enough  Thanks for the color OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs  Your line is now live Alexander Blostein    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystHey  thanks  I just wanted to follow up on the    the one of the things you guys mentioned earlier regarding acquisitions to build out Fiduciary Trust and I think you said you expect to double that asset base over the next year or two  So maybe could you just spend a couple of minutes on the EBITDA multiples you re seeing the space that you re comfortable paying the competitive dynamics in that corner of the market  because I think there s a lot of businesses you would like to add scale and presence in that corner of the wealth management industry and what are the key selling points at the end of the day  Is it a one off discussions  or are there more competitor  kind of why do people decide to sell it to Franklin Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  I ll take that part and then why don t you talk about the multiples in EBITDA  You know  you re absolutely right  when you talk of these financial advisors  they re usually at a point where  as Greg mentioned are feeling that they can t continue to invest in technology when the regulation and the requirements around really adding all these wealth capabilities it because    they realize they are subscale and there are a lot of buyers  The two acquisitions that we did chose us and they chose us because Fiduciary Trust has been around since the 1930s  it was set up by five high net worth families  It is really marquee ultra high net worth business that understands multigenerational asset management and the issues that go much beyond just figuring out investment returns And so it will always be a competitive space  and it will be a space where they re looking at their clients who they know well and saying  who is going to be the best stored of these assets  And so that s what we think is our big selling point Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And I think in terms of the multiple in the price in the competition for these assets  I think  Alex  what you may be referring to is the broader wealth management business  of course  we know that private equity and other wealth managers in the mass affluent wealth space are very  very active and some of the EBITDA multiples being discussed here in 15  16 times plus area even in businesses that don t actually have the acquisitions closed yet  for example  So it is a very highly competitive space from a rollout perspective because the economics just make so much sense In this area that we re focused on with the multiples  a little bit lower  I d say so  say in the low double digits to ten times to low double digits area and that becomes more efficient for us upon the connection collaboration and to a certain degree integration with Fiduciary Trust that becomes very economically compelling to us and as Jenny mentioned the reason for us versus others is there are really a very small handful of very focused  pure ultra high net worth wealth managers  The services that you need to provide are very expensive to invest in and to retain and to have the right team to provide it  And I would say they re very specialized across the whole sleuth of different advisory solutions  if you will for sophisticated ultra high net worth folks So that s why we think we re a good home  just as Jenny mentioned we ve become a sort of coming together of both sides  Not as necessarily going out and scouring the ground  We re also finding that upon the announcement in these transactions and news getting out of our interest through Fiduciary Trust  that there are more than we actually thought in the marketplace and there are several very important dates in the US that contain other sorts of firms in the  3 billion to  6 billion   7 billion AUM area that will also be a very good fit for Fiduciary Trust in our strategy Alexander Blostein    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystGot it  That s very helpful  Thanks  The    my follow up question was just a quick one around expenses  I apologize  you mentioned it earlier  but if you look at the guidance  I think you re guiding to a down 2 5  expense growth for fiscal 2020 versus  19  I just want to confirm that off  Phonetic  of the total expense base of about  2 4 billion last year and that s inclusive obviously of the deals that you announced  So there is going to be a little bit of revenue that s going to come through with that as well  So maybe just kind of confirm the expense number for this year and help us think about the revenue contribution for this year from the deals that you are planning to close  Thanks Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI d confirm that on the expense side  And I would also confirm that  that guidance is inclusive of the transactions that we ve just announced  We re not going to separate out the revenue yet until that becomes a larger line item  but our guidance generally speaking on the expenses consistent where we expect revenue to be also So we    as we have done this quarter and the same with last quarter  Our objective is to do our very best to have positive operating leverage in the business and I would say that would be our guidance for 2020  So our guidance of 2  to 2 5  perhaps even a little bit more expense reduction based of 2019 that you referred to  Alex  I would say that on the revenue side  we d hope to be better than that Alexander Blostein    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystGot it  Great  thanks so much Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW  Your line is now live Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystGreat  thanks  Thanks for taking my questions this morning  This may be more of a philosophical question  But if I think of the growing the high    the ultra high net worth business  that I think some of the investments you re making in various platforms  you know  is there a desire or need here to try to get closer to the end asset owner  I mean one of the challenges for the industry broadly has always been there is someone between you and the ultimate owner of the asset So do you think that that s an important part of kind of your strategy  you re trying to get closer to who actually owns the asset and pulls a trigger Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  yeah  So I mean we are still big believers in end financial advisor providing advice  We are not believers that the robo advisor is going to  and the machine is going to  in the end intermediate that Financial Advisor  You know these things like robo advisors  we think is more akin to a TurboTax which was going to put all CPAs out of business and now the CPAs are the big users of TurboTax So the key for us is what kind of as the advisor adds more wealth management capabilities what platforms can we invest in to get closer to that end advisor to be able to influence and help them be better at their business and so as we think about our investments on the technology side  it can be things like financial planning or other kind of tools that the advisor is expanding beyond just investment capabilities Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystGreat  And maybe just a quick follow up  I mean there s clearly a lot of discussion on M A on the call  but maybe this is a question  just to confirm what you re not interested  And I assume you re continuing to not be interested in any kind of scale driven merger Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI don t think that s accurate  to be frank  We don t want you seem like we are looking at every single thing on the planet there  as I ve said in    or as we said on previous calls  we re out there  very few transactions that contain an element of scale in it  that would make sense for us  but there s certainly others that contain that  And that is on our shortlist Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think the point is  it we would never be first on the list of combining something for the sake of cost cutting and scale  We may get that secondarily as a benefit out of it  but it s really about bringing in areas that complement the firm and areas that we believe are going to be strong areas of growth in the future  but that certainly doesn t eliminate the benefit of certainly distribution and scale and things you can get out of that  Yeah  I mean we could  for example  consolidate an operation in the US  but remembering that what that business may contain would be applicable to many countries overseas that we re in that perhaps that party is not in Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystFair enough  I appreciate it  Thank you Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Rob OperatorThank you  Our next question today is coming from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley  your line is now live Michael Cyprys    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  good morning  Thanks for taking the question  Maybe just following on the Fiduciary Trust build out  hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the strategy there and talk about what you re looking for in firms that you might acquire and maybe you could talk a little about your process there  How you sift through and identify and prioritize and what your ultimate vision here is Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerI ll let Matt handle the    how do we sift through  Again there are financial advisors that are    that are almost family offices or really wealth managers that have done very  very well up until now  And the regulatory environment and the demands on services have increased  And  you know they re looking at their business and they re thinking  I want to add more things  but it s just difficult to scale this And so  they re looking for home with a firm that understands the wealth business  and the ultra high net worth business is about investment returns  it s about trust and the state planning  it s about tax efficiency and it s about education in the next generation of wealth  And the wealthier and the older you get  the next generation education becomes the most important part of that And so if they re looking at their clients  they want to make sure that they re connecting with the firm that can provide longevity and also has that same core culture of understanding what it takes to really manage for a high net worth family  and not all the roll ups that are happening out there    they re meshing both the ultra high net worth with mass affluent and that becomes a danger of diluting kind of a capability that you provide for the ultra high net worth Matt  I don t know if you want to talk about it Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean  and look we have  as I mentioned a moment ago to Alex s question  we have financial discipline around these things  So obviously we want to make sure that it s going to work financially for us upfront in terms of the multiple  and then there s various earn out structures and performance targets that we have against the business I think that the    where that base location is very important in terms of limiting disruption obviously is always very important  the point Jenny made around diluting  the last thing we want to do is dilute the specialized nature of what Fiduciary Trust does and frankly the targets that we    or the partners of future companies that we could own that s exactly how they feel as well  They don t want    what they do to be diluted in any way by what we do  So when we re having these discussions  it s really a coming to a mutual understanding very rapidly that what we re trying to achieve is the same goal ultimately So  the summary is  we re financially disciplined  obviously  it needs to make sense for us a very good use of our cash and it s a very good use of an asset sort of pretty frankly being a little bit under appreciated in the overall scheme of things  Fiduciary Trust  so Michael Cyprys    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  And just as a follow up maybe on the ETF side  I was hoping you could elaborate on the ETF strategy I think about  7 billion in AUM is where you are today  But just curious as well around that what the interest or appetite there is to scale that may be in a more quickly more material way through inorganic means and what scenario could that makes sense or maybe you add some other geographic regions and more strategies around that Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo we re    we launched in US  Canada and Europe and looking at Asia  we are quite happy with our growth  We were one of the first multi factor smart beta issuers and actually that s the biggest group of assets  The second is our active ETFs and the third is our passive which are the cheapest  actually passive in the category that they re in  And the challenge with ETFs is  you always have to get scale to be able to attract the institutions And so  we re starting to see more and more flows there every day and I think that it probably if the right opportunity came up  we d certainly entertain it  but at this point the    we re focused on just  we have a great team  and the growth there Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would just add  I mean  it    as you know  I mean like anytime you get in a new business  it takes a few years  the big distributors wait and I think we re at that critical point where we ve been out good performance in many of the ETFs and getting on all of pretty much all of the platforms now So I think that s the big change of where we are in the cycle  So we re optimistic that  that can that will really accelerate growth Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd from a scale  for example  we are  I think it s launching this month  three thematic ETFs that are the Franklin genomic  the disruptive commerce  and intelligent machines and we re basically leveraging the team that runs our Dynetek fund to be able to provide those  because there was feedback from clients in that they wanted some specialized type products that    thematic products  so you re able to scale existing teams that are historically have been doing traditional mutual funds Michael Cyprys    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore  Your line is now live Glenn Schorr    Evercore    AnalystHi  just one follow up to your comments earlier on Benefit Street and one micro  one macro  At the micro level  I m just curious if you could update us on anything related to performance  new products and distribution penetration that you ve seen  now that they re part of the family  and then at the higher level  curious how you re thinking about addressing other private asset classes across PE  real estate  infrastructure and things like that  Thanks Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Maybe I ll just start with the BSP and I think as we said before  it s not something you just plug and expect to see flows on the retail side  it s a complex  more complex product set up and we set up interval funds for the retail  for retail distribution in both the US and in Europe  And we ve also this year are planning on having a BDC offering with one of the major distributors here in the summer and all of these are going to be meaningful in terms of flows this year So I think we re very pleased with performance  with the pace and how we ve gotten our distribution kind of lined up behind it  And it s    it is a more complex sale that we ve learned  but we ve done a lot of training and continue to be very optimistic there  I think the difficulty when you say the tactics around the other asset classes  it s very hard to go out and just buy  as you know buy real estate or buy private equity and so it s performance  fee driven  it s partnership driven and you ve got to find the right combination of incentives to make that work  So it s not always easy to do that  And I ll let Matt if you want to add Matthew Nicholls    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  just got a couple of other points on Benefit Street  first of all  in terms of their revenue contribution for the quarter it was up 8  from last quarter to  53 million that was largely due to performance fees but still its increased contribution  I think the second thing is  the team of Benefit Street is providing tremendous leverage for us at Franklin in terms of our overall strategy for alternative asset managers  They re all very experienced spending time with the other asset classes with the new alternative arena  including frankly spending time considering smaller specialized acquisition targets in that area  both domestically in the US and internationally  So we get    there s multiple other benefits to owning Benefit Street away from just the organic sort of activity that we have going on which we are enthusiastic about for the future Glenn Schorr    Evercore    AnalystAlright  Thanks so much Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Glenn OperatorThank you  Our final question today is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank  Your line is now live Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking my follow up  My question on the ETF inorganic trade was already answered  but maybe if I could just add a couple of things  Maybe your view on the active semi transparent ETFs  is that something that you think you would like to develop and leverage some of your better performing track records And then also I think you mentioned geographies  you d like to expand in  in terms of an M A strategy  Is that more distribution oriented or is it more product oriented Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOn the latter one  I ll start and Jenny would go the ETF one  On the latter one  it s a combination of both  depends on what market if it s more of the emerging markets  it s really distribution driven  In certain other local markets as you know  we have a local asset management business in several markets sometimes can be beyond distribution And in certain cases it s just  we have a very good operational group  if you will  based in certain of these countries and we can be much more scaled with the same amount of head count  So we re very focused on certain key countries and growing those countries  that s what we mean by that Jennifer M  Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd the non transparent ETF vehicles that have been approved  they re really US equity  So you are limited  And we certainly talk about it  and at the point where we feel that a particular product requires non transparent  we will absolutely entertain it  as I mentioned in rolling out these three thematic funds  we felt comfortable that we didn t need non transparent on those  And in the fixed income ones that we ve rolled out  So far we haven t felt the need for it  but it is not something that we are adverse to if it makes sense for particular product Glenn Schorr    Evercore    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  That concludes our question and answer session  I will turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments Gregory E  Johnson    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you everyone for attending our call and

192419,413935,BEN,U S  top court turns away dispute involving Iran s Bank Melli,news,By Andrew Chung WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up Iranian government owned Bank Melli s appeal of a lower court ruling that allowed victims of militant attacks allegedly backed by Iran to seek millions of dollars in compensation from the bank  The justices left in place the lower court s ruling that allowed some plaintiffs  trying to satisfy part of nearly  1 billion in court judgments against Iran  to go after roughly  17 6 million that  Visa Inc   NYSE V  and Franklin Resources Inc  NYSE BEN  owed to Bank Melli related to credit card use in Iran  This marked the second time in two weeks the justices have acted in a case in which Iran has refused to pay judgments won in American courts by U S  plaintiffs who have accused Tehran of complicity in various militant attacks  The high court on Feb  21 rejected a bid by another set of plaintiffs to seize priceless Persian artifacts held at a Chicago museum to satisfy a separate  71 5 million court judgment against Iran   Both disputes center on the reach of a 1976 federal law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that largely shields foreign governments from liability in American courts  except for countries like Iran that have been designated by the U S  government as state sponsors of terrorism  In the case in which the court acted on Monday  about 90 plaintiffs in four lawsuits won nearly  1 billion in court judgments against Iran for its alleged complicity in various attacks between 1990 and 2002  The plaintiffs include people injured or relatives of people killed in attacks including the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers residence at a U S  military base in Saudi Arabia  the 1990 killing of militant U S  born rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City  and two bombings in Jerusalem in 2001 and 2002  Bank Melli appealed to the Supreme Court  arguing that the  17 6 million  funds frozen due to U S  sanctions against Iran  cannot be seized because the bank does not actually own it  Rather  it is owed to the bank by Visa and Franklin   The San Francisco based 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that Bank Melli had no immunity because a 2002 law known as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act allows victims to access certain frozen assets of a country designated as a terrorism sponsor or one of its banks   The 9th Circuit also said the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act included a right for victims of militant attacks to collect on judgments regardless of commercial activity or other exemptions  The Supreme Court effectively overruled that finding in its Feb  21 decision ,2018-03-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-top-court-turns-away-dispute-involving-irans-bank-melli-1325386,1325386

192439,413955,BEN,Fed hike  inflation risk underestimated  Templeton s Hasenstab,news,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  Treasuries are not as safe as investors assume  fund manager Michael Hasenstab said on Monday  as full employment and rising inflation put pressure on central bankers to raise rates 
The U S  Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy as inflation rises to 3 percent this year and oil prices stabilize  according to Hasenstab  chief investment officer of Templeton Global Macro  who spoke at the Morningstar Inc Investment Conference in Chicago 
Such a move would be a catalyst for a rise in the U S  dollar and declines in the euro and yen currencies  already under pressure from domestic policies and potential British exit from the European Union 
 I don t think the market is priced for this   he said of the risks 
Hasenstab  a top portfolio manager of several Franklin Templeton Investments bond funds known for placing big bets in places like Ireland and Ukraine  has already seen his portfolios hurt in recent months while betting against the Japanese yen 
Despite efforts by the Bank of Japan to make exports more attractive  the safe haven yen has gained 12 percent this year

Hasenstab showed no sign of backing down as he offered a view of how his contrarian investments could prosper over the next five years 
 We would not refer to it as gambling   Hasenstab tartly responded to a question on the currency bets  citing his two decade long record as an investor   In order to protect capital we do have to take risk so we go out there and we look for what are the mispriced assets  
He said the yen rose as the Japanese central bank s policy of keeping rates low failed to weaken the currency in the face of U S  stimulus measures  The yen cannot continue to rise as the Bank of Japan policymakers  debase  the value of their currency and as the Fed raises rates  he added  Rising rates would also shrink U S  government bond values 
Hasenstab said he saw opportunity in Brazil  where he made a significant bet late last year  despite its  worst economic crisis  since the 1980s  But  we can see an exit   he said  because the country s debt levels were  quite manageable

192441,413957,BEN,Access denied and insults  U S  mutual funds get taste of activist life,news,By Michael Flaherty NEW YORK Reuters    Tensions between Ultratech  Inc and one of its largest shareholders got so high that by the spring  the chief executive was calling the investor a  cockroach  and refusing to meet with him  The target of the CEO s ire was not a brash activist investor seeking a quick shake up but Benjamin Nahum  a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman  the mutual fund company that had held stock of the tech industry supplier for over a decade  Neuberger Berman  along with Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN   Artisan Partners and several other large mutual fund firms are part of a growing band of traditional U S  money managers that are taking a page out of the activist investor playbook by publicly agitating for change at companies they believe can perform better   In the past  so called active fund managers that aim to pick the best stock and bond performers rather than passively follow an index  would have voiced concerns to CEOs in private  if they chose to speak up at all  Public agitation has normally been the realm of activist hedge funds and a cadre of smaller funds  By voicing frustrations for all to see  large active fund managers open the door even further for other major shareholders to join the public fight and add pressure on CEOs and boards to address the proposed strategy shifts  leadership shuffles and other changes  T  Rowe Price  historically the most outspoken of the big active managers  is currently pushing  Oracle Corp   NYSE ORCL  to improve its  9 3 billion offer for cloud storage company NetSuite Inc  which expires on Friday  The fund  which manages  763 billion  has sent a detailed letter to each company and has said it will not tender its shares   The mutual funds  public efforts to wring more value out of their holdings is in part a response to the rising competition from the low fee index tracking funds   You just can t follow the herd anymore  The idea of active means defending and enhancing your investment   said Nahum  the Neuberger portfolio manager  The more aggressive approach seems to be working for T  Rowe Price  Franklin Resources and Neuberger Berman  Active equity funds of the first two have outperformed their active and passive peers this year  while Neuberger was just behind its rivals  according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper  Graphic     Shares of Ultratech have risen 35 percent since August 2015 when Nahum sent a private letter to CEO Arthur Zafiropoulo and his management team  which kicked off the fight over the company s stock performance and its executive compensation plan  filings show   In April of this year  Neuberger  which oversees  255 billion in assets  informed the company it was nominating two board candidates  The fight was on  A Zafiropoulo representative later met with Nahum to tell him that the CEO thought the portfolio manager was a  cockroach  who was disrupting the company and should back off  according to people familiar with the matter  Shareholders voted Neuberger s nominees onto the board at the July annual meeting  Ultratech declined to comment on Neuberger Berman s campaign and was unable to make Zafiropoulo available to comment on what transpired publicly or privately between him and the fund  OUTFLOW Investors have been moving away from active fund managers to index tracking funds that charge about eight times less than the active funds and yet have outperformed them by 149 basis points over the past five years  according to Thomson Reuters Lipper   Speaking up in public risks alienating CEOs and their teams  but private dialogue  which mutual fund managers have preferred in the past  is easier to ignore than public protests  Forced to compete both against their peers and passive investors  active funds are more willing to put their access to management on the line  according to Bruce Goldfarb  the founder of proxy advisory firm Okapi Partners    We re seeing more cases where active managers are putting their mouth where their money is   Goldfarb said  Franklin Resources  with assets of  771 billion  is a case in point  In its September profile of activist investors  investment bank Lazard described Franklin as increasingly willing to take its discussions public  The fund pushed chemicals firm Axiall Corp to review its strategic options  which ultimately led to the company s  2 3 billion sale in June of this year to fellow chemical company Westlake Chemical Corp  It also struck a deal with drug maker BioPharmX Inc in August  which resulted in an independent director being added to the board  Franklin declined to comment  T  Rowe Price sent a detailed letter to NetSuite in Sept  opposing the offer price and the acquisition process  T  Rowe  NetSuite s second largest shareholder behind Oracle founder Larry Ellison  sent another letter to Oracle last week suggesting the company bump its offer to  133 per share from  109  The companies disclosed both letters  T  Rowe said in its latest letter that NetSuite is refusing to meet with the fund  Oracle  which declined to comment for this story  has said it won t raise its offer  NetSuite  whose shares closed at  94 on Thursday  did not return messages seeking comment   Our one and only motivation in taking a stance like this is to meet our fiduciary responsibility to our clients   said T  Rowe Spokesman Edward Giltenan  adding that the fund interacted with management teams mostly in private   We do consider taking a public stance when we deem it necessary to protect the interests of our clients

192493,414009,BEN,Franklin Resources  BEN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This investment manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 43 billion  up 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 45  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Franklin Resources 
For Franklin Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 25  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Franklin Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Franklin Resources would post earnings of  0 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering a surprise of  6 15  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Franklin Resources doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/franklin-resources-ben-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200500677,200500677

Franklin Resources  which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry  posted revenues of  1 41 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 52   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 41 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Franklin Resources shares have lost about 4 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Franklin Resources 
While Franklin Resources has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Franklin Resources was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

192496,414012,BEN,3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks  A Smarter Way To Boost Your Retirement Income   February 10  2020,opinion,"Strange but true  seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement 
Also  retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned  since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses  Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living  pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies 
The tried   and   true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn t work today 
Years ago  investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent  solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6 50   but unfortunately  those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over 
While this yield reduction may not seem drastic  it adds up  for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries  the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than  1 million 
And lower bond yields aren t the only potential problem seniors are facing  Today s retirees aren t feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security  either  Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future  but based on current estimates  Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035 
So what can retirees do  You could dramatically reduce your expenses  and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don t diminish  On the other hand  you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady  higher rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
We feel that these dividend paying equities   as long as they are from high quality  low risk issuers   can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low yielding Treasury bonds  or other bonds  
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
Going beyond those familiar names  you can find excellent dividend paying stocks by following a few guidelines  Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3   with positive annual dividend growth  The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 27 per share  with a dividend yield of 4 22   This compares to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 28  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 78   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 08 is up 3 85  from last year 
Costamare  CMRE  is paying out a dividend of 0 1 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 5 14  compared to the Transportation   Shipping industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 4 is flat compared to last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 64 per share  Edison International  NYSE EIX  has a dividend yield of 3 31   This is compared to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 2 69  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 55 is up 4 08  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
Yes  that s true  As a broad category  bonds carry less risk than stocks  However  the stocks we are talking about   dividend  paying stocks from high quality companies   can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole 
An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies  particularly blue chip stocks  raise their dividends over time  helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks  you can still pursue a dividend income strategy  However  it s important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF  which can ultimately reduce your dividend income  working against your strategy  Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

192501,414017,BEN,Is Franklin Resources  BEN  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Franklin Resources  Inc    NYSE BEN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Franklin Resources has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 71  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 54  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Franklin Resources s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 56 over the past five years The stock s PE compares favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 58  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile Franklin Resources has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 56  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Franklin Resources has a P S ratio of 2 33  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 38x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Franklin Resources currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Franklin Resources a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Franklin Resources might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives BEN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  While the current quarter estimate has seen no upward and three downward movements  the current year estimate has seen no upward and five downward movement over the past two months This has had a negative effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus has dropped 4 3  over the past two months  the current year estimate has plunged 6 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Franklin Resources  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFranklin Resources is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Besides a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 43  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  industry rank  past industry performance and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Franklin Resources 
For Franklin Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Franklin Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Franklin Resources would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 65  delivering a surprise of  3 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

192542,414058,BEN,BEN Vs  FII  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Financial   Investment Management sector might want to consider either Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN  or Federated Investors  FII   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Franklin Resources has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Federated Investors has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that BEN is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
BEN currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 68  while FII has a forward P E of 13 77  We also note that BEN has a PEG ratio of 1 95  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  FII currently has a PEG ratio of 2 01 
Another notable valuation metric for BEN is its P B ratio of 1 70  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FII has a P B of 3 73 
Based on these metrics and many more  BEN holds a Value grade of A  while FII has a Value grade of C 
BEN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that BEN is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ben-vs-fii-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200437049,200437049
192551,414067,BEN,Should Value Investors Pick Franklin Resources  BEN  Stock  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Franklin Resources Inc    NYSE BEN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Franklin Resources has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 89  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 88  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Franklin Resources  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 14 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 12  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Franklin Resources has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 98  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Franklin Resources has a P S ratio of about 2 83  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Franklin Resources currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Franklin Resources a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Franklin Resources might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F  This gives BEN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and none down in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 6 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 3 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Franklin Resources  Inc  Price and Consensus   Apart from this mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFranklin Resources is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 35  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

192570,414086,BEN,Is Franklin Resources  BEN  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company to watch right now is Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN   BEN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  and an A for Value 
Finally  we should also recognize that BEN has a P CF ratio of 9 98  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  BEN s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 12 40  Within the past 12 months  BEN s P CF has been as high as 22 09 and as low as 8 34  with a median of 17 29 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Franklin Resources s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that BEN is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-05-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-franklin-resources-ben-stock-undervalued-right-now-200424384,200424384
192584,414100,BEN,Earnings Preview  Franklin Resources  BEN  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This investment manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 41 billion  down 12 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Franklin Resources 
For Franklin Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Franklin Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Franklin Resources would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 54  delivering a surprise of  15 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Franklin Resources doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-franklin-resources-ben-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200408787,200408787

Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s check how it performed in past quarters 
Franklin pulled off positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters and posted in line results one 
However  in the last reported quarter  the company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Lower revenues and reduced assets under management  AUM  were recorded  Net outflows were also an undermining factor  However  controlled expenses were reflected in the quarter 
Franklin Resources  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not show that Franklin is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That s because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earnings ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00

Activities of the company in the fiscal second quarter were adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 64 cents were revised upward over the last seven days  However  it indicates a fall of 18  from the year ago reported figure 
Factors to Influence Q2 Results
Strong Markets to Lend Support  Performance of equity markets remained impressive during the fiscal second quarter  with the S P 500 Index gaining nearly 13  sequentially  This is anticipated to support the California based asset manager s AUM growth 
Higher AUM  Per the Franklin s monthly metrics disclosure  its AUM as of Mar 31  2019  was  712 3 billion  up 9 6  from Dec 31  2018 level on positive equity and fixed income market returns  Further  positive impact of the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners will also be reflected in the quarter s results 
Revenues to Disappoint  Investment management fees  which mark a significant portion of the company s revenues  might reflect a dip in the to be reported quarter  The consensus estimate for investment management fees of  960 million indicates nearly 14  decline from the year ago reported figure  Furthermore  sales and distribution fees are projected to be down 16  to  344 million 
Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  1 41 billion indicates a fall of 12 9  
Expenses Might Rise  Franklin s investments in information systems and technology  rise in general  administrative and other expenses  which experience seasonality to some extent  are likely to impact results 
Stocks That Warrant a Look

192592,414108,BEN,5 High Yielding Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Season,opinion,The first quarter earnings season is about to gather steam  with several major banks expected to release their results tomorrow  However  expectations for first quarter 2019 earnings are far from encouraging at present  Concerns about a global economic slowdown  intensifying tariff conflicts and various geopolitical issues have worsened the situation Disappointing Expectation from First Quarter EarningsInvestors are cautious owing to a widespread notion that first quarter earnings will decline year over year for the first time since the second quarter of 2016  Total earnings of the S P 500 Index are anticipated to be down 4  from the same period last year Meanwhile  revenues are expected to rise 4 6   Broad based margin pressure across all major sectors is the primary reason for an expected earnings decline  The last time this type of situation occurred  positive revenues but negative earnings  was in the third quarter of 2008 Concerns Regarding Global Economic Slowdown   On Apr 9  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  reduced global economic growth forecasts for 2019  This was the third reduction in the last six months  The new growth projection is 3 3  compared with 3 5  projected in January and 3 7  forecast in October The projection for U S  economic growth was reduced to 2 3  from 2 5   Notably  on Mar 20  the Fed lowered the U S  GDP growth rate to 2 1  in 2019 from 2 3  projected in December The IMF cited trade related conflict  likelihood of a tighter monetary policy by central banks  especially the Fed  appreciation of U S  dollar prices and geopolitical concerns such as Brexit and middle east problems as near term challenges Trade Tensions ReigniteOn Apr 8  the U S  Trade Representative proposed to levy tariffs worth of  11 billion on an array of Eurozone products including large commercial aircraft and parts  dairy products and wine  This is a retaliatory measure to what the Trump administration believes are illegal subsidies that the Eurozone countries provide to Airbus  This will impact sales of U S  made aircraft  However  the European Union has strongly objected to White House and threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs The newly formed trade and tariff agreement called United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  that replaced the old North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   is facing hurdles to be cleared by the U S  Congress  Majority House Democrats and a key Senate Republican have expressed concerns over the deal Finally  the year long trade conflict between the United States and China is yet to be resolved  Notably  China  Canada and Mexico together constitute 46  of U S  foreign trade Geopolitical IssuesThe Brexit doldrums are still continuing  The British parliament  which rejected prime minister Theresa May s Brexit deal  has failed to reach to a consensus despite voting twice  On Apr 10  European Union and the U K  government agreed to extend the Brexit deadline till Oct 31  Prolonged Brexit drama took a severe toll on the U K  economy  Consumer confidence weakened significantly and business establishments have almost frozen capital spending On Apr 8  President Trump designated Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps  a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  The designation will worsen the already sour relationship between the two countries after the United States imposed oil sanction on Iran in November 2018 Meanwhile  a full scale civil war has started in Libya and U S  military has decided to pull out a small contingent of American forces from that country  Breakout of civil war will severely disrupt global oil supply in the near future Our Top

192602,414118,BEN,Why Franklin Resources  BEN  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN   which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This investment manager has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 38  
For the most recent quarter  Franklin Resources was expected to post earnings of  0 74 per share  but it reported  0 79 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 76   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 75 per share  while it actually produced  0 75 per share  a surprise of 0  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Franklin Resources  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Franklin Resources has an Earnings ESP of  0 23  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-franklin-resources-ben-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200372962,200372962
192603,414119,BEN,Earnings Preview  Franklin Resources  BEN  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This investment manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 43 billion  down 11 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9 88  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Franklin Resources 
For Franklin Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Franklin Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Franklin Resources would post earnings of  0 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  6 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Franklin Resources doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-franklin-resources-ben-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200378467,200378467
192607,414123,BEN,WF Vs  BEN  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Financial   Investment Management stocks have likely encountered both Woori Bank  WF  and Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Woori Bank has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Franklin Resources has a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that WF is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
WF currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 08  while BEN has a forward P E of 10 88  We also note that WF has a PEG ratio of 0 85  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  BEN currently has a PEG ratio of 1 09 
Another notable valuation metric for WF is its P B ratio of 0 48  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BEN has a P B of 1 63 
Based on these metrics and many more  WF holds a Value grade of B  while BEN has a Value grade of C 
WF is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that WF is likely the superior value option right now ",2018-11-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wf-vs-ben-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200360018,200360018
192617,414133,BEN,Franklin Resources Inks Deal To Acquire FinTech Startup,opinion,"Franklin Resources   NYSE BEN   entered into an agreement with a San Francisco based  FinTech startup   Random Forest Capital  LLC  Though the financial terms of transaction were not disclosed  Franklin disclosed that the acquired firm s employees would be joining Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group investment s team 
Founded in 2016  Random Forest Capital applies machine learning and statistical algorithms for analyzing gains in financial investments  Per the website  the company utilizes machine learning methods which apply successfully to real life applications from medical diagnoses to sports analysis 
Moreover  it has a cloud infrastructure that enables the team to take a large amount of unstructured data for analyzing and finding investment opportunities

Per Jenny Johnson  president and COO of Franklin Templeton Investments  We continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions in emerging investment related technologies to augment and support Franklin Templeton s global offerings  
Further  Chris Molumphy  CIO of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group added that  The advanced pace of technological disruption is impacting the traditional investment landscape  providing new ways to identify and originate investment opportunities that generate value for investors  As a creative group of entrepreneurs  the Random Forest team brings an expanded tool set that enables us to further enhance our investment expertise and adapt to the ever changing investment landscape

Franklin s distribution platform will be further bolstered by the current deal  Moreover  these buyouts would greatly diversify product offerings  The company s cost control measures continue to support bottom line growth  However  declining investment management fees remains a concern for the company  Further  strict regulatory environment is a headwind

192650,414166,BEN,Why WisdomTree  WETF  Might Disappoint In Q2 Earnings,opinion,"WisdomTree Investments  Inc    NASDAQ WETF   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 28  before the market opens  Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year Last quarter  this New York based exchange traded fund and exchange traded product sponsor reported adjusted earnings per share of 5 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  The company witnessed significant increase in other income  However  the positives were partially offset by lower assets under management  AUM  and higher expenses WisdomTree has a disappointing earnings surprise history  It lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 21 9  
WisdomTree Investments  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model  we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for WisdomTree in the upcoming results  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better for this to happen  which is not the case here as elaborated below 
 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for WisdomTree is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents Zacks Rank  WisdomTree s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat Factors at Play
In 2016 and first quarter 2017 WisdomTree was hit by significant outflows  The outflows were mostly due to internationally hedged products  particularly the company s major currency hedged funds   HEDJ and DXJ   which constitute a major part of the company s AUM 
In the second quarter  there was no measurable progress that can help the company reduce outflows    WisdomTree remains focused on executing strategic growth initiatives  including expansion of distribution capabilities  investment in technology  launch of innovative products and addition of personnel  We expect such initiatives to increase marketing and sales expenses in the second quarter 
A key area to watch is the compensation expense level during the quarter  Management expects compensation expenses to be 28 31  of revenues for the year 
WisdomTree s activities during the to be reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable over the last seven days

This Week   Using Discipline When Entering and Exiting Trades
To frame this week s discussion  here is quote about using stops to exit your trades from a recent edition of Charles Kirk s   
 I do not adjust my stops after they are set  especially not on the fly based on some outside risk event  I don t like that kind of approach because it introduces a discretionary element into your risk management  At the end of the day  it isn t up to me to decide whether the market is wrong or right  After all  the market is always right  The stop is there to protect my capital when the position is wrong  
For some additional perspective on trading strategies  Valeriy Zakamulin adds a little order to the chaos in the field of market timing with moving averages in this article from Alpha Architect 

Further still  Alpha Architect provides more insightful information in this article 

Specifically  the article defines the concept of  volatility premium  and then goes on to describe several ways to capture that premium when you enter your trades 
Expert Picks from the Models
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by our frequent guest    also known as Mark D  Hines   Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas focused on value and income opportunities 
Homes  This week I like Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN   This stock s dip over the last month is the sort of set up I like to see  From the chart below you can see BEN is below its 50 day moving average  and just above its 200 day moving average  It s also received support at  42 twice now  and the price has moved up this week  With limited downside and plenty of upside potential  I hope I ve brought the humans a solid pick 

Blue Harbinger  BEN is an interesting business Holmes  It s largely an active asset manager targeting mainly retail investors  as well as some institutions  Asset managers make money based on the amount of assets under management   AUM   they have  i e  their fees are often a percent of AUM   So when the market goes up  BEN s revenues go up  The trouble with Franklin Resources is that there is this huge and continuing wave of assets moving away from active funds and into passive funds  this is NOT good for BEN 
Holmes  That a nice story about Franklin Resources  Blue Harbinger  But my style is dip buying mean reversion  my average holding period is six weeks  I exit when my price target is achieved  and I control risks based on macro factors and stops 
BH  Well Franklin Resources delivered slightly disappointing earnings on July 28th  and that s why the shares have sold off  The company s AUM was up  2 8 billion during the quarter  Specifically  AUM was up  10 1 billion due to net market change  but then lost  7 3 billion in net outflows you know  investors moving their money elsewhere  Holmes  have you considered a nice passive manager  like BlackRock  BLK    their assets under management will continue to benefit from investors moving to low cost passive funds like the iShares they offer 
Holmes  I could counter your argument by pointing out active managers  including Franklin Resources  have been increasingly beating their benchmarks this year  and also that the retail mutual funds business has an enormous contingent of relationship driven clients that will never go to the cold  bare bones  solutions offered by BlackRock  But instead  I ll just remind you that my edge is based on quantifiable mean reversion and dip buying  and I ll stick to that  How about you RoadRunner  what do you like this week 
RoadRunner  My most recent pick is RH  formerly Restoration Hardware   RH   I look for stocks that are at the bottom of a rising trading channel  and if you look at the chart below you can see why I like RH  It s been in a steady rising channel for months and may easily rise over  75 soon  I get in at opportune times  but only hold my position for so long usually about four weeks 

Blue Harbinger  RoadRunner  might I remind you that you have picked RH in the past  on both July 28th and on May 19th  Is there any particular reason you keep bringing RH to our attention 
RR  Well aside from the reasons I just told you  it s at the bottom of a rising channel  and it looks good for the next four weeks  my quantitative system has a profitable track record of getting in and out of these names at the right time 
BH  Ok RoadRunner  then I m just going to remind you of some of the things I pointed out last time you recommended  First  I don t like RH  It s a luxury home furnishings company that just completed an extraordinarily aggressive share buyback program  Specifically  they bought back nearly 50  of the shares outstanding in less than six months  and that drove the price to more than double  and it caused the price to earnings ratio to also increase dramatically 
The company s actions just seem very aggressive to me  especially considering they used some expensive debt to buy back the shares  And the market also believes there s something odd going on here considering short interest is still over 50   I just feel like this company could tank under even the slightest recession 
RR  Feelings are important  but not when it comes to my disciplined and repeatable process  RH is attractive  Anyway  how about you Felix what have you got 
Felix  I like Yelp  YELP   This stock has some powerful momentum on its side 

BH  Interesting pick  Felix  It s nice to see you finally bring an idea to the table after you had nothing for us last week 
Felix  Unlike you humans  I don t get frustrated and try to force things when the opportunities simply aren t there  On average  I hold my positions for 66 weeks  I ll exit when my price target is achieved  and I use stops to manage risks 
BH  Yelp is interesting because revenues are growing rapidly  but so too are SG A expenses  Your 66 week average holding period seems a little long compared to the rest of the gang  but I suppose that will give Yelp time to keep growing its business 
Yelp is basically an online platform to help people find highly regarded local businesses  It s got a huge addressable market  so if it keeps growing revenues  and it finds a way to control costs  eventually it won t have to spend so heavily on SG A expenses   Yelp could turn into a highly profitable cash cow 
Felix  That s an interesting story  However  I m just here to pick winners 
BH  That s why we like you Felix  Do you have an updated rankings list for us 
Felix  Yep  Here you go 


Conclusion
The trading process can often appear chaotic  especially if you are a newcomer to the field  However  there are methods behind the madness in determining when to enter and exit positions  For example  there are disciplined quantitative processes behind the selections of Felix  RoadRunner and Holmes  as well as Athena and Oscar   Further still  there are disciplined risk controls and exit methodologies in place  And having a disciplined process for entry and exit points is often what separates the most successful traders from the rest of the pack

Uncertainties surrounding the implementation of Trump policies and an improving interest rate environment led to a decent trading activity  particularly in the fixed income markets  This might have boosted average asset under management levels for most of the investment managers

192745,414261,BEN,Janus Capital  JNS  Stock Up Despite Earnings Miss In Q2,opinion,"Janus Capital Group  Inc   recorded a negative earnings surprise of 4 55  in second quarter 2016  The company reported earnings per share attributable to common shareholders of 21 cents  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Moreover  results fell below the prior year quarter figure of 23 cents 
	Though the company missed the earnings estimate  investors have taken the results as a positive on upward movement in assets under management  AUM   Therefore  shares spiked around 1  following the second quarter results 
	Lower than expected results reflect the reduction in revenues  However  the decline in operating expenses is a consequence of prudent expense management  Moreover  increase in AUM was another optimistic point 







Revenue Falls  Effective Cost Control Reflected
	Total revenue decreased 7 4  year over year to  251 9 million in the quarter  primarily on the back of lower investment management and higher negative performance fees  Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  254 million 
	Total operating expenses decreased 3 1  on a year over year basis to  184 million in the quarter  The decrease was a result of a fall in almost all categories of expenses  partially offset by a rise in depreciation and amortization  marketing and advertising along with general  administrative and occupancy expenses Strong Asset Position
	Average AUM decreased to  189 3 billion from  193 billion in the year ago quarter and from  180 2 billion in the preceding quarter 
	As of Jun 30  2016  Janus Capital reported total AUM of  194 7 billion  up from  191 3 billion as of Mar 31  2016 and  189 5 billion as of Jun 30  2015 
	Notably  the reported quarter witnessed a sequential increase in complex wide assets  exhibiting net market appreciation of  3 1 billion and exchange traded product net inflows of  0 3 billion  Fundamental equity and fixed income long term net inflows summed  0 3 billion and  0 4 billion  respectively  mitigated by Mathematical equity long term net outflows of  0 7 billion Stable Balance Sheet
	As of Jun 30  2016  Janus Capital had stockholders  equity of  1 7 billion  cash and investments of  653 6 million and outstanding debt of  404 2 million compared with stockholders  equity of  1 7 billion  cash and investments of  608 4 million and outstanding debt of  403 3 million at the end of the prior quarter 
	Cash flow from operations in the reported quarter was negative  104 3 million compared with  87 3 million in the second quarter 2015 Capital Deployment Activity
	During the second quarter  Janus Capital repurchased over 1 66 million shares of its common stock at an average price of  14 59 per share and a total cost of  24 2 million Our Viewpoint
	Janus Capital has the best in class investment boutique with potential for strong AUM and revenue improvement along with competitive leverage growth  Capital deployment activities of the company are also laudable  Moreover  the recent stake acquisition in Kapstream enhances Janus Capital s fixed income assets 
	Given its healthy balance sheet  we predict Janus Capital to perform well over the long haul while its equity heavy portfolio makes it vulnerable to the equity market  Further  lower revenues are a key concern

192747,414263,BEN,The Best and Worst Of The Financials Sector 3Q16,opinion,"The Financials sector ranks seventh out of the ten sectors as detailed in our  report    the Financials sector ranked sixth  It gets our Neutral rating  which is based on an aggregation of ratings of 38 ETFs and 235 mutual funds in the Financials sector as of July 12  2016 
Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  Not all Financials sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 22 to 565   This variation creates drastically different investment implications and  therefore  ratings 
Investors seeking exposure to the Financials sector should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2 
Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5

State Street SPDR S P Capital Markets  NYSE KCE   PowerShares KBW Property   Casualty Insurance  NYSE KBWP   and Oppenheimer Financials Sector Revenue  NYSE RWW  are excluded from Figure 1 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums

iShares US Financial Services ETF  NYSE IYG  is the top rated Financials ETF and Davis Financial Fund  DVFYX  is the top rated Financials mutual fund  Both earn a Very Attractive rating 
PowerShares KBW High Dividend Yield Financial Portfolio  NYSE KBWD  is the worst rated Financials ETF and Rydex Series Real Estate Fund  RYREX  is the worst rated Financials mutual fund  KBWD earns a Dangerous rating and RYREX earns a Very Dangerous rating 
587 stocks of the 3000  we cover are classified as Financials stocks 
Franklin Resources Inc   NYSE BEN   32 share  is one of our favorite stocks held by Financial ETFs and mutual funds and earns a Very Attractive rating  Since 2009 BEN has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 16  compounded annually  Franklin Resources has improved its return on invested capital  ROIC  from 15  in 2009 to a top quintile 26  over the last twelve months  Despite the fundamental strength  BEN is undervalued  At its current price of  32 share  BEN has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 7  This ratio means that the market expects BEN s NOPAT to permanently decline by 30   If BEN can grow NOPAT by 1  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  49 share today   a 53  upside 

American Campus Communities  NYSE ACC   52 share  is one of our least favorite stocks held by DAREX and earns a Very Dangerous rating  Over the past decade  ACC s economic earnings  its true cash flows  have declined from   13 million to   126 million  The company s ROIC has fallen from 5  in 2005 to a bottom quintile 2  over the last twelve months  Despite the clear destruction of shareholder value  ACC remains priced for significant profit growth  In order to justify its current price of  52 share  ACC must stop destroying shareholder value and grow NOPAT by 11  compounded annually for the next 13 years  This expectation seems rather optimistic given ACC s shareholder destruction over the past decade

192750,414266,BEN,Legg Mason s  LM  September AUM Declines,opinion,"Baltimore based Legg Mason Inc  s   NYSE LM   preliminary assets under management  AUM  of  732 9 billion as of Sep 30  2016 declined 1 2  from what it reported as of June 30 2016  This is because the company witnessed long term outflows of  1 4 billion in the month 
Outflows in fixed income  alternatives and equity were  0 8 billion   0 5 billion and  0 1 billion  respectively  Liquidity outflows amounted to  5 8 billion  However  there was positive foreign exchange impact of  1 1 billion 
Legg Mason s equity AUM increased 4 5  over the June number to  168 4 billion  Also  fixed income AUM increased 2 5  from the same period to  396 9 billion  However  alternative assets  including AUM managed by Clarion Partners  EnTrustPermal  RARE Infrastructure and Permal Capital Management  edged down around 0 8  to  72 0 billion 
The rise in equity and fixed income  partially offset by lower alternative AUM  resulted in long term AUM of  637 3 billion  This figure marked a 2 6  increase from the month of June  However  liquid assets  which are convertible into cash  plummeted around 21  to  95 6 billion 
Though foreign exchange fluctuations and absence of consistent growth in equity markets remain headwinds  we believe that Legg Mason has the potential to outperform its peers in the long run  The company s diversified product mix and leverage to the changing market demography are expected to drive growth

192791,414307,BEN,Franklin Resources  Rally May Come To End ,opinion,In this article  we revise our tentative pricing model for Franklin Resources  BEN  presented     The firm provides its services to individuals  institutions  pension plans  trusts  and partnerships  It manages  through its subsidiary  separate client focused equity  fixed income  and balanced portfolios   BEN is a financial company and we analyzed it three years ago as a candidate for    Unlike Lehman Brothers  Freddie Mac  Fannie Mae and many other financial companies  Franklin Resources has never been near the zero line of share price   In March 2012  our quantitative model  which foresaw the evolution at a five month horizon  signaled a negative correction to BEN s share price  We expected that the price would likely fall in the second quarter of 2012 and then would stay at  105 in 2012Q2  In February 2012  the monthly closing  adjusted for splits and dividends  price was at the level of  117 07  in March    123 44  and in April    124 91  all readings are sourced from Yahoo  Finance   After a large negative correction in May the price fell to  106 28 and was  110 in June  Therefore  the prediction was strikingly accurate in time and size  The revised model based on the monthly closing prices through October 2012 and consumer price indices available for the same period  shows a possibility of a further increase in the price at a four months horizon  The price is expected to rise to  134 in January 2012 with the current  Nov  23  level of  133 18  This means that BEN s price has reached its January s level and may stall at the current level  After a six month period of fast growth  from  106 to  133  and the above market return   20   the probability of the growth extension into 2013 cannot be high  One should not exclude that now is the best time to fix profit  We presume that any share price can be represented as a weighted sum of two consumer price indices  not seasonally adjusted in our model  which may be leading the share price by several months  Our  also includes a linear time trend and an intercept in order to remove mean and trend components from all involved time series  The intuition behind our pricing model is obvious   we link a given share to those goods and services which are produced provided by the company  In order to provide a dynamic reference we also introduce in the model some relative and independent level of prices  also expressed by CPIs   Hence  one needs two different CPIs to define the model  These CPIs we select from a big set of 92 CPIs by minimizing the residual model error  In March 2012  the tentative model was driven by the consumer price index of food at home  FH  leading the price by five months and the index of other goods and services  O  which led by nine months  In the revised model  the former index is replaced by the index of food without beverages  FB  which leads the share price by four months  Both food related indices are very close  as Figure 1 shows  The tentative and revised pricing models are as follows  BEN t     5 47FH t 5    1 81O t 9    59 55 t 2000    1327 36  February 2012  BEN t     7 33FB t 4    1 52O t 9    69 58 t 2000    1536 22  October 2012  where t is calendar time  The standard error between July 2003 and October 2012 is  7 36   7 55 in March   Figure 2 depicts the observed and predicted monthly closing prices since 2003 and also provides the high low monthly prices  which may serve as the estimates of uncertainty in the monthly price   One can model the monthly high or low price instead of the closing one   At a four month horizon  the price is expected to grow to the final level of  134  Figure 3 shows that BEN s price is currently very close to the predicted one ,2012-11-25,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/franklin-resources'-rally-may-come-to-end-144863,144863
