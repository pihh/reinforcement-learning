3984,225499,ECHO,U S  truck firms accelerate into the merging lane,news,"By Eric M  Johnson and Nick Carey
The consolidation of the U S  trucking industry is picking up speed  with big trucking companies and private equity funds scooping up smaller firms as a U S  regulatory mandate is set to go into effect and as drivers push for higher wages 
There have been 44 publicly announced freight movement and logistics deals within the U S  so far this year  according to Thomson Reuters data  already topping the 38 deals announced in 2016  And the total is likely much higher because most deals are private  said Todd McMahon  managing director at investment bank Capstone Partners 
Trucking companies by late December must start using electronic logging devices  known as ELDs  to track the number of hours drivers are behind the wheel 
The new mandate makes it harder for trucking firms to dodge federal limits on the hours drivers can work and will likely cut into productivity  trucking industry officials have said  That would pressure already razor thin margins at smaller trucking firms  fueling consolidation 
Executives at larger trucking companies and private equity firms have said they are aggressively hunting for deals 
And the trucking industry is recovering after a tough few years  making struggling firms more likely to sell  Dan Clark  transportation finance head at BMO Harris Bank  the largest U S  truck financing arm 
 XPO Logistics  Inc  N XPO  Chief Executive Officer Brad Jacobs said last week the company has a war chest of up to  8 billion for possible deals in the coming months  and has narrowed its target list to dozens of companies 
XPO has used rapid fire acquisitions to grow from a small truck brokerage into a diversified company  In a 2015 buying spree of roughly  6 5 billion  it snagged trucking and logistics firm Con way for  3 billion as well as France s Norbert Dentressangle for  3 53 billion 
Scott Wheeler  chief financial officer at Daseke Inc  O DSKE   which hauls industrial equipment for customers like  Caterpillar   N CAT  and Deere   Co  N DE  on flatbed and specialized trailers  said acquisitions will fuel the company s rapid growth  Daseke  with a market value of  597 million  has closed four deals in 2017 with more due before year end   There is so much opportunity   said Wheeler  whose finance team is evaluating numerous merger targets with well managed fleets and revenue of  40 million to  250 million  Daseke is the largest carrier in the  133 billion open deck and specialized trucking niche  yet still has less than one percent of this fragmented market 
In August  Green Bay  Wisconsin based  Schneider National Inc   N SNDR  told analysts the company plans to focus on  specialty areas  for acquisitions 
Echo Global Logistics  O ECHO   with a market value of  664 million  has an  active pipeline  of so called tuck in deals aimed at strengthening a particular division that they are working on  CEO Douglas Waggoner told investors 
Financial data provider Preqin said year to date North American fundraising for private equity funds that include logistics as part of a wider focus has hit  11 6 billion  compared to  7 5 billion for all of 2016  The top funds in that sector either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on their investment plans 
FLURRY OF ACTIVITY
The biggest deal so far this year was the merger of Swift Transportation Co  the sixth largest U S  trucking company  and  Knight Transportation Inc   N KNX   the 23rd largest  creating the biggest truckload operator in North America with a combined market value of more than  5 billion   L3N1HI3S9 
 The big are getting bigger and then  with Knight Swift  that s the big big getting huge   said Jeff Sass  senior vice president at truckmaker  Navistar International Corp   N NAV  
For a FACTBOX on major deals this year see 
Industry executives say the electronic log rules give big trucking companies who already use electronic logs a stronger hand in the market 
Companies like Schneider and Covenant Transportation Group Inc  O CVTI   which provides long haul services  have used electronic logs for years and backed the rule  But the mandate could sap productivity by 3 percent to 15 percent  according to industry estimates 
Trucking firms have also had to raise driver pay as they struggle to attract and retain drivers amid a general driver shortage and tight U S  labor markets  which has also pressured margins 
In addition  many owners of family owned truck firms that launched following industry deregulation  which reduced government controls on trucking rates and routes from 1980  have hit or are approaching retirement age with children pursuing different careers 
For many  their options are sell out  or shut down 
 It s  the pace of acquisitions  been as busy as we ve seen it since we started the business 13 years ago   said Jim Parham  managing partner Florida based M A advisory firm Transport Capital Partners 
 We expect this pace to continue  if not accelerate  in the coming months   Parham said 
Parham hopes to close four deals between firms with revenue of between  10 million to  250 million in the coming weeks but declined to provide specifics 
In February  Parham helped less than truckload carrier Central Freight Lines buy Wilson Trucking Corp out of Waco  Texas  another LTL carrier  to expand into the U S  Southeast  LTL carriers consolidate smaller freight loads onto a single truck 
QUALITY AN ISSUE
Some privately held carriers are focused on building out their own fleet rather than buying other firms 
Brad Pinchuk  CEO of Dubuque  Iowa based Hirschbach Motor Lines  said finding companies to buy that match his modern fleet and low annual driver turnover is tough  He has pursued aggressive expansion  nearly tripling his fleet since 2013 to around 1 100 trucks 
Pinchuk says the outlook for family owned truck firms is bleak because major customers want a handful of big suppliers 
 Our big customers are getting bigger and they are doing business with fewer transportation providers   Pinchuk said   That makes it pretty darn tough for a small guy to do business directly with a large shipper  
Certain niche  higher margin truckers may be targeted by private equity firms  said Capstone s McMahon 
For example  Magnate Worldwide  a joint venture between private equity firms CIVC Partners LP and Magnate Capital Partners  acquired New York based fine art shipper Masterpiece International in April for an undisclosed sum ",2017-11-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-truck-firms-accelerate-into-the-merging-lane-764365,764365

Week of Zacks Investment Research Valuable Low Price to Book Stocks for Solid ProfitsValue investors have preferred price to earnings ratio or P E for time immemorial as a means to identify value stocks  However  in case of loss making companies that have a negative price to earnings ratio  the price to sales or P S ratio is considered in determining their true value However  the price to book ratio  P B ratio   though used less often  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with great returns P B is the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityWhat is Book ValueThere are several ways to determine book value  Book value is the total value that would be left  according to a company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all of its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets of a company  In most cases  this would equate to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from total assets to determine the book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this

intangible assets should also be subtracted from total assets to determine the book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or

23605,245120,ECHO,Should Value Investors Consider Echo Global  ECHO  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Echo Global Logistics  Inc    NASDAQ ECHO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Echo Global has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 30  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 76  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Echo Global  current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint  which is 31 44  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 90  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Echo Global has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 31  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Echo Global s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Echo Global has a P S ratio of about 0 23  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 42 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Echo Global currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ECHO a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Echo Global is just 0 76  a level that is somewhat lower than the industry average of 2 00  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 78  which is slightly better than the industry average of 7 50  Clearly  ECHO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Echo Global might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F  This gives ECHO a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher and four lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate witnessed two upward and five downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 20  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen 3 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Echo Global Logistics  Inc  Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEcho Global is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 15  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment  estimates  broader factors and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

23711,245226,ECHO,Political Drama Raises Stake For Wall Street  Top 5 Picks ,opinion,Over the past several weeks  tensions with North Korea  China and Iran dragged the broader equity market down on several occasions  Now  mounting fears about political instability in Italy and Spain are ripping through markets Despite escalating geopolitical issues  small capitalization stocks stay fairly immune  This is because such stocks have high domestic exposure in terms of revenue generation  which shields them from the aftermath of international disputes  Thus  investing in sound small caps seems sensible at the moment Deepening Italian Crisis Political crisis in Italy has created ripples across the global equity markets  Investors fear that such a crisis in one of Europe s largest economies will wreak havoc worldwide  It s a constitutional crisis after president Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment of economy minister Paolo Savona who is known to have criticized the European Union and European integration Savona was recommended by a coalition of the populist 5 Star Movement and the League  Party leaders from 5 Star asked for Mattarella s impeachment  per the Wall Street Journal  Collapse of a populist coalition raised concerns that the country will be thrown into a mess early elections  while short term borrowing costs soared for the government in Rome Spain s Political Crisis Roils MarketsMarkets are also rattled by the political turmoil in Spain  In an effort to oust Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy  Spain s major opposition party has called for a parliamentary vote  This is because a court has ruled that the party in power benefitted from an illegal kickback when the country was undergoing a property boom Center left Socialist Party filed the confidence vote and it was supported by the far left Podemos  This has added to increasing political pressure that is weakening the premier s party  A court has already handed some former members of the premier s center right Popular Party jail sentences and asked them to pay millions of euros in fines due to their roles in the corruption scheme Tensions With North Korea Trump s decision to call off a June meeting with Kim Jong Un  by the way  appears to have done little to the North Korea crisis  Trump citied  open hostility  from the North Korean regime as the primary reason for scrapping plans for a summit with Jong Kim Kye Gwan  senior North Korea foreign ministry officials  harsh words with national security adviser John Bolton embittered the relationship between the adversaries  Nonetheless  Gwan did express his willingness to resolve disputes with the United States  Growing North Korea nuclear threats are cited to be the reason behind this hostility Withdrawing From Nuclear Treaty  Trade Tensions RemainTrump s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal hasn t gone down well with leaders in Europe as well  They have categorically expressed their distrust toward the United States  But  it s not the European anger that should bother America but the Middle East tensions  Saudi Arabia has inclined toward Israel in order to get sanctions against Iran  This has raised tensions between Iran and Israel  and peace in the Middle East seems like a far fetched idea But  why just the Middle East  Undercurrent trade tensions remain between the United States and China  And this has far reaching implications on economies around the world  Needless to say that it also affects corporate profits  Tensions surfaced after the countries began to make lists of products subject to tariffs  including aerospace items Small Caps to the Rescue  5 Solid PicksAs geopolitical risks loom large  investing in small cap stocks seems judicious  Due to their limited international exposure  small caps offer higher protection than their large  and mid cap counterparts against global downturns  The Russell 2000 index that mostly comprise small cap stocks is up 5 5  month to date and is just 0 6  shy of a record close notched on May 21 We have  thus  selected five small caps that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Turning

23793,245308,ECHO,Zacks com Highlights  Boise Cascade  Commercial Vehicle Group  Century Communities  Echo Global Logistics And Bunge,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 17  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Boise Cascade Company   NYSE BCC    Commercial Vehicle Group Inc    NASDAQ CVGI    Century Communities  Inc    NYSE CCS    Echo Global Logistics Inc    NASDAQ ECHO   and Bunge Ltd    NYSE BG   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks Shining on Recent Broker Rating UpgradesThe picture that has emerged from the Q1 earnings season is an extremely bright one  With only a handful of companies left to report  the season is expected to end on a high  displaying substantially higher earnings growth than witnessed in the recent quarters  Apart from significant year over year growth  a high proportion of companies have reported better than expected earnings per share Generally  an earnings beat leads to stock price appreciation  Given this favorable background  investors would like to add outperformers to their portfolios for healthy returns However  the task is easier said than done  especially for an individual investor  With a plethora of stocks flooding the market at a particular point of time  it is nearly impossible for an investor to go through the financials and other relevant details for each and every company before arriving at a decision  Buy  Sell or Hold   The time constraint that we all face these days makes the task even more difficult for individual investors This is where proper guidance is required  To prevent their hard earned money from going down the drain  investors often than not pay heed to the advice of brokers while designing their respective portfolios Why Paying Heed to Broker Advice is a Good PracticeThe opinion of brokers acts as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock  Broker ratings are backed by sound logic  They have deeper insight into the happenings of a particular company as they directly communicate with management They undertake extensive research on the company s publicly available financial statements apart from attending conference calls  In a bid to deepen their understanding of a particular stock  they sometimes converse with customers to find out their likes dislikes about the products and services offered by the company In view of their expertise  it is prudent for investors to pay heed to broker advice while formulating their investment strategy for generating handsome returns  Of the three types of brokers analysts  Sell side  Buy side and independent  present in the investment world  Sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Proper GuideAs mentioned above  brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage  Therefore  they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for a particular company  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock Naturally  when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock  they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario Framing a Successful Strategy The above write up clearly suggests that by following broker actions  one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks  Keeping this in mind  we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  making the strategy foolproof And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test
