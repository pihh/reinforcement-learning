What s the Momentum Style Score 
The Momentum Style Score theory states that what has been going up so far should continue to do so in the near future  This indicates the time to buy a stock that is likely to witness a rise in share price  Nothing is more frustrating than watching a fundamentally sound or inexpensive stock remain stagnant 
Momentum investors  thus  strongly believe  the trend is your friend   which implies that stocks which are growing will continue to grow  They make short term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend  The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized  it is likely to retain that direction and not move against the flow

Industrial Average  DJI  have gained 16 1   8 9  and 8 3   respectively year to date Among the various sectors  the performance of the technology sector was rather impressive  with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLK   returning 16 7  in the year to date period  Notably  the ETF gained 12 9  last year Launched in Dec 1998  XLK is a passively managed fund designed to deliver the returns of the U S  technology stocks  The fund  before expenses  is expected to remain on par with the returns and characteristics of the S P Technology Select Sector Index More Upside Left for Tech Stocks The technology sector is likely to grow further  as evident from the recent forecast on worldwide IT spending provided by Gartner Inc    NYSE IT    The latest report from the independent

favorite due to its dynamic nature  It is expected to grow faster than ever before as evident from Gartner s latest forecasts as well as improving U S  economic data Naturally  investing in the tech

concern  Only a few lucky ones would rake in the moolah  while others fall victim to ad hoc strategies So  wouldn t it be safer to bet on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further Here  we will discuss one tried and tested technique   picking stocks near their 52 week highs Why These Stocks are Good BetsInvesting in stocks near their 52 week high is akin to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the understanding that once a trend is established  it is likely to continue  The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects   Major developments may also send stocks soaring However  stocks that are trading near their 52 week highs bear the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued  But the positives seem to outweigh the drawbacks Notably  momentum investors strongly believe in  the trend is your friend   which means stocks that are growing will continue to grow  They make short term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend  The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized  it is likely to continue and the chances of a reversal are minimal Thus  picking such stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term  However  this is only a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted Where to Put Your Money Given their strong earnings history and great value metrics  we believe these six tech stocks  all of which are near their 52 week highs  will

The primary catalyst for extending this round of gains has been bullish results from Netflix  Shares of the streaming service provider jumped 13 5  after it added over 5 2 million subscribers during the second quarter  much more than the expected 3 2 million  Also  earnings grew 66 7  while revenues increased 32 3  on a year over year basis   Read   
Market watchers had backed tech stocks to bounce back  riding on a strong earnings performance  The sector s recent slide had begun on Jun 9  when a report from Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   triggered off several questions about gains made recently  It questioned the sky high valuation of tech stocks  particularly the likes of Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Microsoft   OTC MFST   and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   
Overvaluation concerns then triggered off a spate of losses for tech stocks  Ultimately  the Nasdaq closed the month of June 0 9  lower  This was the index s first monthly loss since the 2 3  decline in Oct 2016 
Solid First Half Performance  Strong Fundamentals
Despite the decline in June  the Nasdaq still managed to finish the second half 14 1  higher  Additionally  the index recorded its best performance for the same period since 2009  At that time  the Nasdaq had skyrocketed by 43 9  to post a far more spectacular performance  Even so  the index notched up 38 all time highs during the first half of this year 
This is the largest number of record finishes recorded since the same period in 1986  At that time it had ended at record levels on 52 occasions    
Tuesday s gains come at a time when the fate of President Trump s new healthcare law looks increasingly uncertain  In the event that it fails to gain passage  fresh questions will arise about the new administration s ability to deliver on the policy front 
It seems investors are ignoring these developments  choosing instead to focus on low interest rates inflation  a soft dollar and a resilient economy  Strong earnings performances of the likes of Netflix are likely to further bolster markets in the days ahead 
Our Choices
Investors seem to have recovered their confidence in tech stocks  choosing to ignore recent concerns about valuations  A strong earnings show  such as the one from Netflix has bolstered such sentiments  leading to fresh gains for the sector over the past few sessions 
Investing in tech stocks which make up the Nasdaq looks like an extremely prudent option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

Coherent  Inc  CEO s Comments

 We had another record setting result in our most recent quarter and demand remains buoyant  We booked a significant number of large format  i e   Gen 5 or Gen 6  ELA tools for OLED manufacturing  Utilization within OLED fabs is very high and with more installations moving into the service pool  ELA service orders and revenues continue to climb  The outlook for FPD is bright with multiple new fabs having been announced or in the late stages of planning  These new fabs will drive business predominantly in FY19 and beyond  We will be prepared to satisfy the delivery schedule since we have started our previously announced facility expansions  The overall materials processing business continues to perform well  Most notably  we had very good traction during Q3 for high power  i e   1 8 kilowatts  fiber lasers in battery welding for electric vehicles and metal cutting  The pipeline is strong and outstrips our current capacity  which necessitates expansions in our diode packaging and fiber laser integration and testing operations  The additional capacity will be staged over the next year   said John Ambroseo  Coherent s President and Chief Executive Officer   We had another quarter of strong cash flow and we made a voluntary  45 million principal prepayment on our debt  Using excess cash flow to pay down the debt will remain a priority   Ambroseo added  

COHR Technical Analysis

COHR opened trading yesterday at  269 40 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  265 00  COHR closed trading yesterday at  271 00 and spiked down after market to  234 00  equivalent to a 13  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time COHR traded below these levels we have to go back to July 6th when it traded at lows of  226 93 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down COHR had been in an overall upward trend dating back to January 23rd when it traded at  146 93  COHR has a of 24 4 million shares and traded 1 78 times the normal daily trading on Tuesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see COHR open trading on Wednesday below  246 00 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  1 50 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

7418,228933,COHR,7 Stocks Near 52 Week High That Can Scale Higher,opinion,The movement of stocks scaling 52 week highs or hitting lows is closely monitored on a daily basis  Now  the question is  how important such stock movements are to investors Betting on a stock near its 52 week high has its own pitfalls as there is a possibility of it scaling higher or going downhill without forewarning  One of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook  the 52 week strategy  relies on the mantra  buy high and sell higher A wide group of investors are placing their bets on stocks which are near their 52 week high mark but are still undervalued with strong upside potential  While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52 week high investment technique  many of them believe that 52 week high stocks  which are presently undervalued  can be lucrative bets An Insight Into 52 Week High StocksStocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period   According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52

24342,245857,COHR,7 Stocks With Recent Price Strength For Explosive Returns,opinion,An investor always seeks a win win strategy  but it is easier said than done  And when the market is as volatile as it is now  things become difficult for even an ardent investor One could take resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  But this also bears the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could be stuck in the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in a selected stock is not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing price increase  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers  So  looking at those stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have already set sounds rational However

current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage

24352,245867,COHR,7 Stocks Near 52 Week Highs To Buy Right Away,opinion,Stocks nearing a 52 week high make investors take a closer look at it for possibilities of a further rise  The truth is there is no crystal ball or time tested strategy that can help one determine the impending trend Though touted as one of the riskier investing techniques  a sizable number of investors are picking undervalued stocks near 52 week high with the conviction that they can scale higher Here at Zacks we will help you hitch a quick ride on the 52 week high bandwagon to earn some profits  Clubbing 52 week high stocks with the correct set of parameters is all you need to turn the tide in your favor Our screen will provide you with a clear investment strategy and help you minimize the risks associated with any ad hoc strategies Decoding the 52 Week High TrendStocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential  due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors  despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments start dominating the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period   According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months has resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies Selecting the Right ParametersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedThe lower  the better P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism

24456,245971,COHR,Valuation Based Equity Market Forecasts  Expensive And Overbought,opinion,We endorse the decisive evidence that markets and economies are complex  dynamic systems which are not reducible to normal cause effect analysis  However  we are willing to acknowledge the likelihood that the future is likely to rhyme with the past  Thus  we believe there is substantial value in applying simple statistical models to discover average estimates of what the future may hold over meaningful investment horizons  10  years   while acknowledging the wide range of possibilities that exist around these averages  To be crystal clear  the commentary below makes no assertions about whether markets will carry on higher from current levels  Expensive markets can get much more expensive in the intermediate term  and investors need look no further back than the late 2000s for just such an example  However  the physics of investing in expensive markets is that  at some point in the future  perhaps years from now  the market has a very high probability of trading back below current prices  perhaps far below  More importantly  investors must recognize that buying stocks at very expensive valuations will necessarily lead to future returns over the subsequent 10   20 years that are far below average  There are several reasons why it may be useful to have a more robust estimate of future expected returns on stocks  People who are approaching retirement need to estimate probable returns in order to budget how much they need to save A retiree s level of sustainable income is largely dictated by expected returns over the early years of retirement Investors of all types must make an informed decision about how best to allocate their capital among various investment opportunities Many studies have attempted to quantify the relationship between  and future stock returns  Shiller PE smoothes away the spikes and troughs in corporate earnings which occur as a result of the business cycle by averaging inflation adjusted earnings over rolling historical 10 year windows  This study contributes substantially to research on smoothed earnings and Shiller PE by adding three new valuation indicators  the   total market capitalization to GNP  and deviations from the long term price trends  The Q Ratio measures how expensive stocks are relative to the replacement value of corporate assets  Market capitalization to GNP accounts for the aggregate value of U S  publicly traded business as a porportion of the size of the economy  In 2001  Warren Buffett wrote an  where he states   The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know  Still  it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment   Lastly  deviations from the long term trend of the S P inflation adjusted price series indicate how  stretched  values are above or below their long term averages  These three measures take on further gravity when we consider that they are derived from four distinct facets of financial markets  Shiller PE focuses on the earnings statement  Q ratio focuses on the balance sheet  market cap to GNP focuses on corporate value as a proportion of the size of the economy  and deviation from price trend focuses on a technical price series  Taken together  they capture a wide swath of information about markets  We analyzed the power of each of these  valuation  measures to explain inflation adjusted stock returns including reinvested dividends over subsequent multi year periods  Our analysis provides compelling evidence that future returns will be lower when starting valuations are high  and that returns will be higher in periods where starting valuations are low  This last point may seem obvious  but I want to emphasize a critical point about traditional wealth management of which most investors are not aware  Many traditional investment advisors do not account for whether markets are cheap or expensive when determining investors  long term asset allocation  In our experience  an investor who visited a traditional Investment Advisor at the peak of the technology bubble in early 2000 would  in practice  have been advised to allocate the same proportion of his wealth to stocks as an investor who visited an Advisor near the bottom of the markets in early 2009  This despite the fact that the first investor would have had a valuation based expected return on his stock portfolio from January 2000 of negative 2  per year  while the second investor would expect inflation adjusted compound annual returns of 6 5   For an investor with  1 000 000 to invest  this would represent a difference of more than  1 26 million in cumulative wealth over a decade  Said differently  traditional wealth advice is rooted in the assumption that the best estimate of future returns is the average long term return to stocks  No matter where markets are on the continuum from very cheap to very expensive  traditional Advisors will make recommendations on the assumption that investors should expect 6 5  inflation adjusted returns on stocks over all investment horizons  John Hussman at Hussman funds is careful to qualify the value of this analysis   Rich valuation is strongly associated with weak subsequent returns  but only reliably so over periods of 7 10 years  In contrast  the present syndrome of overvalued  overbought  overbullish  rising yield conditions is typically associated with abrupt and often steep losses  but is more commonly resolved over a period of months rather than years    Hussman  Feb 2013   Thus  we are not making a forecast of market returns over the next several months  in fact  markets could go substantially higher from here  However  over the next 10 to 15 years  markets are very likely to revert to average valuations  which are much lower than current levels  This study will demonstrate that investors should expect 6 5  returns to stocks only during those very rare occasions when the stock market passes through  fair value  on its way to becoming very cheap  or very expensive  At all other periods  there is a better estimate of future returns than the long term average  and this study endeavours to quantify that estimate  Investors should be aware that  relative to meaningful historical precedents  markets are currently expensive and overbought by all three measures  indicating a strong likelihood of low inflation adjusted returns going forward over periods as long as 20 years  This forecast is also supported by evidence from an analysis of corporate profit margins  In a recent article  John Hussman published a long term chart of U S  corporate profits  which demonstrated the magnitude of upward distortion endemic in current corporate profits  which we have reproduced in Chart 1 below  Companies have clearly been benefitting from a period of extraordinary profitability  The profit margin picture is critically important  Jeremy Grantham recently stated   Profit margins are probably the most mean reverting series in finance  and if profit margins do not mean revert  then something has gone badly wrong with capitalism  If high profits do not attract competition  there is something wrong with the system and it is not functioning properly   On this basis  we can expect profit margins to begin to revert to more normalized ratios over coming months  If so  stocks may face a future where multiples to corporate earnings are contracting at the same time that the growth in earnings is also contracting  This double feedback mechanism may partially explain why our statistical model predicts such low real returns in coming years  Caveat Emptor  Modeling Across Many Horizons Many studies have been published on the Shiller PE  and how well  or not  it estimates future returns  Almost all of these studies apply a rolling 10 year window to earnings as advocated by Dr  Shiller  But is there something magical about a 10 year earnings smoothing factor  Further  is there anything magical about a 10 year forecast horizon  Kitces  2008  PDF format  demonstrated that  the safe withdrawal rate for a 30 year retirement period has shown a 0 91 correlation to the annualized real return of the portfolio over the first 15 years of the time period   So there is clearly merit in studying a 15 year forecast horizon as well  Further  the tables below will demonstrate that statistical models have the greatest explanatory power at the 15 year horizon  This study will attempt to address the question of  perfect forecast horizon   perfect valuation factor  and  perfect earnings smoothing factor   by analyzing the explanatory power of earnings  the Q Ratio  and regressed historical stock returns  over return horizons from 1 to 30 years  We will also put all of the factors together to construct an optimized model  Table 1  below provides a snapshot of some of the results from our analysis  The table shows estimated future returns based on a coherent aggregation of several factor models over some important investment horizons  Table 1  Factor Based Return Forecasts Over Important Investment Horizons  Source  Shiller  2013   DShort com  2013   Chris Turner  2013   World Exchange Forum  2013   Federal Reserve  2013   Butler Philbrick Gordillo   Associates  2013  You can see from the table that  according to a model that incorporates valuation estimates from 4 distinct domains  and which explains over 80  of historical returns since 1871  stocks are likely to deliver 1  or less in real total returns over the next 5 to 20 years  Yikes  Process The purpose of our analysis was to examine several methods of capturing market valuation to determine which methods were more or less efficacious  Furthermore  we were interested in how to best integrate our valuation metrics into a coherent statistical framework that would provide us with the best estimate of future returns   Our approach relies on a common statistical technique called linear regression  which takes as inputs the valuation metrics we calculate from a variety of sources  and determines how sensitive actual future returns are to contemporaneous observations of each metric  Linear regression creates a linear function  which by definition can be described by a slope value and an intercept value  which we provide below for each metric and each forecast horizon  A further advantage of linear regression is that we can measure how confident we can be in the estimate provided by the analysis  The quantity we use to measure confidence in the estimates is called the   The following matrices show the R Squared ratio  regression slope  regression intercept  and current forecast returns based on a regression analysis for each valuation factor  The matrices are heat mapped so that larger values are reddish  and small or negative values are blue ish  Click on each image for a large version  Matrix 1  Explanatory power of valuation future returns relationships  Matrix 1  contains a few important observations  Notably  over periods of 10 20 years  the Q ratio  very long term smoothed PE ratios  and market capitalization   GNP ratios are equally explanatory  with R Squared ratios around 55   The best estimate  perhaps tautologically given the derivation  is derived from the price residuals  which simply quantify how extended prices are above or below their long term trend  The worst estimates are those derived from trailing 12 month PE ratios  PE1 in Matrix 1 above   Many analysts quote  Trailing 12 Months  or TTM PE ratios for the market as a tool to assess whether markets are cheap or expensive  If you hear an analyst quoting the market s PE ratio  odds are they are referring to this TTM number  Our analysis slightly modifies this measure by averaging the PE over the prior 12 months rather than using trailing cumulative earnings through the current month  but this change does not substantially alter the results  As it turns out  TTM  or PE1  Price Earnings ratios offer the least information about subsequent returns relative to all of the other metrics in our sample  As a result  investors should be extremely skeptical of conclusions about market return prospects presented by analysts who justify their forecasts based on trailing 12 month ratios  Forecasting Expected Returns We expect you to be skeptical of our unconventional assertions  so below we provide the precise calculations we used to determine our estimates  The following matrices provide the slope and intercept coefficients for each regression  We have provided these in order to illustrate how we calculated the values for the final matrix below of predicted future returns to stocks  Matrix 2  Slope of regression line for each valuation factor time horizon pair  Matrix 3  Intercept of regression line for each valuation factor time horizon pair Matrix 4  shows forecast future real returns over each time horizon  as calculated from the slopes and intercepts above  by using the most recent values for each valuation metric  through February 2013   For statistical reasons which are beyond the scope of this study  when we solve for future returns based on current monthly data  we utilize the rank in the equation for each metric  not the nominal value For example  the 15 year return forecast based on the current Q Ratio can be calculated by multiplying the current ordinal rank of the Q Ratio  1171  by the slope from Matrix 2  at the intersection of  Q Ratio  and  15 Year Rtns    0 000086098   and then adding the intercept at the same intersection  0 119607  from Matrix 3  The result is 0 0188  or 1 88   as you can see in Matrix 4  below at the same intersection  Q Ratio   15 Year Rtns  Matrix 4  Modeled forecast future returns using current valuations  Finally  at the bottom of the above matrix we show the forecast returns over each future horizon based on our best fit multiple regression from the factors above  From the matrix  note that the best forecast for future real equity returns integrating all available valuation metrics is 1  or less per year over horizons covering the next 5 to 20 years  We also provided the R squared for each multiple regression underneath each forecast  you can see that at the 15 year forecast horizon  our regression explains 80  of total returns to stocks  Chart 2  below demonstrates how closely the model tracks actual future 15 year returns  The red line tracks the model s forecast annualized real total returns over subsequent 15 year periods using our best fit multiple regression model   The blue line shows the actual annualized real total returns over the same 15 year horizon  Chart 2  15 Year Forecast Returns vs  15 Year Actual Future ReturnsYou can see that 15 year  Regression Forecast  returns are  0 43  per year using market valuations as of February 28  2013 Putting the Predictions to the TestA model is not very interesting or useful unless it actually does a good job of predicting the future  To that end  we tested the model s predictive capacity at some key turning points in markets over the past century or more to see how well it predicted future inflation adjusted returns Table 2  Comparing Long term average forecasts with model forecasts You can see we tested against periods during the Great Depression  the 1970s inflationary bear market  the 1982 bottom  and the middle of the 1990s technology bubble in 1995  The table also shows expected 15 year returns given market valuations at the 2009 bottom  and current levels  These are shaded green because we do not have 15 year future returns from these periods yet  Observe that  at the very bottom of the bear market in 2009  real total return forecasts never edged higher than 7   which is only slightly above the long term average return  This suggests that prices just approached fair value at the market s bottom  they were nowhere near the level of cheapness that markets achieved at bottoms in 1932 or 1982  As of the end of February 2013  annualized future returns over the next 15 years are expected to be less than 0 percent  We compared the forecasts from our model with what would be expected from using just the long term average real returns of 6 5  as a constant forecast  and demonstrated that always using the long term average return as the future return estimate resulted in 350  more error than estimations from our multi factor regression model over 15 year forecast horizons  1 22  annualized return error from our model vs 5 55  using the long term average   Clearly the model offers substantially more insight into future return expectations than simple long term averages  especially near valuation extremes  Conclusions The  Regression Forecast  return predictions along the bottom of Matrix 4  are robust predictions for future stock returns  as they account for over 100 different cuts of the data  using 4 distinct valuation techniques  and utilize the most explanatory statistical relationships  The models explain up to 82  of future returns based on R Squared  and are statistically significant at p 0  Despite the model s robustness over longer horizons  it is critical to note that even this model has very little explanatory power over horizons less than 6 or 7 years  so the model should not be used as a short term market timing tool  Returns in the reddish row labeled  PE1  in Matrix 4 were forecast using just the most recent 12 months of earnings data  and correlate strongly with common  Trailing 12 Month  PE ratios cited in the media  Matrix 1  demonstrates that this trailing 12 month measure is not worth very much as a measure for forecasting future returns over any horizon  However  the more constructive results from this metric probably helps to explain the general consensus among sell side market strategists that markets will do just fine over coming years  Just remember that these analysts have no proven ability whatsoever to predict market returns  This reality probably has less to do with the analytical ability of most analysts  and more to do with the fact that most clients would choose to avoid investing in stocks altogether if they were told to expect negative real returns over the long term from high valuations  Investors would do much better to heed the results of robust statistical analyses of actual market history  and play to the relative odds  This analysis suggests that markets are currently expensive  and asserts a very high probability of low returns to stocks  and possibly other asset classes  in the future  Remember  any returns earned above the average are necessarily earned at someone else s expense  so it will likely be necessary to do something radically different than everyone else to capture excess returns going forward  Those investors who are determined to achieve long term financial objectives should be heavily motivated to seek alternatives to traditional investment options given the grim prospects outlined above  Such investors may find solace in some of the approaches related to  tactical alpha  that we have described

24457,245972,COHR,Slovenia Is Not The Next Cyprus  That Doesn t Mean It s Not In Trouble,opinion,Leo Tolstoy wrote that all happy families are alike  but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way  Much the same is true of economies  Maybe that was what EU Commission President Jose Barosso had in mind when he said recently that   it is a completely different situation in Cyprus and in Slovenia   Different  but in many ways no less dangerous  For those struggling to keep up with the ever evolving euro crisis  here are some of the key ways in which the impending crisis in Slovenia differs from and resembles the others The macroeconomic contextAs in many other countries  the crisis in Slovenia  which now centers on the banking system  has developed against a background of broader macroeconomic problems  Not long ago  Slovenia s economy was doing well  The country was one of the ten that entered the EU in 2004  Like others in its cohort  it initially enjoyed rapid economic growth  The following chart  which compares Slovenia s economic growth since 2000 with selected other countries  shows that before the global financial crisis  Slovenia looked a lot like Poland  one of the EU s biggest success stories  Since the crisis  it has looked more like Portugal What accounts for the shift from success story to problem case  Although many factors were at play  two were especially significant One factor was exchange rate policy  Beginning in 2005  Slovenia held its currency  the tolar  within a narrow trading band against the euro  In January 2007 it abandoned the tolar altogether to become the first of the new member states to officially join the Eurozone  On the whole  the new members with floating rates  illustrated by Poland and the Czech Republic in the chart  had a relatively easy ride through the initial phase of the crisis because nominal depreciation could absorb some of the shock  For example from mid 2008 to early 2009  the Polish zloty depreciated some 30 percent against the euro in nominal terms  helping give Poland the distinction of being the only EU member to avoid a recession  The Czech koruna depreciated by 17 percent over the same period  moderating the recession there  By comparison  euro members Portugal and Slovenia  along with Estonia  which was firmly locked to the euro by its currency board  suffered deeper initial downturns Another key macroeconomic factor was fiscal policy  One measure of a country s fiscal policy stance is its structural fiscal balance  that is  the surplus or deficit that its government budget would have if its economy were operating at full employment  or more precisely  at potential real output   A move toward deficit in the structural balance indicates fiscal stimulus  whereas a move toward surplus what economists call fiscal consolidation indicates fiscal restraint The following chart shows structural balances for the same five countries  Estonia  together with its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania  not shown  took strong fiscal consolidation measures as soon as the crisis hit  making their recessions even deeper than they otherwise would have been  The other countries shown all applied a greater or lesser degree of fiscal stimulus  The stimulus phase lasted longest in Slovenia  which did not begin consolidation until 2012  The stimulus no doubt moderated the initial downturn  but it also caused a sharp increase in the debt to GDP ratio  Slovenia s debt ratio  which as recently as 2007 was just 30 percent  is expected to rise above the EU s permitted threshold of 60 percent by the end of this year In short  as Slovenia faces a worsening banking crisis in the midst of a double dip recession  it finds itself with very little macroeconomic room to maneuver  Unlike Poland or the Czech Republic  it cannot rely on exchange rate flexibility to absorb further shocks to its economy  Unlike the Baltic States  which swallowed their prescribed dose of austerity medicine early  it is up against the EU debt limit  And that is not all  The available policy options are further constrained by growing public protests against austerity  which contributed to the collapse  in January  of Slovenia s previous government  The new government led by Alenka Bratusek has been reduced to making vague promises to pursue economic growth and fiscal consolidation without hampering the expansion  So far  those promises have not fully satisfied the protesters  One of them  who recently marched with a banner reading   We are not right and we are not left but we are the people who are sick of you   told a reporter for  that  the incoming government has the same structure  the same principles as the old one  so we need a new election and we have to vote out the parties that are in parliament at present  Structural and governance problems of Slovenia s banking systemSlovenia is neither an island nor a tax haven  Its banking system is relatively small by European standards  The ratio of banking assets to GDP  which is around 180 percent  is only about a third of the Eurozone average and far less than the ratios approaching ten to one of countries like Cyprus  Ireland  and Iceland  Unlike Ireland or Spain  Slovenia did not have a big housing bubble  and unlike Cyprus  its banks did not speculate in Greek bonds  Nevertheless  Slovenian banking has some serious problems of its own One of the biggest is that Slovenia s largest banks have remained under state control  As a recent financial system stability assessment from the IMF notes  the large  state controlled banks have not been well run  They have consistently had lower rates of returns on assets and equity than smaller domestic or foreign banks operating in the country  Also  as the following chart shows  Slovenian banks as a whole have one of the highest nonperforming loan ratios in Europe  Loans to the corporate sector  which is among the most heavily indebted in Europe  are a particular problem  especially loans to construction companies  Not surprisingly  these nonperforming loans are disproportionately concentrated in state controlled banks  No doubt some of the nonperforming loans reflect garden variety bad business judgment the lure of low interest rates  the belief that any boom  once started  will go on forever  and so on  However  the fact that the bad loans are concentrated in state controlled banks suggests that there may be more to the story than that  Using typically circumspect language  the IMF assessment refers to  long standing governance weaknesses  and a need for  reducing government influence on the day to day operations and lending decisions of banks   Protesters on the street see the problem more starkly as one of corruption  True  by broad measures  Slovenia is only moderately corrupt  Transparency International s  ranks Slovenia 37th out of 174 countries surveyed  Only Estonia has a better corruption rating among the EU s new member states  and Slovenia ranks higher than Italy  72  and Greece  94  among the 15 older members  However  looking more closely at the details behind the overall index  we see that some aspects of corruption are more problematic than others  For example  only 4 percent of Slovenians report having personally paid a bribe in the past year  compared to 16 percent of Greeks and 24 percent of Russians  That is all well and good  However  TI s public opinion data show that political parties  parliament  and the business sector are viewed as more corrupt than other institutions  Furthermore  75 percent of those asked believe that corruption has been getting worse  The protesters who brought down the government in January were angered not only by austerity measures but also by corruption scandals that involved high officials  The problems are not unconnected  On the one hand  with austerity pinching everyone s income  people are doubly angered if they find out that insiders have been getting fat at the public trough  At the same time  to the extent that corrupt mismanagement has weakened the financial system  it is partly responsible for the forced austerity the country is now facing  Slovenia has an independent  that has exposed some serious abuses  For example  last winter  it found the then Prime Minister  Janez Jan a  unable to explain the source of some  200 000 in unreported assets and expenses  It also uncovered evidence that he had purchased some of his real estate holdings with funds indirectly provided by construction companies that had major government contracts  The commission made similar findings against Ljubljana mayor Zoran Jankovi   2 4 million in unreported assets and  several financial chain transactions between the companies owned by Mr  Jankovi  s sons and companies doing multi million businesses with the city   Were any of these transactions channeled through state controlled banks or facilitated by loans made on favorable terms  It would be more surprising if they were not than if they were  What will happen next  The IMF sees strengthening of the financial condition of Slovenia s banks  followed by their privatization  as the government s top priority  Citing a 2011 stress test  its most recent financial stability assessment estimated that a double dip recession scenario hypothetical in 2011 but now a reality would require recapitalization in the amount of 5 percent of GDP  A more recent report based on a March 2013  raises the estimated capital shortfall to  1 trillion  or more than 11 percent of GDP  The government has made some progress in establishing a framework for resolution of the crisis  In October  it set up an asset management company  AMC  to take nonperforming assets off of bank balance sheets  The AMC is to conduct a  carve out   that is  an operation that moves nonperforming assets of banks to the balance sheet of the AMC and replaces them with instruments that carry government guarantees  Such an operation immediately improves bank liquidity  since the beneficiary bank can use the new state guaranteed assets as collateral for further borrowing  A carve out can also increase the banks  regulatory capital by replacing impaired assets that carry high risk weights for new assets with lower risk weights   See  for a detailed explanation of risk weighting and regulatory capital and  for a further discussion of carve outs and other methods for rescuing failed banks   Will it work  A lot depends on how competently and honestly the AMC carries out its mandate  For example  among its other powers  it will have the ability to convert nonperforming corporate loans to equity  thereby restoring some corporations to solvency under the AMC s full or partial ownership  Properly used  that power could strengthen the financial system  but it could also be used to shield well connected individuals from the consequences of past corrupt or incompetent actions  Even under the best of circumstances  the problem would remain of how to fund the recapitalization  Liabilities of the AMC are liabilities of the government  so any carve out immediately increases the government s total debt  If the AMC acquires nonperforming assets at a price higher than their book value  which would be necessary if the operation is to increase the bank s common equity  the operation becomes more expensive still  If the terms of the carve out are less advantageous  the operation could still leave banks with a capital shortfall that the government would have to make up in some other way  also adding to its debt  As the IMF points out  Slovenia appears to have fallen into a vicious circle  A weak economy is threatening the solvency of the corporate sector  Insolvent corporations are unable to repay loans  Nonperforming loans are eroding bank capital  At the same time  weaknesses of the economy and the financial system mean that the government  which has already borrowed to the limit  has limited access to international financial markets for the funds it needs to recapitalize the banks  What can be done to break out of the vicious circle  The IMF s March memo holds out hope for a  clear and coherent plan  that could quickly restore access to international capital markets  As part of that plan  it envisions a fiscal policy that would  continue to reduce the structural deficit  while letting the automatic stabilizers work    Translation  move the structural budget incrementally toward surplus by cutting back the country s welfare state while allowing the current deficit to rise as the economy sinks further into recession   Unfortunately  Prime Minister Bratusek has not yet tabled the requisite clear and coherent plan  If private lenders turn out to be unwilling to lend Slovenia the funds it needs to restructure its financial system and keep its government running  some other source will have to be found  One possibility would an Irish style bailout in which the EU loans the Slovenian government enough funds to recapitalize its banks while fully protecting depositors and senior creditors  That would ultimately transfer the burden of restructuring to Slovenian taxpayers  They might not take kindly to the prospect  especially if some of the protected depositors and creditors were political insiders or their friends  Alternatively  the EU might follow through on its latest theory that taking away the risk from the financial sector and putting it onto the public shoulders is no longer the right approach  Doing so would mean a Cyprus style bail in under which the EU would say to uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors  in the words of Dutch Finance Minister     Look  where you take on the risks  you must deal with them  And if you can t deal with them  you shouldn t have taken them on and the consequence may be that it s end of story   The problem is that EU authorities might not have the nerve to carry repeat that approach  fearing that using it too often could lead to a break up of the Eurozone itself  Meanwhile  markets are increasingly calling into question Slovenia s ability to refinance its existing debt  let alone take on the burden of bank restructuring  Yields on 10 year government bonds have jumped from 2 16 percent at the beginning of the year to 6 62 percent last week  The cost of credit default swaps has soared  Last Monday  the government tried to sell 100 million euros in Treasury bills  but managed to raise barely half the desired amount  The story has not yet played itself out  Stay tuned ,2013-04-15,Ed

24460,245975,COHR,Focus2   Spain Seeks A Second Wind,opinion,The Spanish government intends to slowdown the pace of fiscal consolidation  It has pushed back its target for reducing the public deficit below 3  of GDP from 2014 to 2016 The European Commission must officially approve the new budget trajectory  but it already esteems that it is coherent with Spain s economic situation Spain will continue to make major efforts not only in terms of public finances but also structural reforms On Friday  April 26  the Spanish government unveiled its new Stability Programme for 2013 2016  The programme calls for a net slowdown in the pace of fiscal consolidation  since the public deficit will not be brought below 3  of GDP before 2016  instead of 2014 as previously planned  The Spanish administration is now counting on reducing the public deficit by about 1 point of GDP a year  The new deficit reduction targets are 6 3  of GDP in 2013  5 5  in 2014  4 1  in 2015 and 2 7  in 2016  vs  its previous targets of 4 5  in 2013 and 2 8  in 2014   In 2012  the public deficit peaked at 10 6  of GDP  or 7  excluding temporary measures to support the banking sector To be ratified  the new pace of fiscal consolidation must be officially approved by the European Commission  EC  on 29 May  As part of the European Semester  member states and the EC work closely together to define targets to reduce the public deficit  In the first half of the year  member states send their Stability Programmes to the EC  which either approves them or recommends modifications  During the National Semester  in the second half of the year  governments transcribe the stability plans into national budgets  Without making a definitive pronouncement  the EC has already stated that  the postponement of the correction of the excessive deficit to 2016  in Spain  was consistent with the current technical analysis   This suggests that the new public deficit trajectory will probably be approved Discussions during the European Semester generally focus on budget efforts  namely on reducing the structural deficit  i e  corrected for cyclical factors and temporary measures   In Spain  the government lowered its 2013 growth forecast from  0 5  to  1 3   and this downward revision argues for an adjustment of  nominal  public deficit targets  while structural reform efforts remain very high  in the period 2013 2016  the Spanish authorities foresee a structural adjustment of 4 2 points of GDP  Spain can also soften its austerity policy now that it has regained some fiscal credibility  even at the expense of an abrupt drop off in activity and employment  According to the IMF  for example  Spain made the biggest budget efforts of any country in Europe in 2012  second only to Greece  The country also recapitalised its banking sector for EUR 37bn  3 6  of GDP  under a European programme  With the ECB s implicit support via OMT  Spanish sovereign rates have eased considerably to about 4  on 10 year government bonds  This gives the government some rooms to manoeuvre to adopt a slower but also more credible pace of consolidation The probable easing of budget targets in Spain also fits within a change of focus taking place in Europe in recent months  Henceforth  discipline focuses less on sharp spending cuts and more on implementing structural reforms  Spain will probably be given until 2016 to reduce its public deficit to below 3  of GDP  but it will have to begin immediately to reform its pension system  expand job market reforms and increase competition in its markets for goods and services Along with its Stability Programme  the Spanish government also presented its new National Reform Programme  Its eight key points include a public administration reform plan  creation of an independent fiscal authority  fight against redundancy at various levels of the state  public sector pension reforms   measures to support small businesses and boost international development  special VAT regime  tax incentives  creation of internationalisation bonds   energy sector reforms and the liberalisation of services  What can be expected from this new strategy  Adopting a softer pace of consolidation while accelerating structural reforms could fuel a return to growth by late 2013 or early 2014  on a quarterly basis  Assuming the reforms gradually boost medium term growth and activity begins to converge with its potential as of 2015  it should become easier to reduce public deficits  By narrowing the output gap  the difference between observed and potential output  by 1 point the public deficit would decline by an average of 0 5 points of GDP  The mechanism would be the opposite of the one currently at work  the unemployment rate would ease towards its natural level  increasing the tax base and reducing unemployment related spending  Once the output gap is closed  the budget deficit equals its structural component  In 2012  the EC estimated Spain s structural deficit at 5 9  of GDP and the negative output gap at 4 5   Taking into account the structural fiscal effort planned through 2016  and assuming the output gap will be reduced by half by then  the public deficit should come around 2 8  of GDP in 2016 BY Thibault MERCIER,2013-05-03,Philippe

24462,245977,COHR,Gold Arrives At Its Ideal Ratio Retracement  Now What ,opinion, Now remember  when things look bad and it looks like you re not gonna make it  then you gotta get mean  I mean plumb  mad dog mean   Cause if you lose your head and you give up then you neither live nor win  That s just the way it is      Clint Eastwood as  The Outlaw Josey Wales   Warner Bros   1976   And with specific reference to Gold  the key  of course  is to stay just that  The Course  Remember on New Year s Day our posting at the website a Buy for Gold upon that evening s market open   Twas then at 1676  Today  tis 1225  down 26  from that open  If one had taken a position back then via Exchange Traded Funds or equities  and en route through the tumbling have added more shares  suffice it to say  one has taken a heckova blow to the balance in one s account  More deleteriously  were one engaging in such increase in exposure via a futures account   and I ll leave it to you to calculate the current level of damage to date inclusive of the periodic add ons as posted at the website   in all likelihood    to eloquently put it in NASCAR engine expiration terminology     Dat account dun blowed up    barring it being sufficiently funded   The Stressful Anxiety of Gold s Going Back Up  Then there is this which shall be far more difficult for those who ve been giving up on Gold along its way down  and rightly so across the spectrum of personal risk tolerances   albeit arguably one ought never sell one s Gold    twill be having the understanding  the courage and the gumption to Buy back into Gold at levels above where losses were taken  For those who ve not stayed the course  indeed necessarily being unable to so do  the hardest thing to accomplish will be to leap aboard the Gold Troops  train after  tis well up the line from where many disembarked   Query  whilst the market  as we oft say  is never wrong    and  tis not just the so called  weak longs  that have been shaken out    has Gold now been beaten down to the point of absolute irrationality and then some when valued against the ever increasing excesses of the global money supply  Of course it has  Slipping below 1500  not to mention even beneath 1400  in April made Gold a bargain  Now having further dipped below 1300 and then under 1200 such as to briefly pass through its All Time Golden Ratio Retracement level of 1188 this past week has seemingly made it an embarrassment   From the standpoint were one not to have stayed the course  it reminds me of an old sports car   a somewhat rare model year   that I drove back in the  70s and  80s  Like Gold  it too became irrationally beaten down due to its being hard driven without the requisite  rational and respective attention it so deserved  Like Gold  it was eventually sold really low to a kid who took the bus down from Sacramento to San Francisco  We met outside a subway station  he gave me  2 500 and I gave him the keys  And like what will happen to Gold  I recently assessed the value for that old car model s year  and found the asking price now in excess of  100 000  an increase of 3900  over that for which I sold it   Now I m not saying that Gold is going to increase by such same percentage from that Golden Ratio level of  1 188 oz  to  47 520 oz  But just maintain in your fertile mind that Gold is a precious metal  it is rare  the amount produced each year is too tiny to be comparatively measured against the unconscionable pace of currency debasement   compounded by the thus created debt which has to be  repaid  via more debasement   and that  tis been regarded as money from Day One   Regardless  toward satiating all those disbelievers out there who remain convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that the yellow metal truly is going to Zero    0    I ve done them the following favour of determining  via linear regression  the precise date at which Gold ought reach naught   at which point they can then cover their Shorts   The graphic below charts the price of Gold from its All Time Closing High of 1900 on 22 August 2011 through its close yesterday  Friday  at 1235  to which we ve calculated and extended a least squares linear regression trendline  And how marvelously convenient  Gold would close at Zero in only some three and one half years on 22 December 2016  just in time for Christmas  Such an affordable gift for the children  twill be that little pure Gold wagon with the spoked wheels  As for the Missus  Not just one Gold Rolex watch  but ten  Collect the whole series   Exit Emotion  Enter Logic  Naturally for you great and good readers who make proper use of your brain  come the 2016 Holiday Season we ll likely be seeing ceaseless quantitative easings  round the world  perhaps a

that offers you not just one  but two  green  models of the reincarnated Yugo from which to choose  an artillery laden electrified barrier  round the entirety of Switzerland that automatically zaps anyone within 10km  and quite obviously Gold approaching the mid four figures   In fact  you do realize what occurred this past week with respect to the price of Gold since the Beginning of Time  non   Of course you do  my perennially being the last one to figure this stuff out   However  in the most unlikely chance that you ve been off the planet  guess what just happened  That s right  given its historical range of price from  0 to  1 923   the All Time Intraday High of 06 September 2011   Gold just completed the quintessentially classic All Time Golden Ratio 38 2  retracement this past week upon touching 1188 on Friday  And don t think it didn t go unnoticed  here is the one minute track of Gold for yesterday s complete session   Does this mean that the worst is past  As you know I called the bottom as being in back at 1322  Wrong  But 55 points to the good from low to closing high in a single session yesterday is impressive  especially given the foundation of the All Time Golden Ratio retracement level at 1188  Don t touch that dial      Nowhere to Run  What about Gold   To be sure  a declining Gold price can bring angst to even the most ardent of precious metals Bulls  their sanity fortunately maintained in the knowledge of it being just a matter of time until price comes all the way back up and beyond   as has been its dominant 7 000  year trend   However what really does get the internal acid a bubblin  is waking up to reports like this one from Reuters on Thursday   condensed such as to highlight the salient  or better  shocking bits         Europe strikes deal to push cost of bank failure on investors   The European Union agreed on Thursday to force investors and wealthy savers to share the costs of future bank failures   The plan stipulates that shareholders  bondholders and depositors with more than 100 000  uros   132 000  should share the burden of saving a bank   EU leaders agreed on a significant bail in to shield taxpayers  for a process in which shareholders and bondholders must bear the costs of restructuring first   The rules break a taboo in Europe that savers should never lose their deposits   a bailout of Cyprus in March that forced losses on depositors marked a harsher approach that can now   be replicated elsewhere    It makes the whole thing coherent   said French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici     Oh merci beaucoup  Pierre  upon whose comment I was put in mind of that Martha   The Vandellas powerhit classic from the Spring of 1965  Nowhere to run to  baby  nowhere to hide     But as we go to the weekly chart of Gold s bars  as droopy as they appear  I take comfort in the wisdom of the words quoted at the outset of this week s missive  Again  it ain t pretty  still  Gold s closing at 1235 was the highest above an intra week low  55 points  since that of the week ending 26 April  59 points  two months ago  As for Gold vis   vis its 300 day moving average  that  stalwart  time honoured bastion of support    such bastion remains well busted  On a comparative percentage basis to such busting back in 2008 of Gold s reaching 16  below its 300 day moving average  this time  round  tis been as low as 25   Next is part of the reason why   Caught in the Woes of Commodities  Throes  Gold  as  twas pointed out a week ago  is being disregarded as money and therefore has found itself within the fray of a variety of markets  downtrends  To wit  this treat of the entirety of our BEGOS markets complex month over month trading with their daily bars and those Baby Blues  such dots reflecting the consistency of each market s linear regression trend  the grey diagonal lines    Course  blame it on the Almighty Dollar  that globally revered financial hallmark with all the fortified integrity and strength of a somewhat soggy baloney sandwich on white with too much mayo  I mean honest to Pete  folks  is this really happening   After all  Fed President Fisher just reminded us that any tapering of quantitative easing does not mean  tis ending  So that reinforces the ultimate Gold Positive  Yet Fed President Kocherlakota put forth more oxymoronically that the Fed must emphasize its remaining accommodative for a considerable time after the end of quantitative easing  Really  A  does that make any sense and B  what can they dream up next  As long as  tis not an organized deflationary depression   twill only be a Gold Positive  Perhaps many of them   As to  over there   European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said that their monetary policy would remain accommodative  any exit from such remaining far off  Poor chap  an audit now shows that his own Italy risks potential losses of billions of  uros on derivatives contracts  created in initially inducting itself into the  uro  that were then later restructured at the height of the EuroZone crisis   Meanwhile on the Isles  revisions to economic data are indicative of the UK now being in deeper recession than as was initially measured  with forecasts for further gloom ahead   And thus at the end of the day  be it Across the Pond  StateSide  or even along the Pacific Rim   tis more of the same  which in turn means more

24480,245995,COHR,Why Compromise In Washington Is So Elusive,opinion,As we approach the Fiscal Cliff  or more properly Slope  I thought the Republican negotiating strategy was very revealing  Gerrymandering  the process by which Congressional districts are tortured into shapes that resemble something drawn by a drunk with a permanent marker  are certainly part of the issue  Although the original intention was to allow for districts that reliably elect minority candidates  the result has been districts that don t turn over  The strength of incumbency in the House of Representatives has the consequence that general elections matter less than the primary for the dominant party in that district  If a district reliably votes 60  Republican  or Democrat  the winner of the election will be the successful primary candidate from the party that normally prevails  Primaries matter a great deal for the House  Therefore  the failure of House Speaker John Boehner s Plan B two weeks ago is not an example of Republican self destruction  but rather of enlightened self interest A House Republican is more concerned about a Tea Party primary challenge than a general election loss to a Democrat  given the polarization of so many districts  Therefore it makes little sense for Republicans to compromise their principles in trying to resolve the fiscal cliff  They have little upside in any case from strong economic growth  it is Obama s Economy after all  and plenty of downside from a more Conservative challenger The New York Times added an interesting perspective to this last week  when they noted that on top of gerrymandering there appears to be a tendency of people to live in districts where their neighbors share similar views  This is not a welcome development for those who believe that compromise is the only solution to America s fiscal challenges  In fact  further electoral polarization would seem likely to drive even more partisan disagreement in Washington This is one reason why optimism about the fiscal future is not warranted  The tight races in elections are steadily diminishing  and we are headed for now in a direction of increasingly shrill disagreements  But under these circumstances one decision does appear illogical  In an era during which both political parties appear to be moving away from one another and towards their base  why would any voter split their vote  For just as President Obama won a renewed mandate from the American people  so did the House Republicans who retained their majority  Some districts  and some voters  clearly split their vote between a Democratic President and a Republican member of the House of Representatives  This happened notably in Florida where Obama barely clinched the state s electoral college votes with 50 0  while the state chose Republicans for 17 of its 27 members of the House of Representatives Clearly a substantial number of voters in Florida split their vote between a Democratic President and a Republican member of the House of Representatives  When Congressional relations were altogether more cordial such as under President Clinton the implicit desire for compromise possibly made sense  But following the last few years who can seriously expect compromise rather than the perpetual stalemate that has brought us to the edge of the Fiscal Cliff  The voters who split their vote don t really hold a coherent view  The parties are sufficiently far apart that expecting grand compromise appears rather naive Instead of blaming Washington  a portion of the problem lies with an electorate that in some cases has failed to carefully consider what type of government they want  As a result  hasty  superficial decision making based on sound bites has brought us the government we deserve  rather than the one we need ,2013-01-01,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-compromise-in-washington-is-so-elusive-149217,149217
24481,245996,COHR,Quarterly Outlook,opinion,Fiscal issues dominated the last few weeks of 2012 and are likely to provide headlines during the next several months as well  Therefore  it s worth contemplating what it means for investors  Following this most recent skirting of disaster with the Fiscal Cliff  it s possible to draw some inferences about how the ongoing budgetary debate will unfold  Both parties believe they won an electoral mandate for their policies  President Obama won re election  but the House of Representatives remained Republican  Moreover  there is less reason to expect this form of divided government to lead to grand compromise  The partisan split in Congress with fewer tight electoral contests is increasing the importance of the primaries in selecting candidates  Less turnover in Congressional seats gives the dominant party s core voters greater influence  This is most obvious in the House Republicans  rejection of compromise recently  revealing a greater fear of Tea Party challengers in 18 months than a general election loss  Similar dynamics exist for Democrats  The New York Times recently noted that Americans are showing a greater tendency to cluster in neighborhoods of like minded people  a development that will exacerbate the current trend towards argumentative government by further reducing the competitiveness of elections for the House of Representatives Realistic ExpectationsGiven the absence of much long term budget repair in the latest brinkmanship    combined with the polarizing dynamic described above    it seems that the most realistic expectation is for quite modest fiscal improvements albeit achieved under the threat of government induced catastrophe  The debt ceiling will no doubt provide another flashpoint for differing philosophies fairly soon  The fact that the recent compromise relied mostly on taxes with no meaningful spending cuts probably means the Republicans will look to this next manufactured crisis as an opportunity to advance that aspect of their agenda  It won t be long Moreover  for all the hand wringing over the long term outlook  it s not clear that there is much coherent political support for fixing it  Raising taxes and cutting entitlements are intensely unpopular  The near term benefits of prudence are hard to identify  The Federal Reserve is quite possibly shielding the economy from unhindered bond market feedback on the fiscal outlook through quantitative easing  so low interest rates don t portend much actual trouble  It s like predicting global warming during a blizzard    hard to get much serious attention Predictable LogicFor an investor  there is probably a little more certainty over public policy than was the case a month ago  Our government is not bold in confronting problems  but there is a certain predictable logic driving decisions  As a result  there is far more certainty about fiscal policy than was the case last month  Incremental improvements punctuated by a crisis with a dramatic conclusion are beginning to look like a pattern  It s not exactly what the Bowles Simpson Commission recommended  but it appears to be what the next couple of years at least have in store The increased certainty and the absence of any significant fiscal drag should allow corporations to make more confident long term decisions and be positive for growth  albeit punctuated with a political crisis from time to time  Equities continue to be attractive relative to fixed income  The Equity Risk Premium remains historically very wide  and with interest rates likely to remain below inflation  more so after taxes are included  government and high grade corporate bond markets remain a safe way to steadily lose purchasing power  It remains the case that 23 cents invested in equities will  with 4  dividend growth  deliver the same ten year return as  1 invested in ten year treasuries  After taxes with the new rates on income  dividends and capital gains the Math requires only 19 cents  High grade corporate bonds alter the comparison only modestly Income generating securities came under pressure late in 2012  As it turned out the increase in investment tax rates wasn t as punitive as might have been feared  The Low Beta anomaly persists  so our Hedged Dividend Capture Strategy   DivCap   consisting of a long short portfolio of  100 in stable  dividend paying stocks hedged with  50 short the S P 500 provides a good way to pick up dividend income with minimal equity volatility  I m currently adding to that strategy myself Tax ReformMaster Limited Partnerships  MLPs  also gave up some ground in recent weeks  But the tax treatment of MLPs did not change and with higher ordinary income tax rates the tax deferred nature of the distributions is now relatively more attractive compared with other income generating sectors on an after tax basis  If Congress decides to tackle tax reform this year MLPs will probably be vulnerable  However  their tax treatment has existed for over a quarter century  since the 1986 Tax Reform Act under Reagan  and improved energy infrastructure is an easily defended policy goal  Moreover  overhauling the nation s tax code will require a grand compromise between both parties so far removed from recent discourse that it barely justifies consideration ,2013-01-02,Simon

24496,246011,COHR,The Full Montier  Absolute Vs  Relative Value ,opinion,James Montier  one of our favourite thinkers and fellow evangelist for behavioural economics and evidence based investing  published a great report last year entitled      The piece is a tour de force against the ubiquitous concept of  Strategic Asset Allocation   SAA  which argues that investors should set an asset allocation at the start of their investment horizon that theoretically balances individual risk tolerance against long term average market risks  and then regularly rebalance back to this target allocation  As we have argued       traditional SAA is hamstrung because there is no mechanism to alter the asset allocation given changes in relative expected returns and risks from each asset class over time  Inconceivably  adherents to this approach would have advocated exactly the same mix of stocks and bonds in December 1999  when stocks were as overvalued as they had ever been in history  as they would have advocated in 1982 when stocks were dirt cheap  We have argued  and Montier apparently concurs  that investors should be constantly aware of whether prospective returns to stocks are high or low  and alter asset allocations accordingly through time  Montier is a die hard value investor  so he views prospective returns through this lens  He asserts that investors should only invest in markets when they offer the prospect of reasonable future real returns on the basis of reasonable valuations  and they should avoid markets when they offer low returns  While this seems eminently reasonable  in practice this logic can be very difficult for investors to adhere to because markets can continue to get more and more expensive  or cheaper  for many years  and investors often find it difficult to stand on the sidelines and watch the market shoot into the stratosphere  For example  markets entered a period of extreme valuation by many measures in 1994 and continued to push higher for 6 more years before finally succumbing to valuation levels that were  by some measures  more than twice as high as any other period in history  For this reason  most wealth managers  institutions  and advisors practice Strategic Asset Allocation  which keeps investors fully invested in their target mix of stocks and bonds at all times  Where active bets are taken in pursuit of better performance  they take the form of relative value approaches where individual securities are selected for portfolios because they have lower valuations than their peers  This approach is starkly different than the absolute value approach described in the previous paragraph because with the absolute value approach  an investor will hold cash when no investments offer strong absolute returns  whereas relative value investors will always be fully invested  even when all investments are expensive and offer low returns Absolute Value  A Few Tests We thought it would be fun to test an absolute value approach per Montier s prescription using our favorite long term stock market data source  Shiller s database  The following charts illustrate how an absolute return investor might have fared had he chosen to move out of stocks and into cash where the real absolute valuation of the stock market ended the prior month below a certain threshold  For ease  we chose the cyclically adjusted earnings yield as the valuation metric  which is just the reciprocal of the Shiller PE  We then adjusted the yield value for the realized year over year inflation rate to find the real earnings yield  Finally  we used an  expanding window  approach to find the percentile rank of the real earnings yield to eliminate as much lookahead bias as possible  Note that because we are using real earnings yieldrather than nominal earnings yield  markets can get cheap or expensive in three ways changes in inflationchanges in earningschanges in priceAs a result  while markets would appear to be quite expensive today based on nominal earnings yield  which is in the top quintile of all values over the past 140 years  the real earnings yield is less extreme because yoy inflation is so low  Should inflation pick up  the real earnings yield will decline  all else equal  which would alter the current state of our model  in stocks or in cash    Chart 1  Valuation based asset allocation  own S P500 when valuation   long term average  otherwise hold cashSource  Shiller  2012   Federal ReserveUsing the expanding window approach  an investor would have spent about 80  of months in cash over the past 80 years or so  implying a fairly consistent expansion in PE ratios over time  we identify periods where market valuations are above our threshold with grey areas on the chart   Even so  by investing in markets only when they are truly cheap    median real earnings yield  and holding cash otherwise  investors would have generated about 70  of the total return to stocks with less than half the volatility and 73  lower drawdowns since 1934  The reduction in drawdowns is especially important in the context of Montier s definition of risk  the permanent impairment of capital We know from history however that when markets move from being inexpensive up through fair value  they usually move well into the range of  overvalued  before peaking  If that s the case  investors might choose to hold onto stocks until they move further into the expensive range  Chart 2  shows the performance of a strategy that holds stocks unless they are in the top quintile of valuations  bottom quintile of real earnings yields   and holds cash otherwise Chart 2  Valuation based asset allocation  own S P500 when valuation   80th percentile  otherwise hold cashSource  Shiller  2012   Federal ReserveBy tolerating higher  but not extreme  valuations investors would have achieved higher returns than the markets overall  11 4  vs  10 4   with 26  less volatility and 40  lower drawdowns  As a result  the Sharpe ratio of this approach was 0 8 vs  0 51 for buy   hold A more coherent approach to this framework might eliminate the absolute threshold entirely in favour of a scaled approach  For example  an investor might hold stocks in proportion to the percentile rank of the real earnings yield  and hold the balance in cash  For example when the real earnings yield is at the 80th percentile  the investor would hold 80  stocks and the balance of 20  in cash  Conversely  when stock earnings yields are at the 20th percentile  he would own 20  stocks and 80  cash  Again  this measure is based on valuations at the prior month s close  and using an expanding window to avoid lookahead bias  Chart 3  shows the results of this approach Chart 3  Valuation based asset allocation  own S P500 in proportion to the percentile value of real earnings yield  hold balance in cash Source  Shiller  2012   Federal ReserveThis coherent approach avoids having to choose a cutoff threshold  which makes it more robust  Further  the Sharpe ratio is almost as high as for the model with an 80th percentile threshold  though in this case it is because of very low average volatility  5 1  vs  9 6    as the returns are considerably lower Lastly  we wondered how the same approach would have worked if instead of allocating to cash  we allocated to Treasuries  Chart 4  gives us the answer Chart 4  Valuation based asset allocation  own S P500 in proportion to percentile value of real earnings yield  hold balance in Treasuries  Source  Shiller  2012   Federal ReserveFuture DirectionsJames Montier is incensed by the ubiquitous calibration of strategic asset allocation with  static  asset allocation because static allocation makes no accommodation for the fact that market valuations and commensurate expected returns fluctuate dramatically over time  Does it make sense for investors to be mostly indifferent to expected returns in setting their asset allocation targets In keeping with Montier s absolute value philosophy  we investigated several dynamic allocation strategies based on reducing or eliminating exposure to markets as they get more or less expensive  using the real earnings yield as our yardstick  In every case we tested the absolute value based approach delivered a higher Sharpe ratio  and a much higher ratio of returns to our approximation of Montier s measure of risk   maximum drawdowns The primary challenge with these approaches is that they require adherents to exit markets just as the party gets going into major peaks  Major market peaks manifest in the midst of extreme optimism and enthusiasm about the future which sweeps every last investor dollar into stocks over several euphoric years  It takes extreme fortitude to stand aside in cash during these long periods of parabolic market gains  and we know from the published studies in behavioural finance that most investors will buckle and go all in just before the market peaks and rolls over Investment managers that adhere to this type of approach will suffer enormous career risks during these periods  and lose a large portion of their assets under management  Montier s current firm  GMO  admits to losing over 40       of total client assets in the several years leading up to the 2000 market peak  and John Hussman has experienced similar investor attrition over the last few years as his valuation models have kept him largely on the sidelines during the market s current bull market run  To paraphrase Keynes  The markets can stay irrational longer than you can keep clients  We believe that successful investment management involves two key elements  Systematically apply an evidence based approach to investments that maximizes return with minimal riskAll else equal  and with a clear understanding of investors  behavioural flaws  apply a strategy with the highest probability that investors will stick with it over timeavoid large drawdowns to reduce emotional decision making based on fearparticipate in major bull markets to reduce emotional decision making based on greedThere are several approaches that embrace these two broad qualities  but our preference is toward strategies that leverage momentum and volatility management  These techniques are practiced with demonstrable results by the best trend following managers  but we d like to think our Adaptive

24497,246012,COHR,14 Charts On Money Supply  Deficits  And Housing Prices,opinion,Milton Friedman once declared that  inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon  in the sense that it can only be produced by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output  Friedman might not have been 100  correct on this  but he was damn close  For instance  San Francisco real estate price inflation can be more easily explained by artificial scarcity resulting from development restrictions than money supply growth  Yet  most instances of nation wide price increases can be explained by high money supply growth  typically resulting from excess spending by the Federal government  and or via loose monetary policies from the Federal Reserve Bank For this reason  I ve been watching money supply growth and housing prices closely over the past few months  My view is that stagflation is a real possibility in the upcoming years  perhaps somewhat similar to what we saw in the 1970 s  Such an episode would favor certain investment classes  with real estate  commercial banks  and insurers being most likely to benefit in my view It s extremely difficult to predict rates of inflation or future housing prices with any degree of accuracy  and it normally suffices merely to be correct about the general direction of things  That s my primary goal Unfortunately  it s complicated by the tug of war that is currently happening in Washington  Even with the fiscal cliff deal  we now have another potential debt ceiling battle  Let s also not forget another major economic event that will take place over the next year  the implementation of Obamacare  While the past data may point one way  it would be easy for another political event to shift things in another direction That said  here s the data I ve been looking at The Budget Deficit and the Fiscal Cliff DealThe Federal Reserve s recent statements regarding an employment mandate are cause for concern  but it s reckless spending by the current Administration and Congress that worry me more than anything  The chart below shows the U S  budget deficit as a percentage of GDP since 1947 Given that the U S  is a sovereign issuer of its own currency  what this means is that   and that larger budget deficits mean higher inflation risks  The recent fiscal cliff deal barely puts a dent in this  lowering the projected budget deficit from around  1 1 trillion to maybe  900 billion  Even that is based on the flawed assumptions that higher taxes won t lead to some contraction in Federal tax revenues and that entitlement spending won t increase significantly in the upcoming years  a dangerous assumption if there ever were one   M2 Money Supply Growth in the US Fiscal deficits should eventually result in significant increases in money supply growth  M2 is the broadest measure of money supply we have available  since M3 was discontinued in 2006  so this article focuses primarily on that measure  Let s start out with the basics  The following chart shows the year over year growth in M2 money supply since 1982  We are by no means at the highest level on that chart right now at 8 2  YOY growth  but we are nevertheless well above the historical average of 6 0  for the 30 year time period YOY charts of M2 growth can be a bit volatile  so one thing I like to examine is a 3 year rolling average of M2 growth  This has some advantages and disadvantages  The big advantage is that it smoothes out the growth rate and creates a more coherent chart that tends to make more sense historically  The disadvantage is that the figures can be skewed upwards or downwards by older data The 3 year rolling average shows us to be close to the high end in the 30 year time frame surveyed  with growth most similar to the late 90 s  There are two reasons to be concerned about this   1  the spike in money supply growth in the late 90 s seemed to signal the beginning of the housing boom  and more ominously   2  GDP growth is much lower this time than it was during that late 90 s early 00 s spike  Remember  we are not only concerned with money supply growth  but also output and if money supply growth is similar to the late 90 s  output growth most certainly is not M2 versus NGDP GrowthDue to this dilemma  I decided to take a look at M2 growth versus nominal GDP   NGDP   growth  The chart below shows M2 growth minus NGDP growth The way to read this chart is to focus on the 0  line  Anything above 0  indicates M2 growth that outpaces NGDP growth  Anything below 0  indicates NGDP growth outpacing M2 growth  We tended to stay with about 4  of that line for most of the series  but there are a few spikes above and below that  The mid 90 s produced the most interesting dip below 5   while the biggest jump upwards  before the past few years  came around 2002 as the housing boom was gathering more steam We saw another massive jump upwards during the financial crisis  And now we are in the midst of another mini spike above 5   Once again  we can examine all of this on a 3 year rolling average  as well Even though it looks like the figure is improving towards 2012  it s actually the result of the 2010 data skewing things downward  This data set cuts off in July 2012  and the 3 year rolling M2 growth rate is 6 0   In comparison  the 2 year rolling M2 growth rate is 8 0  for that same timeframe  a significant jump  Meanwhile the NGDP growth rate difference is somewhat negligible with the 3 year growth rate at 4 3  and the 2 year rate at a modestly lower 4 1  Suffice it to say  there is a large difference developing between M2 growth and NGDP growth and this has been a common state for much of the past 15 years  with the 2004   2008 period providing the sole exception to this rule  and a rather minor exception at that  M2 Money Supply Growth as a Percentage of NGDPThere are strengths and weaknesses with every chart in this article  My biggest concern with the M2 minus NGDP growth stat is that it fails to look at the M2 growth rate as a percentage of the overall economy  For instance  this stat would measure 15  M2 growth with 14  NGDP growth exactly the same as it would 3  M2 growth with 2  NGDP growth  Yet clearly  the former condition is more likely to lead to problematic inflation  and the high NGDP growth rate may merely be a result of said inflation You may notice in this flaw in the above two charts as there are no significant spikes in the highly inflationary 1970 s  In order to compensate for this weakness  let s examine M2 growth as a percentage of NGDP And let s also look at the 3 year rolling average again chart more clearly exposes the pattern in the inflationary 1970 s  as well as highlighting the low inflation  and more stable growth era in the mid 90 s  The housing boom on these charts does not look as bad as the 1970 s  but still shows much more rapid M2 growth than during the more stable early to mid 90 s period  We are at similar levels right now  but once again  the scarier thought here is that this M2 growth is coming without late 90 s GDP growth  Our NGDP growth over the past few years has been around 4   whereas late 90 s GDP growth averaged closer to 6  Japan versus the United StatesMany have compared the United States  housing crash with the collapse of the Japanese Asset Bubble  but in my view  there are major differences between the two  The next few charts are very enlightening in showcasing the very different M2 growth patterns in the U S  vs  Japan The first chart shows the basic YOY growth in M2 money supply in Japan from 1980 to 2012 We can see elevated M2 growth sustained over a long period in the 1980 s in Japan  From 1984 to 1991  M2 growth stayed above 8  and even drifted above 10  for most of the time between 1987 and 1991  After that  M2 growth plunges all the way below 0  by 1993  before stabilizing in the 2    4  range for several years  then eventually leveling off in the 2    3  range for most of the past decade We can also look at the 3 year rolling average with Japan  as well We see the exact same pattern  albeit with some of the spikes smoothed out  Now  let s compare that to the U S  over the same timeframe The YOY chart may be a bit difficult to read  but the most noticeable distinction is the Unites States  consistently high M2 growth rate relative to Japan after 1997  The 3 year rolling average is more enlightening By this measure  the U S  has maintained a significantly higher M2 growth rate than Japan after 1997  The United States  M2 growth rate would appear to average at least 400 to 500 bps higher than Japan s over the past decade and a half  If you want to look at both nations in terms of their respective crashes  the following chart examines this very theme  However  it first requires explanation For Japan  this chart starts in 1989  For the U S  it starts in 2006  For each nation  I pegged this about 12 24 months before the crash  The x axis is the number of months that have elapsed since the initiation date There s a very noticeable difference here  with Japan s M2 growth rate starting out at an extremely elevated level and plunging downward  Meanwhile  the U S  starts at a more moderate M2 growth rate  but there are two massive humps after the crisis hits  Those two massive humps are two very big reasons why the U S  may not be that much like Japan when it comes to inflation after the crash The Case Shiller IndexFinally  let s take a look at some Case Shiller data  Below I examine the 10 city index  The downside with this index is that it s not as broad of a dataset as the 20 city index  The upside is that the data set runs much longer as the C S 10 has been around since 1987  whereas the 20 city index was only created in 2000  I examined the differences between the two before and they have typically been very small Except  instead of looking at YOY changes  I want to look at quarter over quarter  QOQ  and half over half  HOH  changes  The reason for this is that housing prices were declining through January   February 2012  Since that point  prices have rebounded rapidly  making the YOY changes a bit deceiving  Indeed  the YOY growth for the Case Shiller 10 index is now at 3 4   while the half year increase is exactly the same  In other words  almost all the gains have come in the past six to nine months Below are the quarterly increases in the Case Shiller 10 And now for the six month increase Difficult to know what to make of this yet  but the pattern of price increases more closely resembles the beginnings of the late 90 s early 00 s housing boom than the early 90 s gradual recovery  It is worth noting that some of the large gains are coming from a handful of cities that have seen significant price declines previously  e g  Las Vegas   Therefore  this could simply be driven by a rebound in some of the more depressed housing markets  All the same  it s worth keeping an eye on  and I would not view the high volatility as a positive sign ConclusionsGiven the complex myriad of factors that determine inflation  I can provide no answers as to what the future holds  However  the charts in this article at least allow us to get a better sense of the inflationary risks moving forward  In my view  from the data I ve examined  inflationary risks are rising It s difficult to know how the fiscal cliff deal  the renewed debt ceiling debate  and the implementation of Obamacare might affect things  but assuming a continuation of the status quo  I believe that we would likely see a rise in inflation over the next 12 36 months  that could possibly force the Federal Reserve to re evaluate its dovish stance ,2013-01-06,Jake

24498,246013,COHR,Brent Cook  How To Turn Rock Into Money ,opinion,What if the shockingly low valuations of some junior mining companies are really all they re worth  As the market shakes off years of exuberance  Brent Cook  co editor of the Exploration Insights newsletter  searches for the truly undervalued finds as rare as gold itself  In this interview with The Gold Report  Cook talks about high margin deposits that the rest of the market can t see  The Gold Report  Brent  2012 was difficult for many gold investors  and you paint a pretty bleak picture for certain junior mining companies in 2013 as well  Brent Cook  We ve actually had two pretty tough years on the TSX Venture Exchange  It is off about 30  from its peak in 2012 and around 20  for the year  That comes on top of a 35  decline in 2011  I do think much of the froth is washed out and we will see some opportunities in 2013  During the most recent boom years  2009 and 2010  roughly  11 billion   11B  was raised on the Venture Exchange  Most of that has been spent without much success  Going by  database of about 1 800 Venture Exchange listed companies  there are around 600 that now have less than  200 000 in the bank and a full 62  of the 1 800 companies have a median working capital of only  1 1 million   1 1M  or less  These companies are trading at less than  0 20 share  which means that unless things improve dramatically in the next year  many of these companies are going out of business or will push excessive dilution on current shareholders just to stay alive  The Venture Exchange will truly be the land of the walking dead  This coming year will be a cleaning out process that in the long run is good for the sector  TGR  The Exploration Insights portfolio was not immune to what happened in 2012  It was up 4  from early January 2012 to late November  Are you convinced all of the companies in your portfolio should remain there  BC  We ve got to go through a cleaning out process as well  We ve had some real disasters  where the investment thesis didn t pan out  We ve also had a couple of big winners  The majority of the stocks that we own are undervalued  but they have held up well compared to the indexes  I just finished reviewing our 2012 performance and we have so far done surprisingly well on stocks we bought and sold in 2012  with an average gain of about 49   Unfortunately  the stocks we have held for over a year didn t do as well  taking our year over year average gain down to about 13   I ll have the final numbers out in our Jan  6 issue  TGR  What are you telling your readers to give them hope  BC  The truth  Hope is the worst reason to own a stock  We re not going to see  3 000 ounce  oz  gold  and we are not going to see junior stocks go to the moon this next year  If an investment thesis doesn t pan out  we sell and take the loss  If  however  the thesis continues to work  we hold onto the stock or buy more  This is very speculative money in a very high risk sector  Unless the risk trade comes back into favor this next year  and I don t think it will  it s going to be another tough one for the explorers and junior miners  That s all negative  right  But this is the smart time to pick up selective companies that have something of value  This is when investors can make money by buying intelligently and patiently  We may not be at the bottom  but it certainly isn t the top  TGR  What sort of trading range do you see for gold in 2013  BC  What s more important to me than gold s trading range  at least with regard to the junior explorers  is that the industry is not able to supply new deposits and discoveries to replace what is being mined  This is a serious issue that in the long run bodes well for this sector  Since about 1995  the number of ounces discovered has been trending straight down  According to the Metals Economic Group  in 2011 approximately 10 million ounces  Moz  were discovered  but 83 Moz were mined  That gap in production versus discovery is the opportunity  regardless of the gold price  which I think is flat to marginally higher in 2013  TGR  A lack of discoveries is hurting the industry  BC  It s getting tougher and more costly to find gold  That is the real issue  A company that raises  5M gets half as far as it did eight years ago  During the past six years  the major gold mining companies have spent the equivalent of 40  of market capitalization developing new deposits  It is projected that they would spend another 60  of their capitalization developing the new mines they have on the books just to keep production even  Moving reserves to production comes at a big cost  I ve posted an  on my website that goes into a lot more detail regarding the dismal state of both the gold miners and explorers that should help readers understand the depth of the problem and opportunity  TGR  Let s get into your process  One phrase you use a lot is   How much is it going to take to turn this rock into money   What calculations do you use to help determine that  BC  There aren t any easy numbers I can throw out there  Every deposit presents different challenges and companies spend tens to hundreds of millions of dollars figuring out how much it is going to cost to turn the rock into money  Actually  one rule of thumb is the cutoff grade used in estimating the tonnes and grade of a deposit  In theory  that cutoff grade should be what a company or resource estimator projects is the break even point between making money and losing money  If the cutoff grade is  say  0 5 grams per tonne  g t   then I like to see an average grade that is at least twice that  say  over 1 g t  because above that is where you really make the money  if the cutoff assumption is close  Then you ve got to look at metallurgy  This is probably the most important aspect of any deposit once it has been found  For instance  an oxide deposit sitting on the surface in Nevada with a cutoff grade 0 2 g t can still make money  whereas another deposit in Nevada at 5 g t cutoff won t  It is highly variable  All that the retail investor can do is guestimate if the grade and tonnes are sufficient to cover the probable capital and mining costs  TGR  It s pretty easy for the average retail investor to get lost in a feasibility study  They are quite technical  I m certainly guilty of this  It s easy to look at the internal rate of return  IRR  and judge a deposit based on that  Is there a way to determine whether the IRR number is realistic  BC  IRR is a good metric to look at  especially if it is after taxes  TGR  Is there a minimum threshold  BC  I think 20  after tax  although it depends on where the project is located and on the exploration upside  That upside is the intangible that often decides if a deposit gets bought or not  TGR  What are some practical ways a retail investor can do due diligence  BC  Talk to management  Get comfortable with the team  There are a lot of good people in this industry and they are not hard to recognize once you start talking to them  Go to the company s website  How accessible it is  How much information does it give in news releases  Does it back up the data  Almaden Minerals Ltd   AMM TSX  AAU NYSE  and Mirasol Resources Ltd   MRZ TSX V  include details  details  details  Be wary of a company that puts out a news release with no maps  no sections and no data  Watch for news releases that report high grades smeared over long intervals  and always search for historical data from the property being promoted  Most properties have a history that gives you some insight into possible tonnes and grade  TGR  Almaden recently announced assays from four drill holes testing the eastern limits of the main zone at its Ixtaca gold silver discovery in Mexico  The company has discovered gold silver mineralization hosted in volcanic rocks versus limestone  and shale host rock in the rest of the deposit  What do you make of that  BC  I went down to Almaden s Ixtaca project two and a half years ago and bought the company then  This is a very big hydrothermal system and  potentially  precious metal deposit  The drilling to date has almost exclusively found gold and silver mineralization in sediments  My take is it s just touching the edges of the mineral system and the most recent drill holes are pretty encouraging  We ll see if Almaden can extend it 50 meters to the southwest or not  TGR  You don t believe that the company has found the heart of the deposit  but is Almaden any closer to the promised land  BC  The next drill hole will be either great or a bust  but is not the deciding factor for this deposit  The important aspect to me is that this is a big system  and big systems make big deposits  TGR  Some pundits have suggested that the success Almaden is having at Ixtaca has caused it to largely forgo the prospect generator model and focus on this deposit  Do you agree  BC  The company still has a number of projects ventured out  but you re right  it is drilling Ixtaca and will be drilling El Cobre  With the prospect generator model  a company generates ideas and vends them out when they get to be too high risk and costly  Therefore  the company doesn t dilute the shareholders to drill every low probability target it turns up  Most prospect generator companies are run by geologists who are good enough to recognize something above average when they stumble across it at which time they have the money and tight share structure that benefits long time shareholders  It takes a long time to work through projects and find something worthwhile and this model addresses that problem  A number of companies have morphed out of that business model to the benefit of shareholders  including Almaden  Mirasol and Kaminak Gold Corp   KAM TSX V   TGR  Have any other companies recently published important results  BC  Belo Sun Mining Corp   BSX TSX V  just came out with 4 1 Moz Measured and Indicated and 2 8 Moz Inferred  or nearly 7 Moz at 1 7 g t at its Volta Grande project in Brazil  That s a really strong resource number  These are broad coherent zones of mineralization  It ll be easy to mine  Yet  the stock s gone nowhere on the news  We can buy this company at the same price we could before the announcement  but it s got 2M more quality ounces  TGR  Is it a lack of faith or did the news get lost in a mass of information  BC  The sector has been so hammered that a lot of trading is now among a small circle of friends and enemies who are basically picking each other s pockets  That doesn t bode well for this next year  I don t know what it will take to bring new money in  We ve got nearly  1 700 oz gold  but nobody cares  Without new money entering the sector we will struggle  TGR  Would a company like Belo Sun  given its board and the merchant bank that is behind it  have any trouble raising cash  BC  It s got plenty of cash  And its deposit will likely get bought down the road by a larger mining company  TGR  It also has an exceptional board that has turned over a number of companies  Can you mention another company  BC  Lydian International Ltd   LYD TSX  has a 3 Moz deposit in Armenia  It s an oxidized deposit that will have low processing and production costs  Capital expenditures are relatively low  A recent feasibility study shows a net present value at 5  with gold at  1 500 oz of just over  1B  That s a  1B valuation at  1 500 oz for a market cap of  250M  TGR  Is it falsely being priced as if Armenia were a risky country  BC  Perhaps  Based on my visit to Armenia  I don t consider it a risky country  Maybe it s such a new location that many investors are leery  TGR  Lydian recently announced that it was going to modify its crusher design and try to reduce the footprint of its Amulsar deposit  Is that a good plan  BC  It is  It will increase production  make it a simpler operation and make Amulsar more valuable  TGR  Does Lydian have the money to build it  BC  It has the money to move forward this year and will begin site development  It is my understanding that the International Finance Corp   IFC  and European Development Bank want to put money into it  TGR  What are some other companies that you find interesting right now  BC  MAG Silver Corp  s  MAG TSX  MVG NYSE  Juanicipio project in Zacatecas  Mexico  is probably the best or second best undeveloped silver deposit in the world  MAG discovered the deposit with Fresnillo Plc  FRES LSE   Fresnillo is going to put it into production  Because the deposit is part of its namesake silver district  and there are without a doubt more veins to be discovered  it would make sense for Fresnillo to buy MAG Silver s 44  stake  eventually  TGR  MAG also has silver at the Cinco de Mayo project  Will Fresnillo buy its interest in Juanicipio or do an outright takeover  BC  I don t know  Fresnillo is a rather secretive Mexican company and it is hard to know what it actually thinks  Cinco de Mayo is a polymetallic deposit  It s got silver  lead  zinc and copper  I m not sure if that interests Fresnillo  My bet is that Fresnillo will take Juanicipio and MAG Silver will spin out Cinco and the rest of its projects into a separate company  I just don t know when  TGR  Rye Patch Gold Corp   RPM TSX V  RPMGF OTCQX  is in a legal battle with Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDM TSX  CDE NYSE  in Nevada  Is there any update on that dispute  BC  Rye Patch is making a bet that the mining law of 1872 holds up  I think it will  but it s going to be a long legal battle  Coeur d Alene has a plan of operation with the Bureau of Land Management that it believes gives it priority over claims that it failed to keep current  However  if a company does not keep its claims up to date in the U S   those claims are open to staking  It is clear to me what the end results should be but we are dealing with a David and Goliath scenario  TGR  Global Minerals Ltd   CTG TSX V  DPF FSE  hasn t done so well since you put it in the portfolio in March 2011  yet you still own it  Why  BC  Global Minerals has a good  easy to mine silver deposit in a Slovakian mining town  The infrastructure is more or less there  The underground silver and copper mineralization is there  I can show on paper that this project is considerably undervalued for its silver resource  and that doesn t even account for the exploration potential on trend  It is  however  a development story and these take time  TGR  Kaminak Gold Corp  published the first resource estimate on its Coffee gold project in the Yukon  It s 64 million tonnes at 1 56 g t  which equates to roughly 3 2 Moz at a 0 5 g t cutoff for the oxide and transitional material and 1 g t cutoff for the sulfide material  What are your thoughts  BC  I was impressed  Kaminak came out with more ounces than I expected  The grade is pretty good  The oxide material is positive from a processing perspective  I was more surprised at how the market reacted  which was basically flat  Kaminak is the market darling in Canada  Good guys  new all Canadian discovery  everybody loves it  But it publishes a 3 Moz resource and the stock goes nowhere  TGR  If it were 2007 and Kaminak had the same deposit and the same resource  what do you think it would be valued at  BC  It would be at least double what it is now  Back in 2007  everybody was happy and smart  We were all making money  The hedge funds were pumping money into the exploration sector  Now it s just about the opposite  TGR  Maybe we never return to those days  but when will the market properly value these types of deposits again  BC  It may be properly valuing many of them now  TGR  Oh my  BC  There are a few deposits Belo Sun  Lydian and a few others that are definitely undervalued  But when it comes to the resource and exploration stages  the odds of making an economic gold discovery are about 1 in 1 000  How do you properly value that  Andina Minerals Inc   ADM TSX V  was bought by Hochschild Mining Plc  HOC LSE   It had about 7M low grade  tough ounces up in the high Andes in Chile  It got about  10 oz and it may have overpaid  That s what it agreed to be paid  so we have to assume that that is a proper valuation for those ounces  TGR  Does a mine need to come into production and be successful before valuations go up in areas like Colombia  where there s a lot of exploration but not much coming up yet  BC  I was looking at the share prices of a number of companies that jumped into Colombia and put out initial results that many considered good  They excited investors with spectacular surface samples  and even some drill results  The results took many of the companies straight up and subsequently straight back down  Reality has set in  A lot of those discoveries turned out to be small plugs or narrow  high grade veins that don t offer much size potential  For the most part  it was pretty obvious what was being promoted but people wanted to believe  Now they don t seem to believe anything  We only own one Colombian company  Galway Resources Ltd   GWY TSX V   which was acquired and will be spinning out two new companies  TGR  Is there a company that could have a good 2013  BC  Mirasol  I ve spent a lot of time with this group of geologists  They find deposits  They re good at it  They ve made several discoveries in Argentina  Mirasol just sold 49  of one discovery to Coeur for  60M in cash and stock  It has another discovery it will be putting out a resource report on  and another it might release some good drill holes on  It has moved into Chile  You re paying  30M enterprise value for all of that and I m willing to bet that the company makes another discovery in the next year or two  TGR  Is there a parting thought you d like to leave us with  A crumb or two of hope  BC  This coming year is going to be a fantastic time to buy undervalued  high margin deposits that the rest of the market doesn t recognize  The long term prospects for the exploration sector look real good to me  but you better know what you are buying and why  I am afraid most of the fools have been washed out of the market  TGR  Thanks for that  Brent  BC  My pleasure   brings more than 30 years of experience to his role as a geologist  consultant and investment adviser  His knowledge spans all areas of the

24499,246014,COHR,Bash The Bankers Or The State  ,opinion,I don t much go in for the sport of  banker bashing   as I see the responsibility for the failures in the banking system sitting at the feet of politicians and other policy makers  Notwithstanding this  I have noted two articles  both of which could be said to be of the bashing variety  but which nevertheless capture some of the problems and the ongoing ludicrous situation of the banks being immune from their own failures  The first comes from Matt in the  improbable  Rolling Stone magazine  Matt has been railing against the excesses of the banks for a long time  His writing is polemical  includes ad hominems  and a list of other  sins   but he nevertheless makes some very good points  Somebody needs to  This is in his introduction  It was all a lie   one of the biggest and most elaborate falsehoods ever sold to the American people  We were told that the taxpayer was stepping in   only temporarily  mind you   to prop up the economy and save the world from financial catastrophe  What we actually ended up doing was the exact opposite  committing American taxpayers to permanent  blind support of an ungovernable  unregulatable  hyperconcentrated new financial system that exacerbates the greed and inequality that caused the crash  and forces Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to increase risk rather than reduce it  The result is one of those deals where one wrong decision early on blossoms into a lush nightmare of unintended consequences  We thought we were just letting a friend crash at the house for a few days  we ended up with a family of hillbillies who moved in forever  sleeping nine to a bed and building a meth lab on the front lawn  I will not quote endlessly from the article but his introduction sums up the situation  in his unique style  rather well  Regular readers will know that I was firmly opposed to any bailouts at the time of the financial crisis blowing up  and have been firmly against ever since  Of course  the massive scale of the bailouts in the US only became apparent a long time later  thanks to  in pursuing the detail of the Federal Reserve s support for the banks  at a grand total of over  7 trillion in guarantees and lending limits  The interesting thing about the Taibbi article is that it puts some of the details of the kind of shenanigans that were taking place  such as how bank executives benefited from the support  Again  I will not detail the article here  but my interest is that Matt seeks to foment outrage  and he is right to do so  The reason I mention Matt s article is that I had it in mind when I read   At the behest of its former chief executive  Maurice Greenberg  AIG  AIG  is  filed by its shareholders against the government  On Wednesday  according to the New York Times  Greenberg  87  will try to persuade the AIG board that the terms of the company s  182 billion government bailout were too onerous  the interest rates were too high  and ultimately  that AIG shareholders got a raw deal  What s that about biting the hand that feeds you  Since this article  AIG have rapidly  from the lawsuit in the face of general public outrage  The first reason I write this post is that the initial action of AIG is beyond belief  and indicates that they are entirely incompetent The second reason is a more fundamental concern  they actually must have thought that they could use the law to achieve their ends  This suggests that financial institutions really believe that the law in the US is putty to be toyed with  No sense of a functioning judicial system would give even the slightest inkling that AIG could win  but AIG nevertheless believed they might do so  Such an impression can only come from experience  and this returns to the many points made in Matt s article  The situation is one in which the US government and the federal reserve  and the judicial system seem completely under the influence of the major banks and financial institutions  Matt is seeking to foment outrage and I am guessing that  when surveying the world around him  he must be baffled that there is so little outrage  And there is so little  The nearest thing to popular outrage were the sit in protests whose name I cannot even remember  I did visit one of the sit in sites  and found that the protesters had nothing coherent to say   Other than this  there seems to be little popular outrage  and I find this odd  It seems that key institutions of state have been  and continue to be  corrupted by these major financial institutions  My belief is that part of the problem has been the focus on the ills on the banks  or  banker bashing   when the ills are actually to be found in the state institutions that are supporting them  I will even go as far as to say the banks are not to blame  Why  when they have every reason to play the game as they can do  would they do otherwise  Yes  there might be some personal ethics that might prevent the banks acting to use the system as they do but that is not the point  Banks  by their nature  are institutions aimed at making money and they will therefore seek to further this interest  There should never have been a state system that allowed their rampant corruption in the first place  and that system is and can only be the responsibility of the state  In summary  just as Matt must look around him with bafflement  I find myself doing the same  Where is the outrage  and demand for reform ,2013-01-10,Mark

24501,246016,COHR,Current U S  Energy Policy  Risk Management That Is Worse Than Ever,opinion,Current U S  energy policy is  in fact  a hodgepodge of disconnected policies designed for specific constituencies with no coherent goal  The country has subsidies for fossil fuels  subsidies for nuclear power  subsidies for wind and solar  and subsidies for insulating and retrofitting buildings  We also have energy standards for some appliances and miles per gallon standards for automobiles  What never gets asked and answered definitively in the policy debate is this  What should our ultimate goal be and when should we aim to achieve it  The first part of the question has elicited so many answers from so many constituencies that I may not be able to represent them all here  But here is an attempt to categorize the main lines of thinking concerning the country s energy goals  Seek the cheapest price for energy with the implication that environmental consequences should not be tallied as part of the cost Complete a transition to renewable energy as quickly as possible while drastically reducing the burning of fossil fuels Replace all fossil fuel energy with nuclear power Develop all sources of energy to make sure we have enough at reasonable prices  This is often called the  all of the above strategy  Goal 1 is really the argument put forth by the fossil fuel industry and therefore a defense of the status quo  Goal 2 is the dream of every climate change activist and clean tech executive  Goal 3 seemed to be gaining some momentum before the accident at Japan s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant dashed hopes for a widespread nuclear renaissance Goal 4 is being touted  who heads the U S  House Committee on Energy and Commerce  and it is   The so called all of the above strategy is the de facto energy policy of the United States  and the one which I described above as a hodgepodge of disconnected policies designed for specific constituencies with no coherent goal  Our energy policy wouldn t matter except for two things Fossil fuels supply more than 80 percent of the world s energy  and they are finite  We cannot count on them to supply energy to us indefinitely  We simply do not know when their rate of production might turn down though  is an ominous sign Climate change induced in large part by the burning of fossil fuels is proceeding faster than models have predicted  We don t have much time to reduce our carbon emissions radically in order to avert the risk of catastrophic climate consequences No one knows the future  not my congressman  not President Obama  not the fossil fuel industry  not even climate scientists  But  we can outline the risks we face based on what we know today  About fossil fuel supplies we know two key things  Already mentioned is that production of oil proper  crude plus lease condensate  has stagnated since 2005  Second  the remaining fossil fuels  especially oil and natural gas  will come from deposits that in general are smaller  less concentrated  harder to extract  in some cases due to geology  in others because of their location such as deep under the seabed and in the Arctic  and harder to refine  This means these fuels will be far more costly and be produced at rates that are unlikely to rival the rates of the previous easy to get oil and natural gas  About climate change we now know that it is proceeding faster than anticipated by climate modelers  That means the worst effects could arrive much sooner than expected  within a couple decades instead of several decades  When it comes to oil and natural gas  it s possible that yet to be invented technology will make them cheaper and easier to extract in the future  We just don t know  Even if that technology arrives  the ever increasing difficulty of accessing new deposits may more than wipe out any cost and productivity advantages  It s possible that climate change might slow down  But  that seems unlikely since events that are markers for the progress of climate change such as the melting of Arctic ice are occurring much sooner than anticipated  A few years ago it was thought that the Arctic might become ice free in the summer by mid century if we maintained our current greenhouse gas emissions trajectory   The point is that when it comes to fossil fuel supplies most of the current information suggests that supplies will likely not be as abundant or as cheap as the industry has been leading people to believe  And  when it comes to climate change  the effects and the time of their arrival have been consistently underestimated  To manage energy supplies and climate risks  the United States has done little in terms of policy that makes sense given the gravity of the challenges it and the world face  It is important to note that risk is not merely a function of probability  Rather  it is the product of probability times severity  But  neither variable can be assessed in a strictly numerical way given how complex the energy and climate systems are  We do know  however  that if the pessimistic scenarios for both energy and climate arrive  we are in deep  deep trouble  Here is a key insight into risk management  The accuracy of any forecast decays quickly with time  That means that when it comes to long term forecasts  it is not the forecast itself  but the RANGE of possible outcomes that is more important  Any forecast that doesn t include a range is practically worthless for scenario planning purposes and probably designed to deceive rather than inform you  And  it s not the benign outcome that should concern us  but rather the possible dire outcomes  Why is this so  As Nassim Nicholas Taleb  author of several books relating to risk including Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan reminds us    I t does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear   It seems obvious that the destruction of modern civilization as we know it due to inadequate energy supplies and rapid climate change ought to be something we consider  too costly to bear   And yet  America continues with energy policies that are almost certain to fail because we are largely repeating what we ve done before  The de facto American all of the above energy policy implies that increasing the rate of fossil fuel combustion should be one of our goals  That policy also fails to concentrate enough capital spending on the infrastructure  mostly electrical  needed to exploit renewable energy  So  we end up with a strategy that assumes that fossil fuel supplies will remain adequate for decades and that climate change will remain largely benign during this period  This is not so much managing risks as ignoring them  Some will point out that the administration is working on carbon sequestration so as to make it possible to increase fossil fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions at the same time  The idea that carbon sequestration could achieve this result in time to avert a climate catastrophe has already been laid to rest by some fairly straightforward calculations done by energy expert Vaclav Smil    This means that in order to sequester just a fifth of current CO2emissions we would have to create an entirely new worldwide absorption gathering compression transportation storage industry whose annual throughput would have to be about 70 percent larger than the annual volume now handled by the global crude oil industry whose immense infrastructure of wells  pipelines  compressor stations and storages took generations to build  Technically possible but not within a timeframe that would prevent CO2 from rising above 450 ppm  parts per million   And remember not only that this would contain just 20 percent of today s CO2 emissions but also this crucial difference  The oil industry has invested in its enormous infrastructure in order to make a profit  to sell its product on an energy hungry market  at around  100 per barrel and 7 2 barrels per tonne that comes to about  700 per tonne  but  one way or another  the taxpayers of rich countries would have to pay for huge capital costs and significant operating burdens of any massive CCS  carbon capture and storage   Perhaps the simplest way to manage the energy transition we must undergo would be to impose a high and ever rising tax on carbon  Such a tax would not favor one particular solution to carbon free energy  But  it would move people to conserve and to switch from carbon fuels  It would also provide inventors and businesses with the incentive needed to work out the quickest  most economical path to a renewable energy economy  Quite often politicians and representatives of the fossil fuel industry sometimes it s difficult to tell the difference will say that the United States shouldn t undergo this energy transition alone because it will be put at a competitive disadvantage on world markets  Saying this is really the equivalent of saying that we should maintain our current course until it becomes obvious even to the most dimwitted that we are all committing suicide  Waiting for catastrophe to happen before acting means that it s too late to act  It is precisely this scenario that proper risk management is designed to avoid  If I were to grade America s risk management strategy with regard to energy supply and climate change  I would  not surprisingly  give it a failing grade  I only wish the damage inflicted by that strategy were limited to bad marks  Instead  the real world consequences are almost certain to grow larger and larger  the longer the country ignores intelligent risk management principles ,2013-04-01,Kurt

24502,246017,COHR,Ahead Of Friday s Nonfarm Payrolls,opinion,This week s payrolls report comes on the heels of some disappointing data  which has fuelled fears that the U S  economy may be losing momentum  In particular  the pullback in March hiring in the ADP report and ISM survey suggests a downside risk to Friday s figure Last month  nonfarm payrolls shocked the markets    to the upside  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 236 000 in February  versus  119 000 revised January   and the unemployment rate edged down to 7 7 percent  versus 7 9 percent January   according to the Employment Situation report compiled by the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  Job gains were seen predominantly in professional and business services  construction  and health care ADP Numbers DisappointAccording to the March ADP National Employment Report  private sector employment increased by a fewer than expected 158 000 jobs from February to March  the smallest increase since October 2012  The median forecast of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 200 000 advance  Estimates ranged from gains of 170 000 to 240 000 The   majority of the new jobs  were  created by service providers  said Carlos A  Rodriguez  president and chief executive officer of ADP  Mark Zandi  chief economist of Moody s Analytics  said  Construction employment gains paused as the rebuilding surge in the wake of Superstorm Sandy ended  Anticipation of Health Care Reform may also be weighing on employment at companies with close to 50 employees  The job market continues to improve  but in fits and starts  The ISM Non Manufacturing Employment Index registered 53 3 percent in March  which reflects sector growth for the eighth consecutive month  but a decrease of 3 9 percentage points from February  Twelve industries reported increased employment  including Construction  Accommodation Food Services  Transportation Warehousing  and six industries reported decreased employment  including Mining  Real Estate  Rental Leasing Friday s NFP ExpectationsThe nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday is expected to show employers hired a net 195 000 workers in March  according to the median forecast of 87 economists surveyed by Bloomberg Last month saw an end to the political wrangling on sequestration  Across the board automatic spending cuts will slice  85 billion from a  3 6 trillion budget over the seven months spanning March September  While the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimates that the measures passed will cost 750 000 jobs and lower economic growth by 0 6 percent by year end  the full impact of sequestration has not been felt yet  In fact  sentiment has likely improved since the Republican Democrat squabbling came to an end  which could boost private payrolls Government payrolls are expected to have dropped by about 9 000 after falling 10 000 in February  Whilst many government agencies are implementing furloughs  forced unpaid days off   the nonfarm payrolls survey counts anyone who was paid in the reference period as employed    which means employees put on furloughs will still be included in the payroll total  In addition  most agencies are required to give one month s notice before furloughs begin  suggesting it is too soon for any effects to be felt  It is too soon for any impact  of the sequester  to show up in March s data  Paul Dales at Capital Economics said in a note to clients  But there s little doubt that the  85 billion of government spending cuts that were enacted at the start of March will have some impact on the labor market  Dales added The Small Business EffectA number of recent smaller surveys  e g  PNC Economic Outlook  Intuit Inc  Small Business Indexes  have suggested that small business hiring is slowing  While a sense of  cautious optimism  is referenced in a number of these reports  it seems a majority of small businesses are looking to hold off from hiring during the next six months  Reasons offered include the ability to do more work with fewer employees  business regulations  and increasing health insurance costs related to  Obamacare  There are also concerns about the construction sector  The ADP report indicates that construction employment may have been weaker in March as rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy came to an end  However  the ISM survey suggests otherwise  according to their findings  construction saw the greatest increase in employment during March  The jury is still out on this one Recent Fed comments on the employment outlook have been varied  On Thursday  Fed s Evans mentioned in a joint public debate with Fed s Lacker that the Fed was still  missing tremendously  on the employment side of its dual mandate  while its other charge  inflation  was under control  Fed s Dudley concurs  he recently stated that the Fed must remain very accommodative because the labour market remains  far from healthy  in spite of some recent overall economic improvement Coherent Signs Of Improvement On the other hand  Fed s Williams  who spoke yesterday  said that he believes there are coherent signs that the labour market is improving  At the end of March  Fed s Pianalto also said she was encouraged by more robust job growth in recent months  I would regard a slowing in the pace of asset purchases to be a welcome direction for monetary policy if it resulted from a significant improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions  she said More insight was offered by Fed s Raskin who commented that too much of the recent growth in employment was concentrated in low wage and temporary jobs  leaving the recovery on shaky ground  She added that monetary policymakers are doing all they can to promote stronger economic growth and encourage hiring  Fed Chairman Bernanke was also recorded as saying that because of demographic trends  I doubt there will be an increase in labour force participation in the near term The Bureau of Labor Statistics  Employment Situation survey is released 8 30 a m   EST  Friday 5 April 2013 ,2013-04-04,Hannah

24539,246054,COHR,Will Bolivia Ever Become The Saudi Arabia Of Lithium   ,opinion,In a pair of blogs published on EVWorld com in  and  2009 I argued that three conditions needed to be met for Bolivia to become the  New Saudi Arabia of the World   First  the electric car rush should have started along with the launch of GM s Volt  Second  Bolivia had to have begun producing lithium carbonate in a proportion appropriate to the world s needs  Third  increases in lithium prices should not have made production of other lithium resources  e g  spodumene  commercially viable  As of now  the electric car rush seems to have started   albeit at a rather slow pace   following the launch of GM s Volt together with a number of other plug in vehicles  all of them using Li ion batteries  Secondly  Bolivia has thus far failed to begin producing any lithium carbonate and prospects about the country becoming a lithium superpower in the world are nowadays only part of the government s  wishful thinking   Thirdly  lithium prices have increased somewhat in the last two years or so after the emergence of new sources of demand for lithium which  in view of the difficulties faced by Chile and Argentina to produce more lithium  has in fact contributed to converting Australia   a spodumene producer   into the world s leading producer of lithium  In this context  Bolivia appears to have missed for the time being a golden opportunity to become the  New Saudi Arabia  of lithium  Still  based on figures provided by Francois Risacher in 1991  mostly accepted by the United States Geological Survey since January 2010  the Salar de Uyuni remains the most important source of lithium in the planet  holding today about 25  of the world s identified lithium resources  The main problem Bolivia is facing right now is not funding but technology  I have written extensively on the limitations of technologies based on solar evaporation to extract lithium from the Uyuni salt fields  After almost 5 years of experimentation  the Bolivian government has come to realize that the effort and time spent do not match to the kind of results obtained  However  this has not prevented it from inaugurating in recent months 3 pilot plants to produce lithium carbonate and potassium chloride which at the present day are not fully operational  and in a few weeks a new pilot Li ion battery plant is to arrive in Bolivia from China although nobody knows where it will obtain the raw materials  e g  lithium carbonate or hydroxide  from to operate  The government is working hard to try to convince public opinion in Bolivia that everything is under control and on schedule but evidence is accumulating that that is not the case  Over this time period  Bolivia engaged in different sorts of negotiations with the firms Bollore  BOL PA   France   Sumitomo  NSSMY  and Mitsubishi  MIMTF   Japan  and other important players such as Posco  PKX  from South Korea and the Citic Guoang Group from China  all of them interested in the Bolivian lithium  However  lack of a coherent strategy prevented the government from achieving the goals it was expecting  The government did in fact signed significant agreements with the consortium formed by Posco and Kores and the Citic Guoang Group to produce lithium cathodes in Uyuni  Potosi  and explore Salar de Coipasa  Oruro  respectively  But as of today neither of these endeavors shows any meaningful progress  In the first case  it appears like all activities were paralyzed due to lack of understanding between partners on a crucial point   discovered by Posco Kores using intangible Bolivian brines given for free by the government for which the consortium now wants to charge a fee  In the second  there is absolute secrecy as to the reasons why evaporite resources exploration at Coipasa remains a task carried out solely by Bolivia despite the agreement signed with the Chinese  As I mentioned above  prospects for Bolivia to take off as a lithium  are now distant and uncertain  Unless the country changes significantly its lithium strategy  it is highly unlikely that Bolivia will become relevant in the lithium market in the following ten years or so  Under these circumstances  the skepticism around Bolivia s lithium is fully justified  A new review of the facts surrounding Bolivia s possibility of becoming the new Saudi Arabia of lithium in the World depicts a rather pessimistic short term prospect for the country holding at least one fourth of the planet s identified lithium resources ,2013-04-07,Juan Carlos Zuleta,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-bolivia-ever-become-the-saudi-arabia-of-lithium--161955,161955
24565,246080,COHR,The World Economy  The State Of Play ,opinion,First of all  I would like to apologise for the lack of posting for so long  I have several times sat down to start to post  but was somewhat at a loss as to where to start  I had a quite a long period in which all I had time for was a major project  and returning to posting has been difficult in the face of an ever more  odd  world economic situation  Too much cries out for attention  and this is the problem  each of the many stories that are ripe for discussion do not make sense in isolation  As such  I will try to give a selective overview  and do so in the context of my underlying thesis of the causes of the world economic crisis   Note  as I have pressed forward in the post  I have limited references links  and also digressed from my original purposes for the post  I hope that it still remains a coherent view    First of all  I will briefly outline my explanation of the crisis in the world economy  One of my discussions of the underlying cause can be found on   and I recommend reading this if you are new to the blog  there is a more detailed version somewhere  with more figures  but I forget where it is   The short version is that  with the entry of economies such as India into the world economy  there was a huge supply shock  The labour available to the world economy  by which I mean with capital and connected into the world economy  has approximately doubled  Even whilst this was taking place  the supply of many commodities failed to keep pace with the expansion of the labour force and  for other commodities that did expand in supply  the demands of building new infrastructure in places like China saw demand explode to a degree that commodity supplies still struggled to keep pace with demand   The result of the labour supply shock  in conjunction with the problems of commodity supply  saw what I term hyper competition  I dispute the idea that the  financial crisis  was the cause of the economic crisis  but argue that it was instead a symptom of the supply shock  see the Huliq article for why   The economic crisis is resultant from hyper competition  and the shift of limited resources towards the  emerging  economies  From this underlying thesis  I have argued that the result will be that there will be a re balancing of wealth around the world  Contra to the argument that the emerging economies would grow in wealth whilst the developed world continued to be wealthy  I have argued that the world economy would grow overall in wealth  but that the growth in wealth of the emerging economies would  due to redistribution of limited resource  come at a cost to the developed world  Whilst the emerging economies grew in wealth  the developed economies would generally see an erosion of wealth  In the Huliq article  I link to my early posts on this thesis in 2008  Time has now passed  and we can start to see the outcome of the labour supply shock  An interesting example can be found in the many stories coming out of the US describing the shrinking of  and often described as the the     the American middle class There are questions about what people might call the middle classes  but there is a clear picture in which median incomes and the quality of life of  the middle  in the US is moving in   At the same time   abound about the  rich getting richer   along with rafts of figures supporting this point  That this is taking place is unsurprising  if there is a massive increase in supply of one of the factors of production  then it should be expected that the price of the factor will go down  As labour prices have gone down  this in turn increases the potential for those with capital to make greater profits and those with capital reap the benefits of cheaper labour  A similar story can be found in the UK  where incomes have been described as being  squeezed  by the Governor of the Bank of England  sorry  no link  and reports of   People in the UK saw their incomes squeezed in 2010 11  despite a modest recovery in the wider economy  according to a new report  Data collated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies  IFS  has revealed that median household income fell by 3 1 per cent after accounting for inflation during this period  wiping out five years of minor growth within 12 months and setting income levels back to those seen in 2004 05  This represented the largest single year decline in income levels since 1981  with earnings falling across all parts of society  According to the IFS  these figures can be attributed to rising inflation and the delayed effect of trends seen during 2008 10 at the height of the recession  The situation in Europe is complicated by the Euro crisis  with the crisis an additional factor that is influencing the wealth of individual countries throughout the European Union  Nevertheless  the picture is one in which  for much of the EU  the economic situation can only be characterised as dire  The Euro crisis just complicates the picture  Perhaps the most interesting example in relation to my thesis are Australia and Sweden  which have largely  from the economic crisis that has been felt in the rest of the developed world  Unlike Britain  it is sometimes said  Australia and Sweden are advanced economies that have managed to get their public policy agenda broadly right  and as a consequence now reap the rewards  Both economies sailed through the credit crunch pretty much unscathed  unemployment is at or close to an all time low  and unlike so many other   rich   nations  public debt is under control  But while inspired policymaking has no doubt played its part  much more important is that both Australia and  to a lesser extent  Sweden are rich in natural resources  Sweden also has an abundance of relatively cheap hydroelectric power  The blessings of nature  not the brilliance of policymakers  offer the better explanation as to why these countries have done so well  Similar  can be told for other commodity rich economies such as Brazil and Russia  The success of these commodity rich economies are exactly what might be expected in the era of hyper competition  I have also  that the world economy would be dominated by commodity supply and prices  saying that  In an earlier post  I presented an analogy  I described commodities as a moving brick wall to growth  with the world economy running behind this wall of constraint  As the economy runs forwards  it hits the wall and tumbles backwards  The world economy then gets back on its feet  and once again runs towards the wall only to eventually bounce back again   sorry  I forget where I first wrote about this   This has been the pattern that has emerged since the world economy fell into crisis  But  it may be that the situation may be about to change  The first element that needs to be considered is the energy revolution that has resulted from  fracking   which has allowed an explosion in natural gas output  It is not a direct substitute for oil  with more limited uses  but it has changed the overall picture of energy supply  This is not to say that the constraints of oil supply have been removed but they have been ameliorated  However  this is nothing compared with the potential for the Chinese economy to  on the commodity situation  Sharma is heard with respect when he gives an opinion on something concerning emerging economies  At the same time  the commodity supercycle standing for a very long term surge in prices may or may not have run out of all its steam  Unarguably  bulk commodities and metals subject to stagnation in the two decades preceding 2000  subsequently started experiencing regular spikes in prices on the back of unprecedented demand growth in emerging markets  If China stood out for its ravenous appetite for raw materials  a big market opened up for their suppliers  benefiting emerging economies  like Brazil and Russia  In the beginning of the cycle  demand for raw materials was ahead of supply and buyers in China and India  for coking coal  were constrained to pay ever rising premium prices  Raw material price spikes left huge surpluses with the mining groups leading them to invest heavily in capacity expansion to take care of the world hunger for minerals  This is bringing about a balance in demand and supply and as a result  a southward push to prices of raw materials and collaterally to metals  Unlike Sharma  many others argue that rises and falls in commodity prices happen in waves lasting 20 years  If it is to be accepted that a supercycle has a life of 20 years  then there is no running away from the fact that halfway  the market is taking a hard look at slowdown in all emerging economies from where the bulls in the first place drew inspiration  The Chinese double digit growth rate is in the past and as the world s second largest economy is aiming at a soft landing  it grew at 7 6 per cent in the second quarter of this year  China has now lowered its 2012 growth target to 7 5 per cent from the earlier eight per cent  As for India  Moody s says the combination of a sharp and broad based slowdown  a poor monsoon and a government that has  badly lost its way  will restrict the country s growth at 5 5 per cent this year and six per cent in 2013  Growth deceleration in the two BRIC  Brazil  Russia  India and China  nations will set off a chain reaction  Fall in China s raw materials import growth rates in particular will be hurtful for resource rich and export dependent Brazil and Russia  Australia  a major supplier of a host of minerals to the world  is taking a hit because of a downturn in commodity prices  Retreat by bulls is also due to discouraging industrial output data from Euro zone countries  Their main concern is Europe s manufacturing hub Germany  which after sustaining growth through the European debt crisis is now feeling the impact of the Euro zone storm  No wonder the German manufacturing PMI in July was at its lowest for more than three years  Bulls are further disheartened by the Bank of England warning the UK economy would grind to a complete standstill and the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank refusing to introduce new stimulus packages  For a long time  I argued that China was playing its cards superbly  They played the developed world players off against each other  stole intellectual property  and used their currency in support of mercantilism trading policy  From the ravages of Maoism  when China commenced opening up to the world economy  the massive investments in infrastructure were easy  hits  for creating infrastructure with significant economic returns  However  even in my s  back in July 2008 I said the following  The first point is that it is quite possible that China has a construction bubble  Whilst I was in China I noted that there were lots of apartment blocks being built  and that it was very popular for these to be purchased by investors  In many cases the investors were leaving the apartments empty  Chinese people like to buy property brand new  once it has been lived in the value falls   and they were holding on to the apartments in an expectation of increases in value  In addition to this there has been a boom in the construction of shopping malls  and I noted that they were already  back in January  starting to exceed demand  If the Chinese economy is pulled back due to world demand for exports dropping  it is likely that such investments will lead to a bust  It is also worth considering the state of the Chinese banks  If they are lending into construction in this way  will there be a repeat of the previous Chinese bad lending problems of a few years ago  What other bad lending is buried in their books  Set against this is that the finances of the Chinese government are very healthy  as are the levels of savings in China  The real question with China is how much their continued growth is reliant on exports  and how much growth can be sustained within China  I will readily admit that I am not sure on this at all  I am not sure that anyone is  My best guess is that China will also hurt  and hurt badly  with a significant potential for civil unrest as a result  The final paragraph  I was wrong  and China did pull through and in part because of the spending binge of the developed economy governments maintaining demand  However  it is now four years later  and the situation I described with housing and other real estate was indeed taking place  but no bust took place  Analysts have recognised what I saw on the ground all those years ago  and have similarly been predicting a bust in the last couple of years  That bust may  or may not be in motion now  but the curious question is why it was that the bust has been evaded so long  The answer is simple  the Chinese have nowhere else to put their money  except for the casino Chinese stock market  in state bank accounts with pitiful returns  or in places like Wenzhou in very dubious private corporate lending  With regards to the finances of the Chinese government  they still remain relatively healthy  but only if you discount the provincial and local government  A combination of corruption and ineptitude has seen large investments being made in construction projects  in preferred state companies  and real estate  The result is massive investments in capital projects  including dubious infrastructure projects and real estate  As time has moved forwards  the easy investment  hits  have diminished  and the result increasingly dubious investments  These investments are  in turn  linked into the state banking system  which will undoubtedly be sitting on low grade debt that will sour at some point in the future  In a previous post  I have detailed the cities being built with no people to live there  and this is just a very visible tip of a large iceberg  The Chinese government sought to engineer a soft landing from the real estate boom  restricted credit  and the result may be a hard landing  I mentioned Wenzhou earlier  as it is the exemplar of how this tightening of credit led to a big bust in the private  grey  credit markets  the limited access to credit in the state banks fed into a bust for many of the unregulated private lenders  often with horrendous results for small investors  However  in the face of dramatic drops in growth  the restraints on credit have been pulled  and a new round of large capital investments has been unleashed  The problem is that the re loosening of the credit taps will see more malinvestment  It may  or may not  be too late to reverse a bust  The problems that are taking place in China are likely to be exacerbated by the problems of the EU economies weakening demand for goods  and the so called    in the US   is moving to quash the threat of a government shutdown  but the prospect of a one two punch of tax increases and slashing  automatic spending cuts will still confront lawmakers when they return to Washington after Election Day  The House on Thursday passed a six month stopgap spending bill to keep federal agencies running past the end of the budget year  the elections and into the spring  It effectively scratched a major item off of   to do list heading into a potentially brutal postelection  lame duck session  The bipartisan 329 91 House vote for the measure sent it to the   which is expected to clear it next week for  s signature  capping a year of futility and gridlock on the budget despite a hard fought spending and deficit reduction deal last summer  Nobody can predict at this stage how the  fiscal cliff  will play out  If it does kick in  the US economy is likely to be hit hard  and this may explain the feds renewed bout of printing money  it is front running the potential fallout from the fiscal cliff  In the meantime  the mess of the Euro continues to stagger forwards with compromise and delay  but with no real resolution  It is a crisis that simply refuses any resolution  It is almost becoming dull to watch the back and forth between crisis  and temporary bouts of market relief  As time goes forwards  it becomes ever more apparent that we are watching King Canute seeking to turn back the tide  We are just left with the hanging question of when and how the tide might finally overwhelm the desire that it be held back   The problem is that  if China really does go into reverse  this will have knock on effects in the countries that have been sheltered from the economic crisis through the commodities super cycle  The new bout of investment may just lift the Chinese economy enough to keep the economy from a bust  but it is far from certain in the face of wider economic headwinds  There are some things which remain resolutely unchanged  The global  too big to fail  banks still sit like time bombs within the global financial system  but post crisis are even more  too big to fail   Although there have been vague and weak attempts to address some of the problems of these banks  central banks continue to support bust banks  and do whatever is needed to shore up the banking system  As I have discussed in previous posts  parts of the EU bailouts have been directed towards shoring up insolvent banks  and in return the insolvent banks have propped up insolvent governments  It is the same story I have discussed previously  banks are magic entities which are the foundations of economies  Somewhere along the way  the regulators and politicians lost sight of the purpose of banks as a support for the rest of the economy  and now the rest of the economy is a support for the banks   Then there is the government borrowing  In the developed economies  the debts of governments just keep on growing  Whether financed through the printing presses  or financed through dubious credit lines of central banks  developed world governments just keep on borrowing and spending  The poster boy for the borrowing and spending approach is  in my view  the UK  they proclaim austerity whilst continuing to borrow and spend at astonishing levels  I am not going to discuss this subject in detail  as the blog is replete with discussions of individual economies  and general principles  However  I will re emphasise that this is a prolonging of the problems of the developed world  The shift in the world economy represented by the labour supply shock was hidden by huge expansion in credit  This allowed the diminishing levels of wealth in the developed world to be hidden for a while  Even though less wealth was being generated  lifestyles were maintained as if wealth generation was increasing  The  financial crisis  was simply the  bust  of this paradigm  and the developed world governments replaced the private credit growth with government credit growth  What the governments failed to recognise was that the private credit growth had restructured their economies to service credit growth  and that they are retaining that structure through the use of government borrowing  In the end  credit growth cannot be sustained forever  and any structure built upon ongoing credit growth must eventually collapse   The point is this  the great labour supply shock has taken place  It is there in front of our eyes  It is not possible for the entire world economy to become richer if the rate of labour entry exceeds the increase in the rate of available commodities  It is a situation further complicated by the resource intensive growth in infrastructure needed to grow a developing economy  but it is a simple and logical formulation  If 10 people share access to 10 litres of oil  each can have a litre  If the number of people increases to 15  and the available oil only increases to 12 litres  it is not possible for each person to have a litre  What then happens is that those who want a litre of oil  as they had before  must compete intensively with the newcomers if they want to keep their oil  The newcomers  unsurprisingly  would also like to have a litre of oil  Welcome to hyper competition  It is a situation which is now being recognised  This from a  in the Telegraph  In his seminal study of business cycles  the Austro Hungarian economist  Joseph Schumpeter  explained these long   or Kondratieff   cycles as the natural result of particularly high periods of technological innovation  This seems plausible  even though the latest phase of innovation is of course mainly about communications  little if any of which originated in China  Modern communications has none the less reduced Western advantage in many commodity industries to virtually zero  The major beneficiary has so far been China  where dissemination of Western technology and globalisation of trade has driven a remarkable economic transformation  Western economies have in a sense shot themselves in the foot  Their own innovation has made them relatively less competitive and therefore less well off than they used to be  One of the manifestations of this shift is that we have to pay a lot more for our commodities   be it food  oil or metals   than we used to  Speculation  Western money printing and ultra low interest rates have turbo charged the bubble  But even assuming that China avoids the much feared hard landing  there is good reason for believing the present super cycle may already have peaked  The iron ore price has fallen nearly 40pc in the past year alone  As in 2008 09  the fall may be a blip  but equally  it may a presage a much needed shift in the composition of Chinese economic growth away from commodity intensive investment and capital accumulation to consumption  China s investment and export orientated model is proving just as unsustainable as the West s consumption driven approach to growth  China knows it must change if it is to keep growing  There s no relief to be had from once buoyant Western export markets  People are starting to get it  It was never a financial crisis for the developed world   it was a fundamental economic crisis   a shock that was buried in a credit make believe  All the actions of policymakers and governments  including politicians and central banks in particular  has been a pretense that 12 divided by 15 can equal 1  The response has been to hide from the reality that the figures just do not add up  We have seen the Chinese economic miracle  and to a lesser extent the other emerging economies  dominate the shape of the world economy  Rather than confront the challenge that was represented by this new challenge  the answer was to pretend that all could go on as before  Rather than adapt to the new and emerging reality  the answer was to preserve the structures of another time  even though they were increasingly impossible to maintain  In trying to preserve the existing economic structure  the policy response has been to create a new world in which governments are now in the driving seat of markets  are now taking an ever larger role in the economic activity of the world  and consuming ever greater proportions of the available resources  This action is supposed to  save  the world economy  But is is not  In the developed world  most people are getting poorer and poorer  Even as governments grow their debts ever larger and larger  people are still getting poorer  And those debts must one day be repaid  Then there is the money printing  and the market sugar rush that follows each bout of printing money  I reported on an analyst s view of this some time ago  His advice  invest when money is printed  and get out before the effects wear off  In other words  the markets are no longer about underlying economic drivers  but are responses to policy actions alone  It is hardly a basis for future economic growth  The same analyst gave five years of this paradigm before it all collapses horribly  And then there are the banks  Protected at all costs  wealth flows from the rest of the economy into the banks  Every bout of money printing helps them  they get access to capital for the carry trade  So far  they remain as the winners  albeit with some ups and downs  In the new paradigm  they are protected at the cost of everyone else  The economy now services the interest of the banks  not the banks servicing the interests of the economy   For me  this is how I see the world economy  In some respects  it is a rambling discourse  However  there is a theme running through  Something changed  and there was a failure to respond  Something is changing now  The miracle of China is running its course  and there is a turning point  I am not predicting an immediate economic bust but rather that the corruption and ineptitude of the Chinese system is now starting to overwhelm the raw potential that was unleashed with the reforms of Deng Xiao Ping  This might have been an opportunity for a resurgence of the developed economies  However  when looking at the state of the developed economies resultant from the policies of the last few years  it is not clear that there is the foundation for a resurgence  That is the tragedy of the last few years  We are now at an inflection point  and the developed economies may be too weak to respond ,2012-09-16,Mark

24588,246103,COHR,Debt And Obesity In The United States,opinion,The waistline bubble began to expand at just about the same time as the debt bubble First  it s important emphasise that correlation is not causation   more than 99  of murderers have consumed water in the twenty four hour period preceding a murder  But it is clear that the effects of globalisation are at play in both cases  simply because globalisation has transformed the American economy    far fewer Americans have to do physically demanding manufacturing work   there are far more calories per American available to consume  The interesting difference between debt and obesity is that while it is possible from historical evidence to construct a fairly coherent model linking excess outgrowth in debt with recession and depression   for example  I conjecture that a depression becomes inevitable when debt service cost growth consistently outpaces income growth   there is no such historical evidence available for obesity  because there has never in known world history been an obesity epidemic of such proportion  so there is no way to know how the obesity bubble may burst  To what extent do the healthcare overheads of an obesity epidemic act as a drag on economic growth     147 billion  How much of a drag on the real economy is supporting those who have dropped out of the labour force due to obesity related illness like diabetes  fatigue  depression and cardiovascular illness  Well  we know that in the years that obesity has been exploding  that the disabled proportion of the workforce has almost tripled That s  receiving Federal disability   almost six million more than we would have if the number of those receiving Federal disability was proportionate to the numbers at the beginning of the Ford administration  And if each disabled worker was contributing the per capita average of  46 546 to GDP  the US would be producing roughly  279 billion more output  Even if only half of the increase is associated with obesity  a very  very  very conservative estimate  that equates to around  140 billion of lost output  That   especially when considered next to the healthcare costs   is a pretty big gap  and that does not even begin to consider that the obese workers not on disability   So to what extent has the debt acquisition been an attempt to paper over the cracks of an economy increasingly losing productivity due to obesity and obesity related illness  and to what extent is obesity linked to the current American employment and growth weakness  Well  we know that it is possible to blow up a huge debt bubble without a high level of obesity   for the last twenty years without any associated obesity epidemic  and because the Great Depression was preceded by a huge outgrowth in debt  but no such outgrowth in obesity  And certainly  the United States lives with far greater burdens than the effects of obesity   for example  the quantifiable burden of invading and occupying Iraq and Afghanistan  than the quantifiable burden of growing national obesity This is not to mention the effects of job migration  maintaining a global empire with bases in over 150 countries  and bailing out Wall Street banks  Debt has been a means to paper over the cracks of lost productivity and an American empire living far beyond the means of its productivity   but there is far more to that than just the outgrowth in obesity  But obesity is causing a significant output loss  which by definition contributes to the wider problems ,2012-10-24,John Aziz,https://www.investing.com/analysis/debt-and-obesity-in-the-united-states-141020,141020
24589,246104,COHR,Gold And Silver Movements Restricted Amid Election Uncertainty ,opinion,Gold futures have bounced up from the lows of around  1700 but it is too early to tell yet if the October correction is finally over  It s a lack of follow through on the downside for Gold prices  The inability for Gold prices to break cleanly below  1 700 might have been the result of physical buyers who were absent at higher prices and also the futures traders who booked gains around  1800 and are now returning to the market  Precious Metals and Commodity Markets have overreacted to the downside  when one considers the massive and multiple central bank stimulus programs recently announced and some more in the near future pipeline  Most commodity prices and especially Gold  Silver and Base Metals are now at or near support levels and are ready to move up once they get a good momentum trigger  Cautious  range bound trading may remain the trend for the gold and silver market for the entire week and there are now 5 trading days left until the US Presidential elections on November 6th after which some measure of the uncertainty will be lifted  The most important economic report this week will be the U S  employment data for October  which comes out November 2  It will also be the last jobs report before the US Presidential Election  Consumer spending and consumer confidence reports are also expected over the week Sandy Shuts US Markets  US markets remain closed today  moving to protect workers as Hurricane Sandy barreled toward New York City with 70 mile per hour winds and the threat of an 11 foot sea surge  The shutdown  announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission  may extend through tomorrow also  Risks posed by the storm  expected to come ashore late today in southern New Jersey and potentially affect 60 million people  were deemed too great to require workers to travel  CME Group Inc  said it will halt stock index futures and options at 9 15 am New York time  Gasoline rose as Hurricane Sandy threatened U S  East coast refineries Gold Holdings at all time high  The positive U S  GDP report announced last week has meant improved risk sentiment and the recent pullback in Gold Prices has attracted physical demand and investor buying  With this GDP report  it s been 13 months that the economy has actually expanded  Gold market traders are again getting to be the most bullish in three weeks as investors  bullion holdings rose to a record on Friday 26   2012  Investors boosted holdings in exchange traded products to an all time high of 2 585 1 metric tons  valued at  142 4 billion  data compiled by Bloomberg show  Hedge funds  bets on a rally are near the biggest in more than a year  according to U S  CFTC   Commodity Futures Trading Commission data  Central banks from Europe to China to the U S  have pledged to do more to boost economies  The yen reached a four month low versus the US dollar this week on speculation the Bank of Japan  8301  will further expand stimulus and the Federal Reserve said it plans to continue buying bonds  A QE4 can be expected from the US Federal Reserve or an expansion to the QE3 when Operation Twist finishes in two months by December end  The BOJ  which holds a policy meeting October 30  will consider raising its asset purchase program by 10 trillion yen   125 billion  to 90 trillion yen  the Nikkei newspaper reported  Inflation expectations measured by the break even rate for five year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities jumped 33  this year and reached a 16 month high in September  Gold ETP holdings gained 7 9  since the end of July and now account for almost a year of mine production Brazil Central Bank raises Gold Reserves  Central banks have been expanding bullion reserves to diversify from currencies  Nations may add almost 500 tons this year  the London based World Gold Council said in August  Brazil raised its Gold Bullion reserves last month for the first time since December 2008 and countries from South Korea to Russia increased holdings this year  International Monetary Fund data show  Brazil increased its Gold Reserves for the first time since December 2008 at a time when investors raised holdings in exchange traded products to a record Brazil s Gold Holdings expanded 1 7 tons last month to 35 3 tons Turkey s Gold holdings increased 6 8 tons and Ukraine added 0 3 ton  If a central bank like Brazil decides to enter the Gold Markets  it will keep buying for a longer time horizon until an optimal share of Gold holdings to total asset is reached and a constant demand like these is highly Gold Price supportive Silver Prices will rise higher even after Gold rally weakens  With the uncertainty over the outcome  the US Presidential election has many investors on the sidelines  Gold will be supported by and likely see gains into year end due to the coming uncertainty surrounding the US  fiscal cliff   For more details read   Fiscal Cliff gets into Focus   Tax increases and spending cuts are expected which would sink the US economy into a deep recession or a Depression  If US Congress cannot agree on a deal by the end of the year it could have deleterious effects on the dollar and on capital markets  Stormy volatility may be seen soon after the election when the reality of the appalling US fiscal and monetary situation is realized  China could become more aggressive in stimulating its economy with the new government in place at the end of the first quarter  Given the extremely bullish fundamentals for Inflation triggered due to ultra loose monetary policies  negative fiscal outlooks  negative real interest rates and global currency debasement  we expect this November and year end to be very positive for Gold and particularly the still highly undervalued Silver  The rational and prudent investors should ideally use the current dips in Gold and Silver prices to enter fresh buy positions as both may soon rise with extreme volatility  especially Silver  Investment demand should support silver  as it benefits from higher Gold prices  and may benefit the most from loose monetary policy and a rebound in risk appetite  The rally in Silver will extend higher even after the Gold rally weakens  A Rally in Base Metals and Silver is what seems the most likely outcome of the ultra lose monetary policy adopted by several central banks  With Gold already not far below its lifetime peak  the best alternate avenues are Silver and then the Base Metals complex with Copper riding the sector  Price out performance more likely to come from those supply constrained metals such as Copper and Lead  Accommodative monetary policy should provide support but the upside is limited by subdued demand in a sub par economy  Weaker consumer demand will later hurt the industrial use of silver  while high prices then will reduce its demand as a jewelry material  Silver and Gold would then see sharp declines  though there is a long time to go for that to occur How Ben Bernanke Is Destroying Americaby David Einhorn David Einhorn presents one of the most coherent explanations why QE  contrary to the Chairman s  best intentions  does nothing to stimulate the economy at the consumer level  and why it effectively serves as a hindrance to future growth  Sometimes you have to look at what is the base assumption  Because sometimes you have a group think around the base assumption and everybody agrees to the same thing and acts reflexively and doesn t really challenge what is going on  I think we have reached that point with the monetary policy  The assumption is that if you want the economy to improve  if you want more jobs  if you want more consumption  what we need is ever easing monetary policy  It gets to a point where it s not a question of diminishing returns but it actually turns out to be a drag I think we have passed the point where incremental easing of Federal policy actually acts as a headwind to the economy and is actually slowing down our recovery  and I am alarmed by the reflexive group think of the leaders which is if we want a stronger economy  we need lower rates  we need more QE and other such measures Lower rates drive up the cost of commodities  Oil and food  And money that is spent on oil is sent out of the country to the Mideast and it doesn t help  and takes out income from people s pockets that could otherwise be spent on other goods  The second is that not being able to earn a safe return on savings  is causing people to hoard savings rather than consume In other words if I know I am going to earn 3  in the bank I can spend that income and I can have visibility towards that  but if I know I m going to earn zero in the bank  in order to figure out how much I need to save for retirement I need to save a much bigger number  Which means I can t spend much now  I need to save more now  to build up those savings for retirement If I am already retired and I am on fixed income  my income has now really gone down and I have to hoard money so I can spread it out thinner over a longer part of my life  So by denying individuals savings or interest on income on their savings  it is causing hoarding which is driving down consumption which is hurting the economy It seems as if nothing will stop the money printing and Chairman Bernanke in fact assures us that it will continue even after the economic recovery strengthens  Specifically  he says   Even after the economy starts to recover more quickly  even after the unemployment rate begins to move down more decisively  we re not going to rush to begin to tighten policy   Apparently  anything less than a  40 billion per month subscription order for MBS is now considered  tightening   He s letting us know that what once looked like a purchasing spree of unimaginable proportions is now just the monthly budget  Chairman Bernanke concedes that this policy hurts savers  then offers some verbal sleight of hand worthy of a three card monte hustle  He says the savers are helped by low rates because low rates support higher asset values and promote a healthy and growing economy  He then goes on to say that because savers benefit from a healthy and growing economy  we must therefore have an accommodative policy This in turn begs the question  Does an accommodative policy promote a healthy economy  Chairman Bernanke argues that higher asset values create a wealth effect  which he again describes   if people feel that their financial situation is better because their 401 k  looks better or for whatever reason  their house is worth more  they are more willing to go out and spend   We have just spent 15 years learning that a policy of creating asset bubbles is a bad idea  so it is hard to imagine why the Fed wants to create another one  But perhaps the more basic question is  How fruitful is the wealth effect  Is the additional spending that these volatile paper profits are intended to induce overwhelmed by the lost consumption of the many savers who are deprived of steady  recurring interest income  We have asked several well known economists who publicly support the Fed s policy and found that they don t have good answers  If Chairman Bernanke is setting distant and hard to achieve benchmarks for when he would reverse course  it is possibly because he understands that it may never come to that  Sooner or later  we will enter another recession  It could come from normal cyclicality  or it could come from an exogenous shock  Either way  when it comes  it is very likely we will enter it prior to the Fed having  normalized  monetary policy  and we ll have a large fiscal deficit to boot  What tools will the Fed and the Congress have at that point  If the Fed is willing to deploy this new set of desperate measures in these frustrating  but non desperate times  what will it do then  We don t know  but a large allocation to Gold still seems like a very good idea ,2012-10-30,Commodity Trade Mantra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-and-silver-movements-restricted-amid-election-uncertainty-141672,141672
24590,246105,COHR,September Business Inventories  Sales Have Recessionary Whiff,opinion,Econintersect s analysis of final business sales data  retail plus wholesale plus manufacturing  for September 2012 is not as good as the headline data  business sales remain in a long term downtrend The inventory levels have been slightly on the high side for three months   but is not sending any warning signals This is a record current dollar month for sales   with a record sales in 13 of the last 14 months  Note that real  inflation adjusted  dollars are used in GDP  and the headlines are not

between the business releases pumped out by the U S  Census Bureau are not easy to understand with a quick reading  The entire story doesn t really come together until the Business Sales Report  this report  comes out  At this point  a coherent and complete business contribution to the economy can be understood   Today  Econintersect analyzed advance retail sales for October 2012  That is early data for the month after the data for this post  This is final data from the Census Bureau for September 2012 for manufacturing  wholesale  and retail Year over Year Change Manufacturing New Orders   Unadjusted  blue line  and Inflation Adjusted  red line Year over Year Growth   Wholesale Sales   Unadjusted data  blue line    Inflation Adjusted Data  red line Year over Year Change   Unadjusted Retail Sales  blue line  and Inflation Adjusted Retail Sales  red line  The Headlines Sales  The U S  Census Bureau announced today that the combined value of distributive trade sales and manufacturers  shipments for September  adjusted for seasonal and trading day differences but not for price changes  was estimated at  1 263 9 billion  up 1 4 percent   0 2   from August 2012 and up 4 4 percent   0 4   from September 2011   Inventories  Manufacturers  and trade inventories  adjusted for seasonal variations but not for price changes  were estimated at an end of month level of  1 612 9 billion  up 0 7 percent   0 1   from August 2012 and up 6 2 percent   0 4   from September 2011   Inventories Sales Ratio  The total business inventories sales ratio based on seasonally adjusted data at the end of September was 1 28  The September 2011 ratio was 1 25   Please see caveats at the end of this post on the differences between Econintersect data analysis methodology and U S  Census  Business Sales   Unadjusted     millionsThis is a record current dollar month for sales   with a record sales in 13 of the last 14 months Inflation adjusted business sales have been quite noisy but sales are in a down trend  This month shows a year over year contraction Year over Year Change Business Sales   Unadjusted  blue line  and Inflation Adjusted  red line Using inflation adjustments  analysts can more clearly count the quantity of business transactions  Inflation adjusted data being negative is telling that real sales are contracting and could be a recession flag Many analysts pay particular attention to inventories in this report  Inventories  expressed as a ratio to sales  remain well within the historical levels  A unusual rise in this ratio would suggest the economy was contracting Business Inventories Year over Year Change   Inventory Value  blue line  and Inventory to Sales Ratio  red line The takeaway from the above graph is that overall inventories growth is  less good   but business sales are even more  less good  as the inventory to sales ratios have a slight growth bias  Admittedly  this is slight upward bias in the inventory to sales ratios is so slight that it is statistically insignificant The above graph is the headline view of inventories  Econintersect uses unadjusted data to look at inventories  To do so  you need to compare ONLY the data results in the month of the data release   and DO NOT compare one month against another  A high ratio is good if you are looking for recession evidence Unadjusted Inventory to Sales RatioCaveats On Business Sales This data release is based on more complete data than the individual releases of retail sales  wholesale sales and manufacturing sales  Backward revisions are slight   and it is unusual that the revisions would cause a different interpretation of a trend analysis  The data in this series is not inflation adjusted by the Census Bureau   Econintersectadjusts using the appropriate BLS price indices relative to the three data series CPI less shelter for retail salesPPI subindex OMFG for manufacturingPPI subindex PCUAWHLTRAWHLTR for wholesale salesAs in most U S  Census reports  Econintersect questions the seasonal adjustment methodology used and provides an alternate analysis  The issue is that the exceptionally large recession and subsequent economic roller coaster has caused data distortions that become exaggerated when the seasonal adjustment methodology uses more than one year s data  Further  Econintersect believes there is a New Normal seasonality and using data prior to the end of the recession for seasonal analysis could provide the wrong conclusion ,2012-11-15,Steven

24591,246106,COHR,If You Want To Be Well Off In Life,opinion,I write this because it should be obvious but is not  I grew up in a house where my Dad earned an average income from his business  but my Mom took around 10  of the income and invested it half in utilities and half in growth stocks  As my Mom said to me   My utilities are my bonds  Bright lady  my first teacher in investing  She beat the market for four decades plus But the main thing that she did right was to spend less than my Dad earned  This is critical  You can t build capital unless you set assets aside  This is the most important of the rules  You must consume below your means  and invest the surplus wisely  I remember many ways in which she said  no   to a variety of expenditures  We didn t live below the appearances of our neighbors  but we were one of the last on the block to get a color TV  Good thing  TV is such a waste of time   and I wasted a lot of time there when I was a kid The second main thing that she did right was take moderate risk  Looking at her portfolio  one might ask   Why so many utilities   Or comment   A lot of boring GARP y stocks   I contrast her with my paternal grandfather  who retired in 1966 7  and sold his business to his two sons  and then lived off the interest income from CDs  etc  He took no risk in his retirement  though he took moderate risk as a businessman  and as a pool player   Rumor is he was Wisconsin state champ at some point  but I can t prove that  I played him a kid  and never won  My Dad  who learned from him  I beat only once  and lost many times to him  An investor in CDs will get what he contracted for  absent default  The investor who is like my Mom will have a more jagged trail  but will earn more  Even in the late 70s and early 80s  my Mom did not lose confidence in her strategies  even as Grandpa earned 15  year on his CDs  Her time was yet to come My Mom would hold stocks for 10 years on average  So long as you pick companies with a sustainable competitive advantage  you will generally do well over longer periods  should you have the fortitude to not trade frequently So  my third point is don t be an aggressive trader  Yes  have trading rules  but don t try to make money in the short run  Try to make money in the long run My fourth point would be  do it yourself  if you can   Yes  I know I run money for others  I will say what I believe even if it costs me business   But that means you have to learn a lot  like my mom  or me  or my father in law  three people all mostly self taught  with different investing philosophies  Good investing is like running a business on the side  It is not easy My fifth point is pay attention to taxes  but don t let taxes dominate your decisions  There s a balance here  and for my clients  I try to generate taxable losses on net  while letting winners run My sixth point would be that income in investing is important  but not for the reason you might expect  Income is important because it motivates reinvestment opportunities  not consumption opportunities  When you are older this changes a little  but in many cases it is smarter to focus on total return  and consume from capital rather than have every stock try to produce income  That said stocks that pay dividends tend to do better than those that don t  28 of the 33 stocks in client portfolios  of which I am a client as well  at present pay dividends  and the portfolio as a whole has an above market dividend  Reinvesting income compounds your gains in new ideas that were hopefully more promising in the new environment The seventh point is study investing to the point where you have an intelligent strategy  and once you have that  don t abandon it  Too many people flit from one hot idea to another  but never end up with a coherent strategy that that employ for decades  Even if I close down my investment business  I will keep applying the same investment strategy for myself  it has worked well for me  even if at present it has been middling for clients Every investment strategy goes through periods where it works poorly  That s life  If you have a strategy that always works well  that means You haven t run it long enough You re not running enough money You re not taking enough risk Survive through your bad times  and prosper during the times where your intelligent strategy is paying off  Patience is a virtue in investing for the most part Okay  there are seven points from my experience  from my Mom  and from my late Father in law  None of us trained to invest in a formal way  myself included   Yes  I received a CFA Charter  but I knew far more than the syllabus did before I took the exams  The academic stuff I learned was not a help when I was in graduate school  An eighth point to consider is that money matters temporally  Eternally  no  it doesn t matter  No one can buy Heaven  as Psalm 49 points out  But you can use your wealth to aid those who are trying but failing  That s important  As John Wesley put it   Earn all you can  save all you can  give all you can   I am fairly certain that the first two were honored more than the last one  but Wesley was correct there In general  being willing to give also correlates with prosperity  Doing well means more than becoming rich  it means living your life for the good of others  We should not live for ourselves  Money is merely a means  it is not an end in itself  Use your money to the best end that you see  Loan money to a poor but honest friend at no interest  You will do something really good there  and God will bless you  I have done that many times in my life  and it has paid off  though I can t prove that empirically One more note  when you are a giver  you become more careful with your own spending  You begin thinking more broadly about the world  and realize there is little advantage to most luxuries  If you have enough  good  Even Warren Buffett  No Christian he  likes his Burgers and his Pepsi  He does not look to luxury in consumption  even as he owns jewelry stores He is a bit of a miser  but as he has aged  he has handed over most of his wealth to the Gates Foundation In closing  take care over your saving  investing and giving  They are all important aspects of how those who are improving their financial well being improve their lives

24592,246107,COHR,What Happens After The Santa Claus Rally ,opinion,This market has a deja vu feeling to it  This time last year  it was faced with the prospect of Eurogeddon  This year  it s the fiscal cliff  Regular readers know that I believe that we will likely see a Santa Claus rally  see Risk on  and Waiting for a Santa Claus rally   The most likely scenario is a relief rally based on a benign resolution of the much overhyped fiscal cliff  As I look forward into 2013  the more pressing issue becomes one of what happens after the relief rally An earnings cliff  The biggest risk to US equities is what termed an  earnings cliff   which he wrote about in late October  He was seeing signs of stalling earnings growth from large cap multi nationals  listen to this  with him   of CIBC explained Ritholz s  earnings cliff  thesis in a more coherent manner  Gibson monitors ROEs and how their components change over time  remember the    He found that the profitability of companies most exposed to the global economy were deteriorating  while domestically exposed companies were doing fine  emphasis added   This is where the difference between the U S  domestic economy and the global economy becomes critically important and where the issues surrounding the fiscal cliff and tax policy are critical  Simply put  our calculations of the rate of change in S P 500 corporate profitability suggest that the U S  economy  like all others  is slipping back into recession  but  that is not exactly correct  In fact  if we segregate the S P 500 companies that tend to be larger multinationals with the majority of their revenues coming from international sources from the predominately domestically focused S P 500 companies  then the contrast is striking  In the U S   the  international  companies are demonstrating a significant rate of ROE decline that would clearly be consistent with a recession  This would also be consistent with the state of the global economy  The  domestic  companies  however  are recording a slight growth in profitability  This  domestic  growth rate is dramatically different than the decline in  international  company profitability but it is not yet enough to suggest that the U S   domestic  economy is growing at a self sustaining rate  This  domestic  recovery is also consistent with the evidence of a recovery in U S  housing prices  Investors must be careful  however  in their view of a U S  housing recovery since the high level of structural unemployment tends to argue against a sustainable recovery in housing  as compared with  a recovery due to deeply depressed prices and very low interest rates  If the fiscal cliff  therefore  is not dealt with sensibly  then the tentative U S  domestic recovery will be lost as well  and then all bets are off  Whither Europe  With China in a tentative recovery  the source of global slowdown is coming from Europe  Indeed   and eurozone economies are in recession  The macro risk in 2013 is that economic weakness in Europe has the potential to drag down China  as Europe is China s biggest export market  which would create a domino effect around the world  While I understand the concerns expressed by Ritholz and Gibson  I remain cautiously constructive on the outlook for stocks  commodities and other risky assets in early 2013  I prefer to let the markets tell the story  Consider  for example  the chart of the Euro STOXX 50 below  If the eurozone economy is in such bad shape  why is this index rallying and challenging resistance at the old highs Why are industrial metals like copper rallying While I am aware of the risks of a European slowdown pulling down the rest of the world  and my views are subject to change   I don t see the  earnings cliff  to be a major headwind for equities going into 2013 at this time  However  with equities cheap on a relative basis against junk bonds and moderately expensive on an absolute basis  see my last post How cheap are stocks   two views    I can t say that I m wildly bullish either  I am only expecting modest upside for stocks in a hypothetical Santa Claus post fiscal cliff rally environment Disclosure  Cam Hui is

24593,246108,COHR,Heiko Ihle  How To Find Success With Latin American Miners,opinion,Miners in Latin America are facing both growth and challenges  Heiko Ihle  senior research analyst with Euro Pacific Capital  examines the factors behind these trends  In this Gold Report interview  Ihle urges investors to evaluate mining companies based on three important features rather than on the performance of others in the region  The Gold Report  Heiko  you cover many companies in Latin America  One silver miner in Mexico is challenging an eviction notice from its property in Chihuahua  Mexico  which is causing a stir in the mining industry  Does that give you cause to reevaluate Mexico as a mining jurisdiction or is this an isolated incident  Heiko Ihle  Mexico is a more challenging mining jurisdiction than the United States or Canada  but it s also a much easier place than Bolivia  for example  There are some common challenges with mining there  One of the companies I cover  Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM NYSE  FVI TSX  FVI BVL  F4S FSE   has some issues with the community in Oaxaca  This sort of thing happens all the time  and it s mostly business as usual  TGR  What sort of gold and silver prices are you using in your models to evaluate these companies  HI  I m a stock analyst  as opposed to a macroanalyst  so I use conservative numbers   1 600 ounce  oz  long term gold prices and  34 oz long term silver prices  In the long term  those numbers are likely to be a little too low  but they produce a margin of safety to our net asset value  NAV  and cash flow models  TGR  The silver companies you cover in Latin America are for the most part outperforming your gold companies  Does this make you more bullish on silver than gold  or are you evaluating specific cases and what those specific equities offer  HI  I look at specific cases because the best gold company can t prosper if it can t get gold out of the ground at a decent cash cost  Similarly  the best silver company won t flourish if a community demonstration shuts down its plant  Again  I am an individual equity analyst  I look at the microeconomic company specific factors and make my decisions accordingly  TGR  What are three must haves for the companies you cover  HI  The number one thing is good management  Bad management can run the best company into the ground  I ve seen it in stocks that I covered and in stocks that I owned  TGR  How do you quantify good management  HI  If I speak with a management team and I get the sense that it doesn t understand what s going on  then that would put it into the bad management category  If it continuously disappoints  if it continuously over promises and under delivers  that would put it into the bad management category  I worry  too  if there is no coherent team even if the CEO  CFO and chief geologist are great people  there is a chance that they do not work well together  It sounds simplistic  but I always pay close attention  TGR  What are the other must haves  HI  A company must have a good asset  Even if it has great management  if a company doesn t have a good asset  nothing s going to be pulled out of the ground  It needs to have a decent land package with room for expansion  The grades need to be right  The type of ore needs to be right  It needs to be permitted or have decent progress toward permitting  The third must have is a functional mill with potential for expansion  The chain is only as strong as its weakest link  and if one of these factors is broken  the whole system is going to crumble  I do a lot of site visits to evaluate the mills  I look for spare capacity  and I go through all the geological reports for permitting  TGR  Does that mean you re looking only at producers  HI  Not necessarily  I cover Romarco Minerals Inc   R TSX   It is still in the permitting phase  but it has made good progress toward a permit  it is so confident that it will get the permit that it already bought the ball mills  TGR  What is Romarco s production timeline  HI  The Army Corps of Engineers should let it know early next year  My gut feeling is that it will be in production in 2015  TGR  Let s move into your coverage of precious metals companies in the Americas  Aurizon Mines Ltd  s  ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE MKT  earnings per share were less than half of what they were in the same period a year prior  Q3 11  The company s cash costs rose to  759 oz in Q3 12 versus  497 oz in Q3 11  Nonetheless  you have a buy rating on Aurizon  HI  Yes  Aurizon is going through a transitional year  It is going through a shaft deepening at the Casa Berardi mine  Meanwhile  several other companies that can afford higher wages are poaching its workers  The shaft deepening frequently shuts down production at the site  and the same thing will happen in 2013  which is why my 2013 production numbers are lower  Cash costs are higher and may be even higher next year  when production will dip to 130 000 oz  However  this is temporary and ultimately will serve as an investment in the company s longer term growth  TGR  In a recent research report on Aurizon  you said you believed that  with about  200 million  M  in cash   the firm will engage in favorable M A activity   What sort of projects or targets is it likely to pursue  HI  Several projects in the area are in the  40 100M market cap range  Two in the same mining camp are fairly widely known  TGR  What is your 12 18 month target on Aurizon  HI  It is  5 20 share  TGR  Endeavour Silver Corp   EDR TSX  EXK NYSE  EJD FSE  had a strong Q3 12  with production increasing by about a third  You have a buy rating and a 12 month target price of  11 70 on the company  After such an impressive quarter  will there be room for more growth  HI  A good part of Endeavour s Q3 12 growth came from its recently purchased El Cubo mine in Mexico  That is where growth in 2013 and beyond should come from  the mine should produce 1 1 million ounces of silver next year  compared with about 400 000 oz this year  Endeavour also has some growth at Guanacevi and Bola itos  This growth should lead to more cash flow and potentially more acquisitions for the company  TGR  Endeavour bough El Cubo from AuRico Gold Inc   AUQ TSX  AUQ NYSE  in July  What were your thoughts when that transaction occurred  HI  I liked the acquisition  and I liked it even more after I visited earlier this year  when Endeavour took a number of analysts down for a site visit it really showed how much of a turnaround it has made  After it took over  Endeavour essentially doubled grades within six weeks because it started following the veins instead of randomly mining into the mountain and processing waste rock  I would expect Endeavour to have a good part of the transmission done next year  and my grades are improving for El Cubo as well  TGR  Considering its growth  do you think Endeavour will introduce a dividend  HI  No  It is more focused on growing the enterprise through more acquisitions  Endeavour has a very good track record for acquisitions  TGR  Yes  Endeavour has made a number of badly performing assets perform  HI  The day Endeavour closed on El Cubo  the NAV was already substantially above what it paid  TGR  You also cover Fortuna Silver Mines  which had a great Q3 12 and is poised to exceed its production guidance for 2012  Do you expect similar performance in 2013  HI  The company has good production numbers at its San Jose mine in Mexico  though there are community protests there  Offsetting that  however  is the Caylloma mine  which is in Peru  I visited it about a year ago  Labor costs are going through the roof at that site  so while production is very good  its cash costs have been rising more than everybody anticipated  The company should have a good 2013  but there will be some cash costs challenges  and it is already working on those  TGR  In a recent research report  you said Fortuna continues to search for midsized acquisitions in Central and South America  Given the difficulties it has faced at Caylloma and the mine s higher than anticipated labor costs  which juniors in Peru or nearby might be a good fit for Fortuna  HI  Fortuna is looking into private enterprise like smaller private mines that it can buy or privately owned land packages that it can attach to its mines  It probably will not buy a public junior company  TGR  What is it looking for  Is it looking to bring more feet into Caylloma  HI  Fortuna is looking for a separate project  which is what it should be doing because it diversifies risk  A good example is Aurizon  which has a single asset  Right now  that single asset is going through a tough time and that punishes the entire company  If a company has four assets and one goes through a tough time  it has much less impact  TGR  What is the next catalyst for Fortuna that will get it to your  6 60 share  12 18 month target price  HI  It needs to get cash costs under control  which it should be able to do once labor pressures subside  labor is the biggest factor  TGR  Is your  6 60 share target price a buy rating  HI  Yes  That is an upside from here  TGR  Great Panther Silver Ltd   GPR TSX  GPL NYSE MKT   on the other hand  had a poor Q3 12  Earnings per share were halved  and total revenues declined 6  year over year  You have a 12 month target of  2 20 share on the company  but it is trading around  1 60 share  What will push it higher  HI  Great Panther is also experiencing challenges  The droughts in Mexico this year forced it to stockpile ore because the mill wasn t able to take on the capacity  Meanwhile  some thought Endeavour would take over Great Panther because it was a logical target  However  since it took over El Cubo  there is less of a chance of Endeavour buying Great Panther  Revenues should grow nicely next year  I was disappointed by 2012 results year to date  and my price target has gone down as well  but the NAV discount remains  In the longer term  it should hopefully be able to get those assets  value  TGR  What is it trading at versus your NAV  HI  My NAV is at  1 80 share  The 20  premium gets rounded  that is  2 20 share  That consists of  1 44 share for Guanajuato and  0 22 share for Topia  which includes the drought issues  That is  249M for the overall company  including cash and exploratory assets and such  TGR  Rio Alto Mining Ltd   RIO TSX V  RIO BVL  operates the La Arena gold copper mine in Peru  and its share price has trended higher throughout most of 2012  Can investors expect further growth  HI  Yes  The second part of the company s project goes on line in a couple of years  and a lot of copper is being taken from the site  The stock should fare well  Rio Alto is also doing something many others wish they could do  which is growing through internal cash flow  so it doesn t have to dilute shareholders  It doesn t have to issue a lot of debt or equity  it is using the free cash flow from its first site and using that to grow  TGR  Could you give us an overview of Rio Alto  The company has done well this year  but it isn t widely known  HI  It owns La Arena  which is about 1 000 hectares  in Peru  It is a gold mine currently and a future gold and copper project  It has an approximately 26 000 hectare land package around there  and it currently produces from the La Arena oxide project  the gold project I just mentioned  That is open pit mining  and in about 2016  the sulfide project will come on line  That is where most of its cash is going right now  and at that point it will also produce copper at the site  TGR  When you met with management from Rio Alto  what stood out  HI  It has performed so far  and many companies in this space can t say that  CEO Alex Black is a good guy and the team he leads with CFO Tony Hawkshaw has delivered on everything it said it would  including time tables  grades and proper sales of the metal  It also got lucky this year  the grades from the site were at least temporarily higher than the company and all the analysts had thought they would be  TGR  You recently downgraded Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V  to neutral  What was your rationale  HI  That decision was due to valuation  The gold streaming business is still a good business  And I still like the company s management  which has achieved a lot in a short period  Right now  in a period of high gold prices and a fixed cash cost  many are selling gold for twice what it costs to take it out of the ground  It is a terrific business  Nonetheless  at some point  even the best business becomes fully valued  and I believe Rio Alto reached that point at  13 50 share  That is where it was when I downgraded it  Now the stock is a lot lower  it is trading around  11 50 share  TGR  The company has royalties on quite a suite of mines  This is a highly profitable business  given the margins and the tax considerations in Canada  but as more people catch on  will more companies enter this space  growing the competition for those royalties and shrinking the margins  HI  A lot of streaming agreements are like pawn shops  companies go there because they can t go anywhere else  That is what has held the industry s margins up  If everybody else were to come out and do the same thing  it could drive the companies  costs of funding a little lower but that won t happen  Also  a streaming company can err and invest in mines that never reach production only so many times until it is broke  Of course  there are more streaming companies now than there have ever been  and there are more juniors than before  too  All it takes is a project  a dream  an engineer and a geologist  TGR  The share price for Sandstorm Gold shot up and people made money  and now you say it has come back to earth  Is growth coming from the price of these commodities or how will a streaming company like Sandstorm grow from here  HI  The growth will come twofold  The mines it has streaming agreements on are going to enter production or grow production  that is one way to grow  A second way to grow is to issue more capital  which Sandstorm has done this year  and then use that to buy more streams in their infancy  TGR  Are you bullish on Colossus Minerals Inc  s  CSI TSX  COLUF OTCQX  Serra Pelada mine  in which Sandstorm has a royalty  and when that comes on  will it be a significant contributor to Sandstorm s revenue  HI  I don t follow Colossus  but I do feel good about that mine  I put out a report on it as well  TGR  What segment of the precious metals market is going to provide retail investors with the best bang for their buck in 2013  HI  I suggest people figure out what area they want to invest in  then narrow it down to a couple of companies  Go back to those three must haves that I mentioned  Look into management  look into the assets and look into the permitting and the operational phase of the firm  I

24602,246117,COHR,Market Discovers Tax Cliff  Sends Dollar Higher ,opinion,It had seemed that many participants were looking past the U S  fiscal cliff and were to be content taking on more risk  However  yesterday s late developments have provided a cold slap of reality  Our base scenario  under which the U S  does in fact go over the cliff appears more likely now that Speak Boehner s  Plan B  failed to draw sufficient Republican support to allow a vote  Indeed  there is some speculation that the failure of Boehner s gambit may see a leadership challenge right after the New Year   The lack of a coherent Republican strategy has prompted a large unwind of risk on and thin holiday market conditions may be exacerbating the price action  In the risk off mode  the U S  dollar and yen have performed best  The dollar bloc  which has generally lagged in recent days  remains under pressure   After approaching  1 06 last week  the Australian dollar approached  1 04 in Asia before finding a bid in Europe  Resistance is seen now near  1 0460  The greenback has moved above CAD0 9900 for the first time in two weeks and may close above its 20 day moving average for the first time in a month  The New Zealand dollar is the weakest of the three  It is off more than 1  on the day  It is off 2 cents on the week  With today s drop  the NZD has retracement nearly 61 8  of the rally from Nov 16 s   0 8065 to last week s high near  0 8475   The European currencies are faring better than the dollar bloc  Consider that the euro finished last week near  1 3165 and is now at pixel time above  1 32  For its part  sterling finished last week near  1 6175 and now is nearer  1 6240   There have been a few developments in Europe to note  First  the UK s Q3 GDP was revised slightly lower to 0 9  from 1 0   On a year over year basis  the UK economy was flat  Second  Italy s the passage of the 2013 budget and the balanced budget law will likely allow the dissolution of parliament over the next few days to allow for a late Feb election  Monti will deliver an end of the year address in which he is now expected to declare his intention to lead a centrist coalition  Monti appears more popular outside of Italy than within it  but securing 15 20  of the vote could still be decisive  In the mean time  Monti goes from un elected technocrat prime minister to caretaker   It is not Italy  Spain  or even Greece that is the most pressing case in Europe as the year winds down  but tiny Cyprus  As we have noted before  the focus is on the recapitalization needs of its banks  which overwhelm the government s finances  S P has slashed for the second time in two months to CCC  from B and maintains a negative outlook  ostensibly do to its reliance on short term financing   The key issue now is that the IMF reportedly is pressing for a restructuring of its debt  which means a private sector haircut  Cyprus may not be Greece and Greece may be unique  but it is difficult to see how Cyprus s debt situation can be put on sustainable footing without a restructuring of its debt  There is some talk of seeking Russia s assistance again  but this only adds to the country s debt burden  As the IIF s Tran notes the problem with the private sector burden sharing is that the creditors told that the Greek experience would not be repeated   Turning to Japan  the dollar has once again tested the JPY83 80 area for the third time in four days and it held  The modest gains in the yen appear to be largely a function of unwinding crosses against the dollar bloc  An LDP spokesperson noted that the BOJ s charter need not be modified if the BOJ capitulates  The BOJ governor  whose term ends in a few months  does not appear sympathetic to a 2  inflation target or open ended QE   We have suggested that open ended QE is more a way to market present the QE rather than substantive  The decision to buy foreign bonds lies with the Ministry of Finance not the central bank  Lastly  we note reports that the LDP does not want to trigger a large slide in the yen s value  but would be content for the dollar to trade in the JPY85 JPY90 range ,2012-12-21,Marc Chandler,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-discovers-tax-cliff,-sends-dollar-higher-148607",148607

24618,246133,COHR,Top 10 Energy ETFs,opinion,There are nearly 30 ETFs oriented to the energy sector  The following analysis features a fair representation of ETFs available  We believe from these investors may choose an appropriate ETF to satisfy the best index based and  enhanced  linked index offerings individuals and financial advisors may utilize The energy sector remains volatile and politically controversial given the recent higher spikes in prices in 2008 and 2011  In early 2012 the situation with Iran kept crude oil and some distillate prices high  Suddenly a confluence of events in early May took place that has shaken global equity markets throughout all sectors including energy Eurozone problems have bobbed to the surface once again  After the European Central Bank  ECB  along with others injected nearly  1 trillion to its problem members things seemed as though they were fixed  But the austerity requirements heaped on the public was rejected by them in various elections causing the euro alliance to perhaps crumble  Countries in Europe like the UK  France  Netherlands  Greece  Italy  Spain and most of Eastern Europe are either in recession or heading in that direction  This negatively impacts demand for energy  It has a contagion effect globally driving BRIC country equity markets lower and will eventually negatively impact U S  and other developed markets as well  The world is too interconnected for this not to occur Troubles with Iran can always reemerge to take center stage but for now they re at rest It s troubling the U S  hasn t had a coherent or effective energy policy since the Department of Energy was created by the Carter Administration over 30 years ago  The bottom line  more bureaucrats than energy with reliance and exposure to dangerous and unstable areas of the world  Easy monetary policies from central banks previously weakened the dollar which pushes commodity prices higher  but recently with eurozone in crisis the dollar has rallied driving prices lower  This has left energy sectors much weaker   We feature a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views  Simplistically  we recommend longer term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average  When prices are above the moving average  stay long  and when below remain in cash or short For traders and investors wishing to hedge  leveraged and inverse issues are available to utilize from ProShares and Direxion and where available these are noted KOL follows the Stowe Coal Index which provides exposure to companies that

have abandoned nuclear  In Japan and elsewhere the quick fix has been toward coal  This is dissatisfying to environmentalists but the utilities have little choice since natural gas production has been stymied  Wind and solar aren t at a level where they can produce enough power  The current U S  administration is not coal friendly which compounds the problem for this sector  You ll note in the

24647,246162,COHR,Stock Picking  Experts Vs  Dart Throwing Chimps,opinion,Daniel Kahneman  a professor of psychology at Princeton University  knows a few things about human behavior and decision making  and he has a Nobel Prize in Economics to prove it  We live in a complex world and our brains will often try to compensate by using shortcuts  or what Kahneman calls  heuristics  and  biases    in hopes of simplifying complicated situations and problems    When our brains become lazy  or we are not informed in a certain area  people tend to also listen to so called experts or pundits to clarify uncertainties  In the process of their work  Kahneman and other researchers have discovered something   experts should be listened to as much as monkeys  Frequent readers of this site understand my shared skepticism of the talking heads parading around on TV   Here is how Kahneman describes the reliability of professional forecasts and predictions in his recently published bestseller       People who spend their time  and earn their living  studying a particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart throwing monkeys who would have distributed their choices evenly over the options     Most people fall prey to this illusion of predictability created by experts  or this idea that more knowledge equates to better predictions and forecasts  One of the factors perpetuating this myth is the rearview mirror  In other words  human s ability to concoct a credible story of past events creates a false confidence in peoples  ability to accurately predict the future    Here s how Kahneman describes the phenomenon     The idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the ease with which the past is explained Our tendency to construct and believe coherent narratives of the past makes it difficult for us to accept the limits of our forecasting ability  Everything makes sense in hindsight  a fact financial pundits exploit every evening as they offer convincing accounts of the day s events  And we cannot suppress the powerful intuition that what makes sense in hindsight today was predictable yesterday  The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future   Even when experts are wrong about their predictions  they tend to not accept accountability  Rather than take responsibility for a bad prediction  Philip Tetlock says the errors are often attributed to  bad timing  or an  unforeseeable event   Philip Tetlock  a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania did a landmark twenty year study  which was published in his book Political Judgment  How Good Is It  How Can We Know   read excellent review in  did a landmark twenty year study  which was published in his book Expert    In the study Tetlock interviewed 284 economic and political professionals and collected more than 80 000 predictions from them  The results  The experts did worse than blind guessing    Based on the extensive training and knowledge of these experts  many of them develop a false sense of confidence in their predictions  Or as Tetlock explains it   They  experts  are just human in the end  They are dazzled by their own brilliance and hate to be wrong  Experts are led astray not by what they believe  but by how they think     Brain Blunders and Stock Picking   The buyer of a stock thinks the price will go up and the seller of a stock thinks the price will go down  Both participants engage in the transaction because they believe the current stock price is wrong  The financial services industry is built largely on this phenomenon that Kahneman calls an  illusion of skill   or ability to exploit inefficient market pricing  Relentless advertisements and marketing pitches continually make the case that professionals can outperform the markets  but this is what Kahneman found     Although professionals are able to extract a considerable amount of wealth from amateurs  few stock pickers  if any  have the skill needed to beat the market consistently  year after year  Professional investors  including fund managers  fail a basic test of skill  persistent achievement Skill in evaluating the business prospects of a firm is not sufficient for successful stock trading  where the key question is whether the information about the firm is already incorporated in the price of its stock  Traders apparently lack the skill to answer this crucial question  but they appear ignorant of their ignorance     For the few managers that actually do outperform  Kahneman assigns luck to the outcome  not skill     For a large majority of fund managers  the selection of stocks is more like rolling dice than like playing poker  Typically at least two out of three mutual funds underperform the overall market in any given year The successful funds in any given year are mostly lucky  they have a good roll of the dice     The picture for individual investors isn t any prettier  Evidence from Terry Odeam  a finance professor at UC Berkeley  who studied 100 000 individual brokerage account statements and about 163 000 trades over a seven year period  was not encouraging  He discovered that stocks sold actually did  3 2  better than the replacement stocks purchased  And this detrimental impact on performance excludes the significant expenses related to trading    In response to Odean s work  Kahneman states     It is clear that for the large majority of individual investors  taking a shower and doing nothing would have been a better policy than implementing the ideas that came to their minds  Many individual investors lose consistently by trading  an achievement that a dart throwing chimp could not match     In a future Odean paper titled   Trading is Hazardous to your Wealth   Odean and his colleague Brad Barber also proved that  less is more   The results showed the most active traders had the weakest performance  and those traders who traded the least had the best returns  Interestingly  women were shown to have better investment results than men    Regardless of whether someone is listening to an expert  fund manager  or individual investor  what Daniel Kahneman has discovered in his long  illustrious career is that humans consistently make errors  If you are wise  you will heed Kahneman s advice by stealing the expert s darts and handing them over to the chimp ,2012-07-09,Wade Slome,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-picking:-experts-vs.-dart-throwing-chimps-128929,128929

24649,246164,COHR,Fed Hits kill Switch On Liquidity,opinion,Lately investors have been worried about liquidity  specifically the central bank s willingness  or unwillingness  to continue providing it  and with good reason  Without periodic injections of liquidity  investors eventually lose interest as financial markets begin to languish  And in a financial economy like the U S   the death of a bull market means the death of the economic recovery Bull markets are to a large extent liquidity driven affairs  Without an abundance of excess monetary liquidity sloshing through the financial market  stocks and commodities have little hope of developing the necessary ingredient of forward momentum  Momentum is what attracts an ever growing number of investors to participate in a bull market  which in turn is what keeps the bull market going  When liquidity dries up  momentum perishes and investors quickly lose interest  This  in a nutshell  is how bull markets turn into bear markets  viz  the absence of liquidity  This week has seen two significant central bank meetings  the FOMC met on Wednesday while the ECB met today to discuss monetary policy  Both the U S  and European central banks disappointed investors who expected the banks to show their willingness to provide more monetary stimulus  The Dow Jones Industrial Average reacted to this disappointment by falling some 200 points  intraday  over the course of the last two days  The NYSE Broker Dealer Index  XBD   which is much more sensitive to future liquidity expectations  plummeted 9  since Wednesday s Fed meeting  The gold and silver stocks were also subject to the widespread investor disappointment and were down both Wednesday and Thursday  Although the damage has so far been fairly limited within the PM stock group  volatility among individual mining shares has been increasing since the central bank meetings  see HUI chart below  Bull markets typically begin with a massive dose of liquidity  just as they end whenever the liquidity stream dries up  The reason why an increasing number of market participants have been agitating for the world s leading central banks to amp up the liquidity is obvious  the U S  led global financial market recovery that began in 2009 appears to be slowly winding down according to a number of monetary indicators  One indication of how much liquidity has diminished in just the last few months can be seen in the following chart  The following graph shows the Treasury yield curve  which is calculated by dividing the 10 year Treasury yield into the 3 month T bill  On a very basic level tells you gross profit margins of financial institutions  They borrow short term money and loan it out at long term yields  A rising yield curve   especially when above the 1  level   is generally regarded as bullish for the financial market and economic outlook  Since the first and second quantitative easing  QE1 and QE2  programs of recent years the yield curve has been well above 1   But in recent months the yield curve has been falling  as you can see here  The indicator is still reflective of an overall healthy monetary trend  but the falling nature of the Treasury curve may suggest to the Fed that it was high time for the Fed to give the market some sort of boost in the short term even if that  boost  was nothing more than the promise of further stimulus down the road  The Fed s latest failure to do so is another reason why investors are understandably concerned about the tenacity of the recovery and are questioning how much longer it can last without central bank intervention The leaders of both the Fed and the ECB threw out statements to the effect that they may intervene before the end of this year  such an intervention isn t likely  Fed chief Bernanke  like his predecessor  relies on the stock market as a barometer to tell him when intervention is seasonable  Barring an unforeseen market collapse by the end of this year  another round of QE is unlikely in 2012  Aside from the overall strength projected by the major stock market indices  another important indicator is giving Bernanke some assurance that he is okay to hold off on intervening  The New Economy Index  NEI   which reflects the market performance of the leading U S  consumer and business companies  is at a new all time high as of this writing  This chart presents the picture of a bullish consumer retail economic picture  one that Bernanke is surely watching  The last time the Fed intervened with QE2  the NEI had preceded this by giving a  sell  signal  No such sell signal has been made in the New Economy Index since 2010 While it s true that the consumer retail economy is still in good shape  it is a mistake to use surface measures of near term economic strength like corporate profits and retail sales to guide policy decisions  Undercurrents of deflation can still be seen bubbling to the surface from time to time  moreover  the danger of an economic conflagration in Europe   and the possibility of it spreading to the U S    are reasons the Fed should relax its monetary policy stance  Unfortunately  there is every reason for believing the Fed will once again fall asleep at the wheel just as it did in the 2 3 years leading up to the 2008 credit crisis  The Fed isn t solely to be blamed here  It is a truism of history that both governments and central banks have an inveterate tendency to underestimate the amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus needed to resuscitate a flagging economy  Worse  governments often make the wrong policy choices during the most critical times of an economic crisis  Paul Johnson  in his 1991 book Modern Times  made some insightful observations about the economic policies of the Great Depression  He noted for instance   the 1932 Revenue Act saw the greatest taxation increase in U S  history in peacetime  with the rate on high incomes jumping from a quarter to 63 percent  This made nonsense of  President  Hoover s earlier tax cuts but by now Hoover had lost control of Congress and was not in a position to pursue a coherent fiscal policy   Sadly  history has a perverse way of repeating itself and if that observation holds true we can expect to see additional tax increases  in various forms  in the coming years as governments try to deal with the problem of deflation  Although QE1 and QE2 had a discernible impact in lifting equity and commodity prices in the years since the 2008 credit crisis  the Fed s decision to hold off on any further liquidity increases will sooner or later feed into the deflationary undercurrents within the global economy  The reluctance of banks and governments to provide additional stimulus   whether in the form of monetary easing  lower taxes and regulatory easing   will contribute to the downward velocity of the declining long wave cycle in the next couple of years  Gold  as the ultimate safe haven at both ends of the long wave  will eventually prove its merit as a store of value in deflation  Before we arrive at that critical juncture  however  there will undoubtedly be phases of volatility along the way that temporarily obstruct gold s forward progress   just as we ve seen since last September  Although it may seem premature to assert that the Fed has hit the proverbial  kill switch  on liquidity  in the context of the long wave deflation we re in this isn t an exaggeration  By not maintaining an ample supply of liquidity  the Fed has effectively numbered the days of the recovery  Whatever gains the market makes from here will come primarily from a combination of investor psychology  the peaking 4 year cycle plus the residual momentum from the 2009 2012 bull market between now and early 2013  when the final  hard down  phase of the 60 year cycle begins   2014  America s Date With DestinyTake a journey into the future with me as we discover what the future may unfold in the fateful period leading up to   and following   the 120 year cycle

24650,246165,COHR,Rand Paul s Tea Party Manifesto,opinion,With politicians in America and Europe so often being criticised and discredited we take a refreshing look at a daring member of the US Senate and his brave and new ideas for the future  Rand Paul s latest book is different from most other political offerings and is an easy to understand dissection of what got us into this mess  what the solution is  and how we get there  We highly recommend the review below  and adding this book to your summer reading   Politics is a lagging indicator of social cultural trends  Politics doesn t lead change  it chases it  incompetently and long after the underlying reality is impossible to deny  This is why it makes no sense to put faith in politics  By the time politics catches up  the rest of the world has moved on   That said  I ve just finished what might be the finest book ever written by a sitting member of the US Senate  It is daring  It is intellectually serious  It displays mastery of the subject matter  It makes courageous and counterintuitive claims  such as the need for across the board cuts in all spending  including military spending and middle class welfare  by raising the retirement age  It takes on taboo subjects like the war on terror to call for normalcy and peace   It is not a perfect book  and all political books have to be graded on a curve  But in all  it represents a fundamental and thoroughly coherent alternative to politics as we know it and have known it for half a century  Despite my best effort to view this as another political tract  I found the book invigorating and even thrilling in ways I had not expected   The book is The Tea Party Goes to Washington by Sen  Rand Paul  It is his first book since he won the Kentucky race for US Senate  running as a Republican and delivering a crushing blow to his opponent despite amazing smears by the media and very little in the way of support from the GOP itself   Is this book a harbinger of things to come  a sign that the prevailing political paradigm is collapsing or that the political world is beginning to adapt to the dramatic ideological changes present in popular and intellectual culture  There is no way to know  But I do know that it is highly unusual that a book this bold and heterodox would come from a US senator   During Rand Paul s run for the Senate  the media kept describing him as the Tea Party candidate  I ve never understood this designation   The Tea Party  seemed like a moniker attached to anyone mad at the system  but it didn t describe a consistent philosophy  Tea Party rallies could feature speakers both decrying big government and also railing against Medicare and military cuts   Anger is not the same as an agenda  So what s up with these people   This accounts for part of my skepticism on picking up this book  The book begins by explaining the term from his point of view  If he is right  count me in  But even if he is not right  I can now see why he embraced the Tea Party designation  It allowed him to distance himself from politics as usual  whether Republican or Democrat  It allows some degree of independent branding without the caricature that comes with words like libertarian   He actually spends a substantial part of the book explaining that he actually is a libertarian  that he is the right kind of conservative  that he is a constitutionalist  that he counts the so called religious right among his allies  but finds no role for the government in pushing religion  that while he embraces the radical traditions of thought of the libertarian idea  he still regards himself as a backer of limited government  If you want to start putting acid tests on his thinking in the book  you will note that he is mixed on the subject of immigration  he is silent on the drug war  but silent is better than endorsement   and he seems to hold out the possibility of some war making role for the state   If you are looking for a philosopher king  I would suggest other writers  most of them already dead  If you are looking for teachers  there are others who have a more consistent outlook  But as statesmen go  Rand Paul is the obvious and natural successor to his father s vision and political career   He spends a good part of the book s first third detailing the human side of campaigning and the sheer wickedness of the smearing press and what Joe Sobran used to call the opinion cartel of the American system of political coverage  Most famously  Rachel Maddow interviewed Rand as if he were a member of the Klan  Rand didn t catch on that he was being sandbagged until it was too late   All the details of this encounter are in here  all told in a very human way that provides an inside look into the consequences of daring to depart with convention in American politics   Once you move past the inside baseball beginning and the history of the campaign  you get into the substance of this book  and it is here that you find something that is actually extraordinary  This is a political biography that is also a serious and high level manifesto against big government in all its forms  He begins by taking on domestic spending  blasting favored programs of the left and right  hitting federal regulation of American life in sector after sector  slamming the war on civil liberties in all of its manifestations   So far  the book appears to be an outstanding presentation of the free market side of the Republican Party  I m not sure other Republicans have been this gutsy in attacking the Patriot Act  No Child Left Behind  bailouts of all sorts  and the like  In particular  he has great understanding of the boom and bust cycle and the role of the Fed in creating it  He cites all the right ideas in his interpretation of the 2008 crisis   But what I found most impressive is his opposition to big government in the area of military and defense  This has been a sticking point among conservative Republicans since at least the mid 1950s  when it first became convention for the political right to back cuts at home and expansions abroad  Ever since the end of the Cold War  there was a chance for a corrective here  but it has been stubborn in coming   To this day  it remains conventional for those who want domestic cuts to favor expansions of spending on the military   and it appears that the top of the ticket in this election will go this way yet again   Rand Paul will have nothing to do with this  He makes the link between welfare and warfare   Like every aspect of federal expansion  the rise of our national security state represents government growth without end  The great irony is that conservatives preach individual responsibility and reliance domestically but practice policies abroad that create dependence on foreign aid and dependence on foreign soldiers  Though an integral part of the conservative creed is to question government  it makes many Republicans nervous to even hint at questioning our foreign policy   There was a not so coincidental correlation between an ambitious foreign policy and astronomical spending that too many conservatives were willing to ignore because they had adopted the same utopian vision as the philosophically liberal neoconservatives  He goes on to discuss the foreign policy views of Washington and Jefferson  endorses the ideological vision of Robert Taft from the 1950s  and says that Pentagon spending ought to be treated the same as any other spending program  He even goes further to say that it is impossible to have reduced government at home without taking on the warfare state   As for wars themselves  he says that he completely opposes the Iraq war  In principle  he backs the Afghanistan war  but then spends pages and pages exposing the graft and ghastliness of the whole enterprise  calling for an immediate end   Even aside from whatever positions Rand holds on this or that issue  this volume actually contains important research from other sources I had not seen  He offers a startling quotation from Gen  Hugh Shelton  former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  He reports that a White House official asked him  long before Sept  11  if he could float a U 2 plane over Saddam Hussein s military installations so that it could be shot down and precipitate a war  Shelton declined on grounds that he would not murder an American soldier   All credit to Rand for reporting the incident at all   More recently  he has taken up the cause of Internet freedom  opposing intrusive legislation that endangers digital rights  And while he has not come all the way over to opposing  intellectual property  as such  he has been a great opponent of laws that permit website takedowns and SWAT team tactics against alleged infringers   If these views end up making advances and triumphing over the leadership in the party  the apple cart of American politics will be completely turned over  No  I don t hold out much hope that this will happen  and I don t regard Rand Paul as the savior of liberty in our time  Nor does he believe that he is  Even so  this book is an excellent manual about the truth of government in our time   It doesn t give the whole truth  and his naivet  that government can be cut and contained  rather than completely dismembered  is frustrating for anyone steeped in the current radicalism of the liberty minded world  Still  that a book this brassy and bold could come from a sitting member of the US Senate would have been unthinkable a few years ago ,2012-08-23,Will

24651,246166,COHR,Permanent Portfolio Shakedown  Part II ,opinion,In Part I of the Permanent Portfolio Shakedown we investigated the history of the approach  tracing it back to Harry Browne in 1982  The company he helped to found  The Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds  has been running their version of the strategy in a mutual fund for almost 30 years  with fairly impressive results  Harry s thoughts about the portfolio are worth repeating in this second instalment  Established in 1982  in an era of stagnant economic growth and rampant inflation  Permanent Portfolio seeks to provide a sound structure and disciplined approach to asset allocation  The Fund was born in an environment where investors didn t know where to turn  Regardless of what an investor did  they were losing money  Harry Browne  one of the founders of the fund stated   It s easy to think you know what the future holds  but the future invariably contradicts our expectations  Over and over again we are proven wrong when we bet too much on our expectations  Uncertainty is a fact of life   No one can accurately predict the future   The  Permanent Portfolio recognizes this limitation and seeks to invest a fixed  Target Percentage  of its assets to six carefully chosen  diverse and  non correlated  investment categories  Such diversification in a single mutual fund seeks to mitigate risk regardless of the economic climate   Emphasis ours  Harry s critical revelation was that no amount of knowledge about markets or economies will enable an investor to accurately see into the future  so investors should balance portfolios between diversified asset classes to  mitigate risk regardless of the economic climate   This is consistent with the broad intention of Ray Dalio s  All Weather  portfolio and the  Risk Parity  paradigm he spawned  with important differences that we will address later in this article   Later in his career  Harry suggested that a permanent portfolio could be constructed very simply with equal allocations to stocks  Treasuries  T bills and gold  We explored this simple mix in Part 1 to discover how well this portfolio has done since 1970 relative to other common allocation strategies  such as 60 40  and discovered that the  Simple Permanent Portfolio  approach has delivered relatively impressive results over the past 40 years Simple vs  Complex Permanent Portfolio The Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds has been running their Permanent Portfolio mutual fund since 1983  so we wanted to explore the performance of the actual fund versus the simple version since the fund s inception  The Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds only provides annual returns to the mutual fund since inception  so the chart reflects annual returns to both approaches  Chart 1  Permanent Portfolio mutual fund  PRPFX  vs  Simple Permanent PortfolioSource  Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds  Ken French  Shiller  FREDYou will note visually that the simple portfolio tracks the mutual fund quite well  and indeed the correlation between them is 0 70 over the period  which suggests that the simple portfolio explains about 50  of the returns to the mutual fund over the period  PRPFX had a miserable year in 1984  losing about 13  that year while the simple portfolio held in with a return that year of about 4   but PRPFX made up for it from 2002   2007 with substantially higher returns than the simple portfolio  perhaps because of its exposure to real estate The annualized returns to the fund are 6 8  vs  7 8  for the simple version  but this difference would be accounted for by the fund s 0 76  MER and the fees one would incur to purchase the indices in the simple portfolio in ETF form  After accounting for this  the returns are effectively the same  The volatility of the simple portfolio is lower however  at least using annual return data  PRPFX has a realized annual volatility of 8 3 vs  5 3 for the simple version  which means the return risk ratio is lower for the mutual fund  0 82 vs  1 45 The rest of this article will utilize daily long term data for each of the four asset classes in the simple version of the approach going back to 1970  The simple permanent portfolio delivered the following return and risk profile going back to 1970  a review from Part 1   You will note annualized returns of 8 55   a return volatility ratio of 1 25  and a maximum drawdown of about 18   with 93  of rolling 12 month periods delivering positive nominal returns  right bottom corner of data table   We will benchmark all subsequent tests against this basic profile Chart 2  Simple Permanent Portfolio  rebalanced quarterly  1970   2012 Source  Ken French  Shiller  FREDVolatility Management The Permanent Portfolio approach has a faithful following  and for good reason  but we are going to risk introducing a few simple overlays to the basic approach in an effort to improve risk adjusted returns  The most obvious first step  at least for us  is to introduce a volatility management overlay to maintain a consistent risk profile in all market environments  In our experience  we have yet to examine a portfolio management approach where the return risk profile is not improved by intelligent volatility management  The long term ex post observed volatility of the basic simple permanent portfolio is 7   so we will use this target to actively manage the portfolio volatility using the exact same 25  capital allocation to each of the four asset classes  As a reminder  we target portfolio volatility by measuring the volatility of the portfolio at each rebalance period and adjusting total portfolio exposure lower if observed volatility is too high by adding cash  Chart 3  Simple Permanent Portfolio  7  target volatility  rebalanced quarterly  1970   2012 Source  Ken French  Shiller  FRED The volatility targeting approach seems to add some value  raising returns from 8 55  to 8 8  annualized  and reducing the maximum drawdown to 12 4  from 18   or about one third  This seems like a simple  coherent  and intuitive improvement that is worthwhile implementing Risk Parity Risk Parity proponents will protest that the current incarnation of the simple approach has a massively skewed risk profile  Chart 4  shows the return and risk contributions for each of the 4 asset classes in the basic equal weight approach   you may have to click on the image for a readable version  IRX is the T bill  cash  index  Chart 4  Marginal Return and Risk contributions 1970   2012 Source  Ken French  Shiller  FRED You can see that stocks and gold  VTILT and GLDLT respectively  contribute about 5x   8x as much marginal volatility to the portfolio as Treasuries  IEFLT   though they only contribute about 25  more returns  The marginal risk contribution accounts for the risk each asset contributes to the portfolio after accounting for the asset s diversification potential  While Treasuries are structurally less volatile than stocks or gold over the long term  they also provide stronger diversification than either stocks or bonds within the portfolio  As a result  Treasuries  hit above their weight class  in the portfolio in terms of the diversification they provide relative to the risk they introduce  This explains why the marginal risk contribution of stocks and gold is greater than either s proportional volatility  while the risk contribution of bonds is lower than bond s proportional volatility  Adherents to the risk parity philosophy aim to create portfolios where each asset class contributes an equal amount of volatility to the portfolio rather than an equal amount of capital  Chart 5  approximates a risk parity approach using stocks  gold and Treasuries  with a 7  risk target  The cash allocation is dynamic where cash expands and contracts in the portfolio in order to keep the portfolio volatility close to our 7  target   Chart 5  Simple Permanent Portfolio  Risk Parity  7  target volatility 1970   2012 Source  Ken French  Shiller  FREDThe 7  target volatility risk parity version above delivers similar returns to the traditional simple approach  with 13  lower volatility and 35  lower drawdown  However  the ex post allocation to cash at a 7  volatility target is just 8   In order to have a 25  average allocation to cash over the period  in keeping with the traditional simple approach  we need to apply a 5  risk target instead Chart 6  Simple Permanent Portfolio  Risk Parity  5  target volatility  1970   2012Source  Ken French  Shiller  FRED The realized ex post volatility of the 5  target volatility risk parity permanent portfolio is just 4 84   and the largest drawdown was just 8 4   for which investors would have been compensated with a 7 89  annualized return  Pretty amazing for a portfolio with half the volatility and just 25  of the drawdown of a typical bond portfolio A Tactical Permanent Portfolio We ll really be treading on thin ice with the die hard permanent portfolio crowd with these next simulations  but I hope they will forgive our impiety in our perpetual pursuit of a  better way    The potential problem  as we see it  with any static asset allocation  including the permanent portfolio s permanent equal weight allocations to stocks  bonds  gold and cash  is that sometimes everything is expensive all at once  and returns to all asset classes have the potential to be low or negative in tandem  The current environment may represent one of these periods  where certainly bonds and cash are more expensive than they have ever been  with yields on Treasuries lower than at any other time in the last 220 years  source  Bank of America   Cash yields essentially zero  We think stocks are expensive as well  see  and    and gold is at best a wildcard  having rallied by 500  or more from its lows in 2001   If we are right  and the permanent portfolio is vulnerable to synchronized losses  then it makes sense to explore some tactical or dynamic overlays to help avoid investing in asset classes in sustained downtrends   Mebane Faber is credited with bringing moving averages to the masses with his Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation  in 2005  In it  he describes an approach that applies a 10 month moving average to basket of 5 asset classes  stocks  Treasuries  commodities  REITs and international stocks  While there is nothing magical about the 10 month moving average  this approach is ubiquitously cited elsewhere  and in our testing we observed no material difference with other moving averages  The following simulations apply monthly rebalancing  Chart 7  Simple Permanent Portfolio  10 Month MA  1970   2012 Source  Faber  Ken French  Shiller  FREDChart 7  delivers a pretty compelling equity line  You will note that returns rise above 10  annualized over the period while volatility and drawdowns remain similar to the original simple approach  The majority of losses to this approach occurred during the tumultuous 1970s and 1980  with the largest drawdown occurring in March of 1980 as gold and stocks collapsed at the same time while both were far above their respective 10 month moving averages  We stated above that risk adjusted returns are almost always improved by managing portfolio level volatility  so below we tested the Faber 10 month moving average approach but also applied a 7  target volatility overlay  Chart 8 shows the results of this combination Chart 8  Simple Permanent Portfolio  10 Month MA  1970   2012Source  Faber  Ken French  Shiller  FRED Now we are really cooking  While the absolute performance of the approach drops by about 0 4 percentage points per year  the risk profile drops dramatically  volatility drops to 5 5  annualized and the maximum drawdown drops to 9  from 19   Even better  investors would have realized positive results over 98  of rolling 12 month periods Conclusions Permanent Portfolio adherents are right to be proud of the performance of their approach over the past 40 years  Of all the static asset allocation approaches we have tested  the PP ranks near the top of the list in terms of risk adjusted returns  Further  the philosophy behind its construction is consistent with the goal of resilience in the face of any economic environment   Even PP zealots would be silly not to consider some of the simple volatility based overlays that we presented however  Simple volatility management techniques are philosophically and empirically coherent  and deliver similar results with much smaller drawdowns  While risk management is important  it does not address the most important challenge to the traditional portfolio  what happens next  That is  how will the traditional model behave going forward in the current environment  where all assets have been artificially inflated at once via coordinated global central bank intervention  Will the portfolio prove resilient to a period of sustained global deflation with Treasury yields already at record lows  Tactical overlays to the traditional approach may help address this problem by systematically exiting asset classes that are exhibiting strong and or sustained negative price trends  The simple Faber moving average approach on its own does not seem to deliver much value above the profile of the traditional PP approach  However  combining a tactical moving average approach with simple volatility management delivers similar high returns  but without the major drawdown characteristics of the simple MA approach  Further  this approach delivered positive returns over 98  of periods

24652,246167,COHR,Here s Why You Shouldn t Go Away In May,opinion, Sell in May and Go Away  is an easily remembered rule that worked very well for the past two years  Last year from April 30 to August 31  the S P 500 lost 11   For more than fifty years it s been sound advice 47  of the time so slightly less effective than a coin flip  However  when it works  the results can be memorable  and some spectacular falls in stocks have occurred during this time period including 1966   15    1974   20    2002   15   and 2010   12    Recent years have reinforced the rule  with eight out of twelve summers this millennium representing an unwelcome vacation distraction  Many a holiday has been ruined by portfolio losses on top of that expensive beach house  and no doubt those painful memories persist  However  during the 80s and 90s it worked in only seven years out of 20  Perhaps unsurprisingly  the overall market direction plays a big role  Two thirds of the time Sell in May worked was when the market s return for the year was negative  So if you re skilled at selecting good years to be in stocks  you can make your summers a bit more enjoyable  And for those who want a little bit of an edge  Sell in May followed the pattern set in the first four months of the year 61  of the time  A bad start for the year is a little more likely to continue a few months longer In total though  following the Sell in May adage since 1960 would have  cost  an investor on average 0 5  p a    more after commissions and taxes are included  Interestingly  most of the 6 3  compounded annual return over this entire period was generated while school was open  As it turns out  the summer that s about to end ranks  26 with a 1  return  close to the average  This is a seasonal pattern that s worth following  but barely  However  while Sell in May is not a profitable strategy  for some investors the foregone return by being out of the market may seem a price worth paying for a quiet vacation Although macro issues continue to hang over the market and rising prices were caused in part by the calamities that did not befall  i e  southern Europe still uses Euros   it is notable how many companies reporting earnings during the summer as well as revised down earnings guidance and generally expressed caution  Even the most economically insensitive companies tempered outlooks  Examples include McDonalds  MCD  which  citing macro headwinds  reported no increase in monthly global comps in July   the worst since April 2003  Coke  KO  experienced declining volumes of 4  in Europe during the second quarter  IBM  IBM  saw revenues contract globally and profit growth for many companies is relying on improved operating margins rather than top line growth  While it s never easy to assess whether macro concerns are fully reflected in market prices  or indeed overly reflected  the more cautious outlook recently being provided at the individual company level is noteworthy The  fiscal cliff  is also a perplexing hurdle that isn t yet receiving the respect it deserves  One major investment bank has in its quarterly GDP forecast a fairly smooth sequence of figures from 3Q12 to 1Q13   1 5    2 0    1 5   that seem to defy common sense  While Washington is consumed with an election countless organizations big and small are planning 2013 capital expenditures and hiring without knowing whether we ll have a Made in DC recession on January 1st  Anecdotally  many companies are already delaying major commitments until they have greater visibility into 2013 economic activity Conventional wisdom is that the lame duck Congress will amiably defer the mandated tax hikes and spending cuts to later in 2013 and the new Congress  whereas many of us recall that this is the same group of legislators who brought America to the verge of  technical  default during the debt ceiling brinkmanship last Summer  when Sell in May worked   Sometime shortly after the election when the celebrations and recriminations are still fresh  one deeply unhappy party will be expected to compromise with another victorious one  While things will probably work out  because they usually do  a crisis free experience seems unlikely  The Congressional calendar provides just sixteen days when the House will be in session between Election Day and December 14th when they recess  There seems plenty of room for a miscalculation Meanwhile stable  dividend paying stocks are by many measures relatively expensive  most recently highlighted in Barron s on August 24th   It s not surprising that low interest rates and widespread global uncertainty have made  say  Kraft  KFT  appealing  because demand for Oreo cookies and cheese is more predictable than Chinese demand for iron ore or the ability of large banks to both reinvent their business models and avoid endless debilitating investigations and fines  To borrow from Michael Lewis in Liar s Poker  an investor in Goldman Sachs must ask where will the firm find their next  Herman the German   AKA gullible buyer of hard to understand securities  One interesting lesson in the field of Behavioral Finance is that many investors apply unreasonably narrow ranges to their forecasts of outcomes  In other words  most of us have a tendency to be over confident that we are right about our investment decisions  Which is why  in spite of the preceding cautious market narrative we are not heavily invested in cash at present  As coherent as this letter might  hopefully  appear  it could also be dead wrong  and the longer the investment horizon the more likely the outcome is to be good  However  while we haven t sold everything  we have over the past couple of months shifted in our Deep Value Equity strategy away from cyclical exposure and towards companies whose risk is substantially idiosyncratic  Will Corrections Corp  CXW  convert to a REIT  which should cause a meaningful increase in valuation  Will JCPenney  JCP  carry out a successful transformation  Will AIG continue to buy back the government s shares in it at half of book value  Will Warren Buffett repurchase shares in Berkshire  BRK B  if they fall to within 10  of book value  Will Burger King  BKW  and Family Dollar  FDO  improve their operating metrics towards those of their peers  All of these are holdings in our Deep Value Equity strategy  along with cash and gold miners  GDX  to protect against deflation and reflation respectively Our Hedged Dividend Capture Strategy is very low turnover by design and so retains its positions in stable  low beta  dividend paying stocks such as MCD  KO  KFT and others mentioned above  We believe the combination of these long positions with a short S P 500 hedge results in a portfolio uncorrelated with equities  Performance for the year in this strategy is flat  since the  13  return in the S P 500 has generally favored higher beta names with low or no dividend  Interestingly  without Apple  AAPL  the S P 500 would be up 2 2  less than it is so far this year  16  of its return  Just being short AAPL has reduced performance in this strategy by a little over 1   It s an amazing outcome considering AAPL began the year with a 3  weighting in the S P 500  it s now over 4    We re not even negative on AAPL  we re simply short it through its inclusion in the S P 500 Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  continue to look attractive with 6   yields and solid growth prospects  Developing new energy infrastructure to support the growing domestic production of oil and natural gas will remain a vital element of energy independence for many years to come  The likelihood of low bond yields for the foreseeable future combined with the inflation protection such assets afford through their ability to raise prices annually make this a useful income generating investment for many investors  In August we reduced our position in Sunoco Logistics Partners  SXL  in those accounts where this long held position had become overweight through strong performance and reallocated towards Oneok Partners  OKS  All of which goes to show that  had we embraced Sell in May for many sound reasons at the beginning of the summer we would have been dead wrong then too ,2012-09-06,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here's-why-you-shouldn't-go-away-in-may-135355,135355
24675,246190,COHR,Thoughts On The Upcoming Fiscal Fiasco ,opinion,I met with our accounts in London this past week  The number one concern among investors here is the US fiscal cliff at the beginning of next year  That seems to be a bigger worry than a breakup of the euro zone  There is a great deal of interest in the upcoming US presidential elections  and a sense that the fiscal cliff is more likely to be averted if Mitt Romney wins  If Barack Obama wins  the fear is that political gridlock will thwart any attempts at a bipartisan compromise on fiscal policy I tend to agree with this assessment  However  in either case  I expect that right after the November 6 elections  Congress will pass legislation that will delay the fiscal cliff until mid 2013  That doesn t guarantee that this problem will be resolved by then even if Romney wins  There is already a big debate about Romney s fiscal plan In the 8 28 WSJ  Martin Feldstein wrote an op ed titled  Romney s Tax Plan Can Raise Revenue   It s no surprise that Feldstein is defending the Romney plan since it reflects some of his suggestions  especially capping the amount that an individual taxpayer can benefit from tax loopholes  It s a great idea  The Simpson Bowles deficit reduction plan also targets eliminating lots of the loopholes  The problem is that all those high priced and high powered lobbyists in Washington will fight tooth and nail to keep the loopholes they worked so hard to stick into the tax code for their special interest clients  Leaving the loopholes alone but limiting their use by individual taxpayers would certainly help to call off the attack dogs However  Republican legislators who signed Grover Norquist s no new taxes pledge might baulk at capping loopholes even if one of their own is in the Oval Office  Norquist  who is president of Americans for Tax Reform  recently claimed that his pledge is more popular than ever  The 6 21 WSJ reported   As evidence  he says  the pledge is growing in popularity among congressional candidates  In all  449 incumbents and challengers signed the pledge in 2010  including 241 challengers and 208 incumbents  This time around  534 have signed the pledge  including 255 challengers and 279 incumbents  he said  In his op ed  Feldstein wrote   Mitt Romney s plan to cut taxes and offset the resulting revenue loss by limiting tax breaks has been attacked as  mathematically impossible   He would reduce all individual income tax rates by 20   eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax and the estate tax  and limit tax deductions and loopholes that allow high income taxpayers to reduce their tax payments  All this  say critics  would require a large tax increase on the middle class to avoid raising the deficit  Careful analysis shows this is not the case  The question is whether the no new taxes crowd would accept a cap on loopholes in exchange for lower marginal tax rates  I think it is a very fair trade  I am especially fond of the Simpson Bowles plan  which would eliminate all if not most tax loopholes and use the money to slash marginal tax rates and still put us on a path towards significant deficit reduction  Feldstein s approach may increase the chances of implementing a lite version of Simpson Bowles  That would be better than no plan  which remains a possibility if political gridlock prevails no matter who wins in November In his 8 23 NYT column  David Brooks blamed Republican VP nominee Paul Ryan for scuttling the Simpson Bowles plan  Ryan was a member of this commission and voted against the plan   Ryan voted no for intellectually coherent reasons  He argued that the single biggest contributing factor to public debt is the unsustainable growth of Medicare  Yet the Simpson Bowles plan did nothing to restructure Medicare  and it sidestepped health care issues generally  Ryan said that it was silly to come up with a debt reduction proposal that didn t fix the single biggest driver of the nation s debt  Brooks claims that   i f Ryan and the other House Republicans had voted for the Simpson Bowles proposal  it would have gone to Congress for up or down votes  regardless of how President Obama reacted  We would have had national action on debt reduction   That s a stretch  to say the least  The Democrats weren t blameless  and the President showed no interest in pushing for the plan whatsoever  Here are the facts  1  The original bipartisan legislation proposing the commission would have required Congress to vote on its recommendations as presented  without any amendment  2  In January 2010  that bill failed in the Senate by a vote of 53 46  when six Republicans who had co sponsored it nevertheless voted against it  Thereafter  Obama established the Commission by Executive Order 13531  3  The Simpson Bowles report was released on December 1  2010  but failed a vote on December 3  Eleven of 18 votes were in favor  with a supermajority of 14 votes needed to formally endorse the blueprint  Among the seven dissenters were four Democrats  A curse on both their Houses On the other hand  in his acceptance speech in Tampa  Ryan failed to mention that he was a member of the commission and voted against its proposal  Instead  he noted that President Obama  created a bipartisan debt commission   He said   They came back with an urgent report  He thanked them  sent them on their way  and then did exactly nothing  Republicans stepped up with good faith reforms and solutions equal to the problems  How did the president respond  By doing nothing  nothing except to dodge and demagogue the issue  A curse on both their Houses Finally  for now  here s one more item on this subject from last week s news  On Tuesday  Gene Sperling  the influential head of President Obama s National Economic Council  said that if the President is re elected he will seek a sweeping deficit reduction agreement with Congress based on the  basic framework  of the Simpson Bowles commission report  Sperling said he expects aggressive budget talks to begin after the November 6 election to avoid taking the nation over the fiscal cliff  Sperling said Obama would like to negotiate a deficit reduction accord similar to the deal he was discussing with House Speaker John Boehner last year  However  he made it clear that Obama would insist on a deficit reduction deal that includes additional revenues and did not have spending cuts that are as deep as those proposed by congressional Republicans led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ,2012-09-09,Ed

24686,246201,COHR,Dissecting the Federal Reserve s Housing White Paper,opinion,Last week the Federal Reserve released its white paper outlining current conditions in the housing market as well as a framework for addressing a number of issues preventing market stabilization housing white paper 20120104  After a media blitz by several senior Fed officials  the proposal garnered considerable attention both by the media as well as among policymakers and the industry   The Fed white paper provides a number of tantalizing ideas regarding ways to reinvigorate the moribund housing market and while this renewed interest in housing is welcome  any significant short term relief to markets is unlikely to occur   In assessing the framework s ability to address underlying problems in the market  I have categorized issues from the white paper as follows Reducing market uncertaintyThe Fed references several examples of how uncertainty in government policy and the economic environment has up to this point dampened more robust participation by lenders  borrowers and investors in activities that would otherwise  stabilize home prices and the mortgage market   Although a host of other structural problems have impeded meaningful housing recovery  uncertainty over policy and market outcomes created over a period of years since the crisis due to a host of reactive and disconnected policy actions is perhaps the greatest impediment to market stabilization   Such is the case with repurchase uncertainty hanging over lenders these days as well as concerns over employment and the direction of home prices in the near term for prospective borrowers   The tip of the housing policy spear in the Fed s view are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  the twin housing GSEs which remain in a state of suspended animation while the government figures out what it plans to do with them in the long run   Maintaining these two agencies in their current state is no longer in the best interest of achieving the goal of stabilizing housing in the next few years GSE ConsolidationIt isn t much of a stretch to wonder why so there remains so much tentativeness in housing by market participants when you consider that we lack of a comprehensive housing recovery plan   So far housing policy in this area has been piecemeal and somewhat ad hoc in nature  with various loan modification programs and their limited effects epitomizing efforts to date   Part of the problem lies in the fragmented accountability for housing that crosses multiple federal agencies  and state and local legal jurisdictions   The Fed points out how raising Gfees for the GSEs may be hampering mortgage refinancing and yet we now have the new payroll extension bill adding another 10bps to GSE Gfees   Here is yet another example of consensus based policymaking that imposes adverse impacts on markets already under significant duress    Additional uncertainty arises for prospective homebuyers worried about buying a home and then losing their job or part of their income and or seeing their home s value drop in price   I will revisit this issue in the next section   The GSEs themselves introduce a fair amount of uncertainty and unnecessary confusion at the moment to lender partners in terms of differences in policies and terms of business   Although operating under FHFA conservatorship some general policy alignment between the GSEs has been taking place  now is the time to consider a radical strategy of combining the two with the intent of creating a GSE good bank bad bank structure   The retained portfolios of each firm should be combined into a  bad bank  operation charged with aggressively managing down the portfolio consistent with activities that maximize value for the taxpayer   Likewise the guarantee businesses of both Fannie and Freddie should be consolidated into one organization   good bank  with the mission to enhance market liquidity and access to credit   With the CEOs of both companies turning over and significant reductions in force taking place over the last year or more at both GSEs  now may be an opportune time to realign the organizations   Separating the retained portfolios from the guarantee business into two distinct entities focused on front  and back end activities improves the ability of the agencies to be more agile and responsive to these very different aspects of the housing market   It also would introduce greater clarity and efficiency into the marketplace for lenders and investors to have to deal with one instead of two organizations  Stimulating Mortgage DemandThe Fed white paper outlines the need to address tight credit lending standards by banks as well as financing mechanisms for bulk REO investment   In the case of mortgage lending standards the Fed is largely without answers   Nevertheless  I find it ironic that the Fed expresses such concern over tight credit standards now when during the housing boom the interagency task force on nontraditional mortgages issued its guidance well after that horse was out of the barn    In fact  raising issues that  less than half  of 620 FICO borrowers putting 10  down on a home receive a mortgage offer seems a bit incongruous with the initial Qualified Residential Mortgage  QRM  proposal under the Dodd Frank Act s risk retention provisions defining QRM eligibility for purchase money mortgages that have at least 20  down   The Fed paper places part of the blame for tight credit conditions on GSE repurchase activity and Basel III MSR provisions   No question that limiting the percent of MSRs to Tier 1 capital to 10  incents holders of these assets to rethink their strategic contribution to the firm   Moreover  aggressive GSE repurchase activity following the crisis perfectly illustrates the conflicts in policy viewpoints and agendas among federal agencies   FHFA is appropriately focused on activities that minimize taxpayer exposure to the GSEs and robust repurchase processes serve that purpose but clearly create unintended consequences as a result   The potential to use repurchase insurance products that exist today could be one way for lenders to expand lending consistent with GSE terms   In the end  however  the economics of the transaction have to make sense for the lender and given alternative investments and balance sheet constraints  it may be some time before lenders find mortgages a strategic asset in growing their business   Finally  the lack of borrower demand isn t just due to tight lending practices but also the psychological damage prospective borrowers have suffered through prolonged economic weakness   I ve written about this before  specifically outlining new products that could entice borrowers back in the market if sufficient protections to their mortgage payment and home values are provided  HousingCrisisSupply side RemediesThe Fed s discussion of how to address stubbornly high REO levels through REO rental programs may have some potential  but understanding the needs of both holders of REO assets and prospective investors is instructive   The Fed may be first understating the amount of REO inventory that would be attractive to investors   Recent figures suggest that 14 15  of distressed properties are damaged   The costs of rehabilitating such properties is costly and cannot be understated   The Fed offers some calculations suggesting that REO cap rates estimated at around 8  may be attractive to investors given rent and home price trends   Behind such numbers are assumptions on vacancy rates of single family properties as well as costs with maintaining these properties   And while cap rates for multifamily investments compressed in 2011  ranging between 6 5  and 9    reflecting interest rates and competition in the market for high quality properties  large differences in managing a pool of single family versus multifamily properties remain   For example  a 50 unit multifamily property enjoys geospatial efficiencies in maintenance that a pool of single family properties does not enjoy   Another metric  the debt service coverage ratio for a typical multifamily deal needs to be at least above 1 25 to be attractive to investors and so differences between what bulk REO investors are willing to pay and what REO holders are willing to give up create pricing discrepancies that have thus far precluded market clearing on a significant scale notwithstanding a host of other contributing factors to this problem   Further  with a quarter of REO held by banks  until some mechanism is created to mitigate the hit to banks for REO haircuts that would allow for market clearing  the impasse will continue   Compounding the problem as the Fed rightly calls out is a lack of debt financing structures to accommodate bulk REO purchases   Both issues are addressed in an earlier policy briefing I provided on stabilizing housing by development of a private public financing structure that imposes no additional costs onto the taxpayer  See link above  Homeowner Fairness and Loss Mitigation EffortsWe have struggled since the crisis to find an effective program to help maintain homeownership that balances fairness and economic realities   Various incarnations of loan modification programs have been spectacular failures   for some reason thinking that we could create a set of standard rules that explain the unique circumstances of each and every borrower is another great example of the lack of creativity allowed in shaping such programs   I recall my astonishment not all that long ago as Chief Risk Officer at a major bank at being told by one regulator that the custom loan modification program my risk management group had developed had to be replaced with a  Mod in the Box  one size fits all program   With a standard 31  debt to income ratio rule applied to all borrowers is there any wonder why we ve had so little improvement in modifications   The Fed brings up principal reduction programs as a possible solution to negative equity problems but proceeding along this path without appropriate incentives behind such a program is fraught with danger   Surprisingly  Mr  Dudley at the New York Fed downplayed the impact of moral hazard used in such cases  and I m wondering if he may have seen the statistics on strategic defaults   In any event  principal forgiveness even if earned poses significant incentive issues for borrowers and equity issues as well   What exactly will the 30  or so of all homeowners that own their house outright think about principal reduction   As he states   We either assist everyone or assist nobody  Summary ThoughtsWhile this vivisection of the Fed white paper might have readers thinking that it has little to cheer about  the glass is half full view suggests something very different  Surprisingly it represents the real first attempt to put an issues and policy framework together for housing and thus raises the stakes for other policy participants to participate and react   However  it severely misses the mark to provide a comprehensive strategy for addressing housing policy by not offering any tangible solutions to act on   We are now in the 5th year of the housing downturn and it is disappointing that for all of that time the best we have to show for it is a summary framework recommending more analysis   Between Treasury s white paper on GSE reform and this effort  a great deal of uncertainty remains over the fortunes of the housing market   Political rhetoric and turf issues aside  a coherent strategy for housing needs to be established that goes beyond the incrementalist approach taken so far and introduces creative structural solutions addressing market uncertainty  financing and equity ,2012-01-13,Dr. Clifford Rossi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dissecting-the-federal-reserve’s-housing-white-paper-111167,111167
24699,246214,COHR,Is The Resurrection Of Undervalued Miners in 2012 Beginning  ,opinion,Once again at the end of 2011 we heard the voices of negation sounding the fear of the bursting of the commodities bubble   The naysayers come out with their Cassandra calls whenever commodities go into a characteristic and salubrious selloff   They never really learn to respect the importance of gold  GLD  and silver s  SLV  role in the long range secular multiyear ongoing rise Gold Stock Trades emphasized the importance of avoiding knee jerk reactions when precious metals experience healthy pullbacks   Today the commodities  DBC  are rising across the board as they return from the premature grave to which the naysayers have assigned them One wonders how the short sellers are enjoying this periodic resurrection in vital metals such as gold GLD   silver SLV   rare earths  REMX  and uraniums URA  Attendant to a new rise in these vital commodities  the economic base should be prepared to receive them   On January 24th 25th the Federal Open Market Committee will be meeting once again in Washington   One of the areas on which they will be focusing is the travails of the U S  Housing Market and new methods to bring down the high unemployment rate   The Fed is promising a transparent horizon of record low interest rates to provoke the banks to lend money It is important that the Eurozone malaise undergo corrective measures in order to restore Europe to health   Recently Christine Lagarde  Head of the International Monetary Fund  has expressed broad generalities toward the need of fiscal reforms   It is hoped that Lagarde will not be a laggard in the birth of the  EuroTarp  by whatever stimuli to be applied It is important that a coherent plan of attack be formulated rather than the indiscriminate printing of Euros FXE   which we are currently witnessing   The Euro is rapidly losing value   This procedure of currency devaluations is counter productive unless corrective measures are instituted such as serious spending restraints  permanent tax rate cuts and regulatory relief   In plain language  the Europeans and the Americans can t print more dollars  UUP  without building on a base of budgetary restraint How does this affect our selected precious metals stocks GDX   rare earths  REMX  and uraniums URA    This week the rare earths are emerging from their  second half 2011 slumber   It is felt that they will lead the upcoming recovery   This week certain of the rare earths are producing impressive percentage gains as an augury of things to come As of this writing we believe Tasman TAS  and Ucore UURAF  are leading the pack   These stocks possess unique features to which attention must be paid   Ucore owns a mountain of high grade heavy rare earths right here in the United States    Tasman dominates the European Continent as the only possessor of a 43 101 resource with heavy rare earths and a high percentage of the vital element dysprosium     Rare Element Resources  REE  released news that they have just expanded their resource to show potential for heavy rare earths   The market is reacting favorably as it has nearly doubled in one week Ucore  Tasman and Rare Element Resources have broken downtrends on record high volume the first week of 2012   Molycorp  MCP  has underperformed and still needs to break above resistance as it is lagging the sector China is playing a dual role not only for their own domestic needs but in establishing a quota system for exports to other nations   This emphasizes the importance for the West and Japan to establish an independent role in their own destiny   No matter what happens in the pending appeal with China at the World Trade Organization  The West has learned a valuable lesson in geopolitics as the external industrial nations recognize the importance of rare earth independence The uranium sector is enjoying a profitable day as well   No other area has had to come up from taking a count so many times   The press has obscured  misrepresented and sensationalized the true story about the role of nuclear energy NLR  in a modern  industrial world   The media has relegated uranium mining to the status of selling newspapers and  TV commercials   The truth be damned   Imagine when the true story is finally told   Not once have the talking heads mentioned that reactors that are being built are portable  economical and safe   The truth can not be suppressed much longer Uranerz  URZ  is within 12 18 months of producing yellowcake at a profit even in the less than ebullient marketplace   Remember that Hathor  HAT TSX  a mine far removed from production has been bought by Rio Tinto  RIO  who outbid rival Cameco  CCJ    This emphasizes the undervaluation of our nuclear miners especially Uranerz  which is the next U S  producer of uranium   It must not be forgotten that over 90  of uranium in the U S  is imported In conclusion  our sectors and recommendations are once again emerging from their long bases   Reiterating the long ascendance of these sectors  patience is paramount albeit painful   We have been advising our readers that this correction in commodities would be far from terminal and represents a classic buying opportunity ,2012-01-07,Jeb

24707,246222,COHR,A Blueprint for GSE and Secondary Mortgage Market Transition,opinion,Yesterday marked an important milestone in the mortgage market with the announcement by FHFA of what may lie ahead for the GSEs   For the first time  government officials outlined a coherent strategy for a successful transition of the two mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which indicates that the state of limbo that secondary markets have been in ever since the two entities entered conservatorship in 2008 may be approaching an important turning point   Don t expect vast changes to occur in the next year certainly with a Presidential election heating up   But the fact that the FHFA put this plan forward marks a critical time for the mortgage market as facilitating a transition to a sustainable mortgage finance system is no easy task The plan cites a set of core objectives that FHFA has used to guide the conservatorship process including mitigating losses to the taxpayer  enhancing access to mortgage finance for homeowners and assisting struggling borrowers per the various Administration and other foreclosure prevention programs    Now FHFA states the time has come to move forward with the next phase of the process which includes building the next generation secondary market infrastructure  reduce the GSE s market presence  and maintain focus on foreclosure prevention activities   While the plan is not specific on the exact manner in which transition of the GSEs to another form takes place  a workable approach should entail a well choreographed set of activities that ultimately leads to a complete wind down of both GSEs with them being replaced by one of the three options laid out by Treasury and widely supported in the market FHFA in its plan lays out some of the progress it has made in aligning important aspects of the GSEs  business including its Servicing Alignment Initiative  the Uniform Mortgage Data Program and aligning the GSEs  rep and warrant policies  among others   So clearly FHFA believes that consistency and alignment of practices and activities between Fannie and Freddie is worthwhile   Other aspects of the current state of conservatorship highlighted by FHFA include the need to recognize economies of scale in technology and the importance of standardization while recognizing challenges in maintaining focus on the core objectives mentioned by FHFA above    With these core principles it is possible to offer a blueprint for an effective transition from conservatorship today into a vibrant replacement for the GSEs that meets all of the objectives laid out in FHFA s plan Although a number of possible transition models exist  to get a glimpse into what could take place consider the following plan that could have a timeframe of 2 3 years   Other than historical legacy  one could argue that maintaining both GSEs in their current form does not meet FHFA s objectives for mortgage markets   There is a great deal of complexity in managing both enterprises in their current form that poses a challenge to FHFA s desired outcome of alignment and consistency of practices and activities of the GSEs despite the progress made by FHFA on this front to this point   Thus  a possible step forward would be to merge one of the GSEs in with the other  consolidating the various businesses in the process and restructuring them into a logical set of activities lined up against FHFA s plan objectives   This approach has the clear advantage of creating improvements in execution of specific strategies such as winding down the retained portfolios  foreclosure prevention and maintaining a stable liquid market for mortgage finance   It doesn t hurt either that both companies are in need of new leadership  thus reducing management frictions that can accompany such consolidations   Further  the FHFA has cited a number of challenges in retaining sufficient talent at both companies to ensure adequate focus on important initiatives that could be improved through consolidation   By leaving one GSE in place to absorb the other it also helps maintain market stability since the  acquiring  GSE would honor the outstanding debt of the other GSE   GSE consolidation would facilitate further streamlining among GSE activities  promote greater transparency for lender partners and vendors  and otherwise establish a structure better suited for FHFA s long term plan Once the consolidation has been completed  the second step in the process would be to reconfigure the entities  businesses to allow for single point accountability for each strategic initiative outlined by FHFA earlier   This could be done by creating effectively four business lines  legacy business  current state single family securitization business  multifamily  and future state infrastructure   The legacy business would be comprised of two parts  one would house the retained portfolios of both GSEs  the second being a group focused on foreclosure prevention efforts of legacy assets   The legacy portfolio group would focus entirely on least cost asset disposition strategies and interest rate risk management activities   The aggregate single family securitization activity of the consolidated GSE would continue as today until the future state infrastructure was available along with the replacement securitization conduit structures   However  a single security would be issued  either a MBS or PC   This would allow for FHFA s goal of realizing a single mortgage backed security sooner than they anticipate in their plan   The securitization entity would house all of the associated processes consolidated from both enterprises including debt issuance  credit and counterparty risk management  credit guarantee pricing  quality control and sourcing  among others   Given duplication at both enterprises across these activities  some efficiencies will be gained in addition to attaining complete alignment of policies  procedures and strategy   A consolidated multifamily guarantee business would be created focusing on replacing government with private guarantees   The fourth group would be tasked with development of the next generation secondary market loan systems and infrastructure    This would include design and deployment of the new servicing platform  pooling and servicing agreements  data and loan documentation requirements  among other activities   Elements from other areas deemed to be duplicative could be reassigned to this group along with other resources dedicated to such efforts today   Two other important support functions  legacy IT and Operations Administration would round out the structure of the consolidated GSE   The existing IT systems of both entities would be used in the legacy group since they would need to manage assets from both GSEs while the securitization activity in theory could be conducted from a single GSE platform Once the new securitization infrastructure has been developed and tested  the new replacement conduits based on one of the three options laid out by Treasury would be established and capitalized   This might over time be facilitated by efforts to reduce GSE market presence by raising Gfees  establishing loss sharing arrangements and revitalizing mortgage insurance contracts as mentioned by FHFA   Greater use of MI  however  it is important to note is not without a set of financial and policy challenges  namely the extreme weakness of the MI industry and Qualified Residential Mortgage  QRM  proposed rules under Dodd Frank Act risk retention provisions that are overly restrictive for non GSE loans   With this new infrastructure and capitalized replacement conduits in place  the consolidated GSE could be placed into receivership and wound down   Having consolidated both GSEs first and restructuring the organizations would make this somewhat easier   Some parts of the company could conceivably be merged in with Ginnie Mae or FHA if deemed to have value for these agencies   This might include the remnants from the legacy foreclosure prevention group  for example This hypothetical framework is not without its challenges from an implementation and policy perspective  and it would be up to FHFA to methodically analyze what sequence of restructuring activities is needed and what it would look like before it could be undertaken   Nevertheless  the example above provides a clear way out of the mortgage financing morass that has enveloped the entire housing market since the crisis   The FHFA s plan signals that change is needed  and the prospect for revitalizing the secondary market now seems for the first time a real possibility ,2012-02-22,Dr. Clifford

24708,246223,COHR,Europe  About to Take One Step Back ,opinion,The story of Europe has been the story of two steps forward and one step back  Here are the two steps forward  Since the eurozone crisis  the ECB has taken steps with its LTRO programs to stabilize the banking and financial system  Moreover  I wrote that Mario Draghi  on behalf of the eurocrats  outlined the Grand Plan as a way to fix the long term problems within the eurozone  The Grand Plan consisted of two steps  which sound like pages taken from the Maggie Thatcher playbook Austerity in the form of  good austerity   defined as lower taxes and less government spending  andStructural reform  which is the European version of the China taking steps to   which translates to union busting and going after all of the entrenched interests of the old with their lifetime jobs and gold plated pensions at the expense of the young jobless The one step back happens when Europe dilutes these grandiose objectives  In the wake of the  and   a step backward is inevitable Time for Grand Plan 2 0 Most recently  the   The organization indicated more work needed to be done  i e  Grand Plan  and market confidence is fragile  At about the same time   Spain is likely  in our view  to be pushed into a troika  EC  ECB  IMF  programme of some kind during 2012  possibly by losing access to market funding on affordable terms  but more likely by the ECB making a programme for the Spanish sovereign a condition for continued willingness to fund the Spanish banks  which are currently the main buyers of newly issued Spanish sovereign debt  The existing and likely near future EFSF ESM and IMF financial facilities are unlikely to be sufficient to both fund the Spanish sovereign fully and leave enough financial ammunition in reserve to deal with possible sovereign financial emergencies in Italy or in the  soft core  of the euro area  The Spanish sovereign would therefore likely continue to fund itself at least partly in the markets even if it comes under a programme  To ensure market access by the Spanish sovereign  the same combination of cheap ECB funding for periphery banks and financial repression of periphery banks by their national authorities that has been effective in lowering sovereign yields since the first LTRO is likely to be required  did concede that the government is taking steps to implement structural reforms It did use this period to pass several important pieces of structural reform legislation  Among these were labour market reforms aimed at reducing severance pay in the long term contract sector  while introducing or raising it in the flexible contract sector   reforms aimed at reducing the scope and incidence of industry wide collective bargaining and replacing it with something closer to firm level or establishment level contracting  the imposition of an additional  50bn provisioning requirement on the banks  and laws aimed at strengthening central government control over the finances of the lower tier authorities  autonomous regions and municipalities     though he was uncertain as to their implementation Passing legislation and implementing it are not the same thing  however  as we know from the Greek experience  In addition  both structural reform and a medium term programme of fiscal austerity based on a politically acceptable formula for fiscal burden sharing look necessary to restore Spain to fiscal sustainability  The new government s decision to wait 100 days to introduce its first budget  in the pursuit of electoral gain  did little to boost Spain s standing in global markets Spain is a too big to fail country within the eurozone  Market angst is starting to rise over the willingness of the Spanish government and the Spanish people to bear the pain of austerity  Will Spain fall and bring down the eurozone in another crisis  I doubt it  This is the back and forth of the Theatre of Europe  but some form of Grand Plan 2 0 compromise will likely emerge  I agree with  at the IE Business School in Madrid who says to not count Spain out in a crisis  Allard  said Spain s biggest problem is investors  lack of faith in the population s willingness to withstand austerity   They don t see the Spanish people in that way  they don t understand how a country can put up with it   she said  Having watched Spain through previous crisis  they are a pretty surprising country  They get behind things  hard things   Allard said   I don t think this is ever going to look like Greece and that s something the markets don t understand   Italy does structural reformOver in Italy  FT recently reported that Mario Monti clashed with the unions over structural reforms  that would give companies more flexibility to fire workers for economic reasons  and he is winning because of weakened opposition  W ith the  labor union  CGIL considerably weaker than a decade ago and with the main political parties in no position to offer a coherent alternative to the present government  political commentators doubt Mr Monti s technocrats risk being driven from office Opinion polls indicate strong public support for Mr Monti in general  although a majority of Italians opposes changing Article 18 which protects workers in the courts from wrongful dismissals for economic reasons  Under the proposed changes  employees would receive compensation but not reintegration back into their workplace Monti is also following the Grand Plan script of structural reforms which pit the young unemployed against their elders  who have secure jobs With nearly a third of young people unemployed  Mr Monti also wants to end Italy s two tier labour market that protects older workers on indefinite contracts but provides little or no security for mostly new hires on short term contracts The politicians are indeed following through with painful structural reforms  In the meantime  there is doubt from the markets that they can implement them even if the legislation is passed  In a typical EU style compromise  some of the legislation will get watered down  but I believe that the pendulum is swinging back and the momentum toward structural reform is inevitable For now  the message for investors is be prepared for some downside volatility out of Europe  But also know that it is likely a temporary hiccup out of which Grand Plan 2 0 will emerge

24709,246224,COHR,The Ways China Can Rebalance,opinion,No matter how sincere its intentions  what Beijing says it will do over the next few years is meaningful only if its policies are both internally consistent and do not violate external constraints  As I proposed two weeks ago  in this post I will try to lay out as logically as possible the economic options available to Beijing  with some discussion of their limitations  Any decision made by Beijing that is not consistent with these options  I will argue  is not worth taking seriously as a prediction of the future To try to work out what these options might be I will begin with two key assumptions  The first is that the fundamental imbalance in China is the very low GDP share of consumption  This low GDP share of consumption  I have always argued  reflects a growth model that systematically forces up the savings rate largely by repressing consumption  which it does by effectively transferring wealth from the household sector  in the form  among others  of very low interest rates  an undervalued currency  and relatively slow wage growth  in order to subsidize and generate rapid GDP growth As a consequence of this consumption repressing growth model  Chinese growth is driven largely by the need to keep investment levels extraordinarily high  What s more  the very high growth rate in investment  combined with significant pricing distortions  especially in the cost of capital  has resulted in massive overinvestment and an unsustainable increase in debt  China cannot slow the growth in debt and resolve its internal economic problems without raising the consumption share of GDP My second major assumption is that China must and will rebalance in the coming years   its imbalances  in other words  cannot get much greater and we will soon see a reversal  There are two reasons for saying this  neither of which has to do with the claims being made by Beijing that they are indeed determined to rebalance the economy The first reason is the debt dynamics  Every country that has followed a consumption repressing investment driven growth model like China s has ended with an unsustainable debt burden caused by wasted debt financed investment  This has always led either to a debt crisis or to a  lost decade  of very low growth At some point the debt burden itself poses a limit to the continuation of the growth model and forces rebalancing towards a higher consumption share of GDP How When debt capacity limits are reached  investment must drop because it can no longer be funded quickly enough to generate growth  When this happens China will automatically rebalance  but it will rebalance through a collapse in GDP growth  which might even go negative  resulting in a rising share of consumption only because consumption does not drop as quickly as GDP Before any journalist reading this decides to write an article with the headline  Peking University Professor Predicts China Collapse   I must stress that I am not saying that a collapse in growth must happen  or even that it is likely to happen  My argument here is only that if the unsustainable rise in debt isn t addressed and reversed  China must eventually reach its debt capacity limit  and this will force a catastrophic rebalancing I expect however that Beijing will begin rebalancing well before we reach the debt capacity limit I will discuss later how Beijing can engineer the rebalancing process  but the point here is just that either Beijing forces rebalancing  or rebalancing will be forced upon China in the form of a debt crisis  One way or the other  in other words  debt will force China to rebalance The second reason for assuming that China will rebalance is because of external constraints  Globally  savings and investment must balance  This means that for any set of countries whose savings exceed investment  like China  there must be countries whose investment exceeds savings  like the US  To put it another way  the world can function with a group of underconsuming countries only if they are balanced by a group of overconsuming countries For the past decade the underconsuming countries of central Europe and Asia  of which China was by far the most important  were balanced by overconsuming countries in peripheral Europe and North America  But conditions are changing  The overconsuming countries are being forced to reduce  in the former case  or are working towards reducing  in the latter case  their overconsumption To the extent they succeed  by definition unless there is a surge in global investment   which given the weak state of the world is very unlikely   underconsuming countries must increase their total consumption rates  or else the world economy cannot balance savings and investment  This global rebalancing must involve China As the biggest source of global underconsumption by far  it is very hard to imagine a world that adjusts without a significant adjustment in China This adjustment won t be easy  especially if Japan  as I argued two weeks ago  is attempting to resolve its excess debt problems by forcing up its savings rate  One way or the other  however  it must happen  either with a surge in consumption in the underconsuming countries or with a fall in production   both of which accomplish the same thing  albeit in very different ways How can China rebalance How plausible are my two assumptions  I think the first one may have been controversial in some quarters as recently as three years ago  and there still are a few who disagree  but it is pretty much accepted among most economists  and it has certainly been a formal part of Beijing s discourse Everyone from Premier Wen and Vice Premier Li on down has insisted that Beijing s consumption imbalance has reached danger levels  and that China must and will rebalance   for example  is the South China Morning Post on the subject  China is landing quite well  Its inflation is down  investment and growth has slowed   said Zhu Min  IMF deputy managing director  yesterday during his first speech in Hong Kong since assuming his new position in July of last year   However  it still needs to carefully manage its investment driven development model  as investment takes up about 48 per cent of gross domestic product  Zhu s words echoed a string of heavyweight calls for reform  including ones from Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier Li Keqiang and scholars at China s central bank and the national state council Li said over the weekend that  reforms have entered a tough stage   and that  China has reached a crucial period in changing its economic model and  change  cannot be delayed  The fear is that the current situation  in which exports and investment contribute to most of China s GDP growth  is no longer sustainable  Export growth to Europe  the largest trading partner with China  had dropped almost to zero  and an investment driven economy had left the country with a huge pile of debt that could potentially go sour  economists said My second assumption   that China will necessarily rebalance in the next few years   is I think also very plausible  In fact over the long run it is actually more than just plausible It is an arithmetical certainty because it can only be violated if China has unlimited borrowing capacity and if the world has unlimited appetite for rising China trade surpluses  Neither is true Where some analysts might disagree with my second assumption is in the issue of timing  China bulls continue to argue that there isn t yet a significant overinvestment problem in China  which implies that debt is not rising at an unsustainable pace  or if it is  that it can continue rising for many more years before the debt burden itself becomes unsustainable This  for example  is the view of the folks at Dragonomics  and it is a view often expressed sympathetically in The Economist This disagreement with my assumption also implies that the consumption imbalance is temporary and can resolve itself gradually and over time as the benefits of earlier investment begin to emerge and eventually overwhelm the total costs of those investments  Of course if this is true China does not need a surging current account surplus because if investment isn t being wasted it can keep investment rising faster than savings for many more years  The current account surplus  remember  is just the excess of savings over investment The key vulnerability of my argument  then  is whether or not you think investment in the aggregate is being misallocated in China and has been for many years  If you agree that it has  and that it has reached unsustainable levels  then you must also agree that consumption must become a greater share of GDP over the next five to ten years  What s more  you should also agree that the only way to increase the consumption share of GDP is to increase the household income  or wealth  share of GDP  China  in other words  must stop transferring income from households to the state and in fact must reverse those transfers As Chinese household income and wealth become a greater share of the overall economy  so will Chinese consumption  This is the key prediction  and it implies that one way or the other Beijing will engineer a transfer of wealth from the state sector to the hosuehold sector As I see it  the various ways in which this transfer can take place can all be accounted for by one or more of the five following options Beijing can slowly reverse the transfers  for example by gradually raising real interest rates  the foreign exchange value of the currency  and wages  or by lowering income and consumption taxes Beijing can quickly reverse the transfers in the same way Beijing can directly transfer wealth from the state sector to the private sector by privatizing assets and using the proceeds directly or indirectly to boost household wealth Beijing can transfer wealth from the state sector to the private sector by absorbing private sector debt Beijing can cut investment sharply  resulting in a collapse in growth  but it can mitigate the employment impact of this collapse by hiring unemployed workers for various make work programs and paying their salaries out of state resources Notice that all of these options effectively have China doing the same thing  In each case the state share of GDP is reduced and the household share is increased  There are however very big differences in how the changes are distributed among various parts of the household sector and the state sector Notice also that the changing share of GDP tells us little or nothing about the actual GDP growth rate  or about the growth rate either of household wealth or of state wealth  It just tells us something very important about the relative growth rates  For example we can posit a case in which GDP grows by 9  annually while household income grows by 12 13  annually In that case the rest of the economy would grow by roughly 5 6  annually  household income is approximately half of GDP   and the distribution of this growth would be shared between the sate sector and the business sector  This might be considered the  good case  scenario of rebalancing Alternatively  we can posit that annual GDP growth is 0   In that case the annual growth in household income might be 3 4  while the state and business sectors contract at roughly 3 4   This would be the  bad case  scenario The political economy of rebalancingIt is worth making three points about these different scenarios  First  in both cases China rebalances  but the way in which it rebalances can have very different growth implications  Second  notice that even in the bad case  household income growth can be quite robust  which means that fears of social instability as Chinese growth slows are very exaggerated if a slowdown in Chinese growth occurs with real rebalancing But   and this is the third point   that s not all  The real cost of the rebalancing  it turns out  falls on the state sector  and we will have to keep this in mind as we consider the choices that Beijing must make Remember that for the past twenty years  and especially in the past ten years  the state and business share of a rapidly growing economic pie was also growing  which meant extraordinary growth in the value of assets controlled by the state sector  The household share of the growing economic pie of course contracted  but the rapid growth in the pie ensured that households nonetheless saw their income grow quite rapidly even as their share of total income declined When we reverse this process  as we must if there is to be rebalancing  any slowdown in GDP growth will be minimally felt by the household sector  if the rebalancing is managed in an orderly way   but even a scenario of very high GDP growth must result in much slower growth in the value of state sector income and assets  Of course if GDP growth actually slows sharply  which I expect it will  the growth in the value of state sector assets will collapse and perhaps even turn negative In my opinion this change in the growth rate of the state sector will be at the heart of the political economy choices  and difficulties  that Beijing will be forced to address in the next few years  It is likely to be much easier to keep political leaders happy when the value of the state sector is growing comfortably in the double digit range than it is when it is growing in low single digits  or even contracting Minxin Pei from Claremont McKenna  and also the Carnegie Endowment  implicitly makes a similar argument in a clear and intelligent recent  for Project Syndicate  In it he says When sound economic advice is divorced from political reality  it probably will not be very useful advice  The history of multilateral financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is littered with well intentioned and technically feasible economic policy prescriptions that political leaders ignored  But that has not stopped these institutions from trying The latest attempt is the World Bank s just released and much applauded report China 2030  Building a Modern  Harmonious  and Creative High Income Society  As far as technical economic advice goes  the report is hard to top  It provides a detailed  thoughtful  and honest diagnosis of the Chinese economy s structural and institutional flaws  and calls for coherent and bold reforms to remove these fundamental obstacles to sustainable growth Unfortunately  while the Bank s report has laid out a clear economic course that Chinese leaders should pursue for the sake of China  the Bank has shied away from the most critical question  Will the Chinese government actually heed its advice and swallow the bitter medicine  given the country s one party political system Pei argues that there are serious political constraints to Beijing s ability to force the necessary reforms recommended by the World Bank For example when it comes to reducing the power of inefficient and wasteful state owned enterprises There is little doubt that reducing the SOEs  power would make the Chinese economy far more efficient and dynamic  But it is hard to imagine that a one party regime would be willing to destroy its political base The consequences of rebalancingIn a sense Pei makes the same argument I do  but from a different angle  I say that you can discuss as much as you like what Beijing proclaims it will do  but what it actually does will necessarily be constrained by what is economically possible  Pei says you can talk all you want about what economic policies Beijing will follow  but what it actually does will necessarily be constrained by what is politically possible  If you were to superimpose Pei s political constraints on top of my economic constraints  you would presumably be left with a much more accurate measure of what can actually happen I leave the politics of economic decision making to people like Minxin Pei and UC San Diego s Victor Shih  but in thinking about the economic constraints it might be useful to examine each of the five options I have listed above This allows us to see what the consequences for growth each of the options might involve  what disadvantages they have  and how they would play out Beijing can slowly reverse the transfers  for example by gradually raising real interest rates  raising the foreign exchange value of the currency  and raising wages  or by lowering income and consumption taxes  This path simply means the reversal of the process over the last decade during which the imbalances were created Beijing can slowly reverse the transfers  for example by gradually raising real interest rates  raising the foreign exchange value of the currency  and raising wages  or by lowering income and consumption taxes  This path simply means the reversal of the process over the last decade during which the imbalances were created  Repressed interest rates transfer wealth from household depositors to state and business borrowers  so interest rates must be gradually raised to approach nominal GDP growth rates  and as this happens the hidden transfers will be reduced to zero or close to zero  An undervalued currency transfers wealth from households to the tradable goods sector  so the value of the currency must be raised  and this will cause the transfer to drop to zero  Low wage growth transfers wealth from workers to employers  so rising wages should be encouraged  and this growth in wages relative to productivity will reduce the transfer to zero Positives This policy fits into the gradualism which has pretty much been the default setting for most Chinese economic policymaking since the dramatic reforms put into place by Zhu Rongji  China s Vice Premier and Premier in  of economic policymaking until 2003  Since China s export success and economic growth depends heavily on hidden subsidies from the household sector  this strategy allows the subsidies to be removed slowly so that Chinese businesses have time to adapt  As they do  the adverse employment impact of removing the subsidies can be counterbalanced by the positive employment impact of rising household consumption  so that there is no surge in unemployment NegativesRebalancing is inflationary  As rebalancing forces consumption up relative to production  we will see a reduction in China s ability to keep inflation down even in the face of rapid monetary growth  In fact this is likely to be the case under any of the rebalancing scenarios   inflationary pressures will increase as the policies that kept inflation in check by constraining consumption growth are eased   However it is worth noting that most Chinese inflation until now has been food intensive and so has resulted in significant transfers of wealth from the poor  for whom food is an important component of consumption  to the rich  for whom it isn t  Inflation under the rebalancing scenario will not primarily affect the food sector and is far more likely to affect the rich and middle classes  In that sense it might be less socially disruptive for the poor The biggest problem with this strategy is that it is too slow and too late   Five or six years ago Beijing could have begun rebalancing gradually  but Beijing no longer has enough time  Remember that the total value of these subsidies are enormous   for example I have cited in earlier newsletters studies that suggest that the value of hidden subsidies to the SOE sector in the past decade may be anywhere from five to eight times their aggregate profitability   This means that gradually removing the subsidies at a pace the Chinese economy can handle will result in worsening domestic imbalances for many years before there has been enough of an adjustment  During this time the impact of those distortions   declining consumption relative to GDP  misallocated investment  and rising debt  above all   will continue to grow The more bad investment China accumulates  the more costly the eventual adjustment will be and the more the adjustment process must be slowed  Gradual adjustment increases the risk of China s reaching debt capacity limits to almost near certainty  It is too risky  in other words  for China to adjust gradually  even though Beijing would like nothing better  and some of the policymakers in Beijing seem to realize this  2   Beijing can quickly reverse the transfers by forcing up real interest rates in the next two years  raising the foreign exchange value of the currency in a large one off revaluation  and raising wages quickly Positives  By adjusting very quickly Beijing would immediately put a stop to the worsening of the domestic imbalances  it would eliminate the strong incentives within China to waste money on a stability threatening scale  and it would allow Beijing finally to get a grip on its ballooning debt NegativesEliminating the hidden subsidies abruptly would cause a massive increase in financial distress  This would lead almost certainly to a surge in unemployment as exporters and borrowers are forced into closing down operations   In the short term  rather than see household income in the aggregate rise  we would probably see household income decline because the negative impact of rising unemployment would exceed the positive impact of reversing the wealth transfers  The feedback effect of declining household consumption could force the economy into a downward spiral  much like that of the US during the Great Depression    China s economy would still rebalance in this case   probably through negative growth in household income and even more negative GDP growth   but it would rebalance under very difficult economic and social conditions   Needless to say this would also result in difficult political conditions 3   Beijing can directly transfer wealth from the state sector to the private sector by effectively privatizing assets and using the proceeds directly or indirectly to boost household wealth Positives This is the most efficient way to increase household wealth at the expense of the state sector  Beijing could transfer wealth directly  by giving peasants land  by giving households shares in state owned companies  by privatizing state assets and using the proceeds to shore up the social safety net  or in a number of other ways   It can also do so indirectly by selling and privatizing assets and using the proceeds to shore up the banks or to clean up loans   Remember that non performing loans  which for our purpose should include loans that would be non performing if lending rates were raised to levels that eliminated the hidden subsidy  represent a future claim on the household sector  By eliminating this future claim  household wealth will immediately increase   and this would most likely manifest itself as higher deposit rates returned to depositors  The combination of privatization plus the elimination of subsidized capital would eliminate the tendency for the Chinese financial system to waste capital on a massive scale NegativesTransferring assets from the sate sector directly or indirectly is only meaningful in the context of a significant reform in corporate governance  As the whole  vested interests  debate in China suggests  and as the Minxin Pei essay I cited above argues  there is tremendous resistance to the loss of power and control this would impose on many important and powerful sectors and families within China 4   Beijing can transfer wealth from the state sector to the private sector by absorbing private sector debt  This is what Japan did after 1990  when government debt rose from roughly 20  of GDP to the 200 250  of GDP as the government effectively absorbed the bad loans in the banking sector  This may at first seem counterintuitive as a form of wealth transfer  but remember that my taking over your debt has the same net impact on your and my wealth as my giving you my assets  In either case I am transferring wealth to you  How does this benefit the household sector  Mainly because as corporate debt is absorbed by the state it allows them to stay in business  i e  not fire workers  and expand even while wages are rising  and it is rising wages that will increase household income  Positives This turns out to be very easy to do politically because it does not entail taking away assets  or the control over those assets  from anyone NegativesAs we saw in the case with Japan  this strategy eventually leaves the government after a decade or so struggling with too much debt  The debt burden itself becomes the biggest impediment to growth since the direct or hidden taxes required to service it reduce consumption driven growth  and the size of the debt limits policy choices for the government This strategy also prevents the right kind of interest rate adjustment because the burgeoning government debt forces the central bank to keep interest rates low or risk government insolvency  In the end interest rates must adjust one way or the other  and the only way Japan was able to raise real interest rates to their  natural  level  and so prevent the worsening of investment misallocation  was through annual GDP growth rates of less than 1   Since the gap between the nominal lending rate and the nominal growth rate is essentially the measure of the subsidy that net depositors provide to net borrowers  as growth rates dropped  so did the financial repression tax 5   Beijing can cut investment sharply  resulting in a collapse in growth  but it can mitigate the employment impact of this collapse by hiring unemployed workers for various make work programs and paying their salaries out of state resources  Hiring unemployed and unproductive workers means a transfer of wealth from the state to the workers   If this transfer is paid for by the household sector  through explicit taxes or through hidden taxes  like higher financial repression taxes caused by expanded government borrowing   it will have a minimal impact on household consumption  If it is paid for out of state assets  it will improve household consumption Positives This protects workers from rising unemployment NegativesHiring and paying unproductive workers is extremely inefficient and can only be a temporary solution to the rebalancing problem  More importantly  it doesn t address the fundamental problem of how these payments are to be funded How will Beijing choose As I see it these are ultimately the only options   or at least the major set of options   Beijing can choose to follow over the next few years if it wants to avoid a debt crisis  Of course Beijing doesn t have to choose only one of the above options  What is more likely in fact is that policymakers end up choosing a combination For example we can posit the following  Beijing can choose an intermediate path between the first and second options  and raise interest rates sharply over the next two or three years while also raising the value of the RMB by 10 15  in an overnight maxi revaluation In order to protect workers from the resulting surge in unemployment  Beijing can instruct state owned companies and local governments temporarily to hire a huge number of workers for make work programs  the fifth option  and initially pay for this by increasing borrowing  the fourth option  At the same time it can begin a massive program of privatization  which should include transferring ownership of land to peasants  and selling off assets and using the proceeds to shore up the social safety net and to pay down debt in the banking system This would certainly work economically to rebalance China in a way that guarantees fairly high growth rates over the rest of the decade  but is it politically possible  Here I would defer to Minxin Pei  who might argue that the scale of privatization required is not possible politically  In that case China would end up being forced into rebalancing via the fourth option  with a long term surge in government debt And this is my point  If you believe my assumptions are correct  then you should agree that China has no choice but to follow one or more of these paths  If privatization is not an option  then a collapse in the economy caused by a rapid adjustment in interest rates and the currency  the second option  might be  If that is ruled out  then perhaps the outcome will be a surge in government debt  the fourth option again   and so on This what I mean by the economic constraints that limit the choices Beijing can make  It doesn t matter what anyone thinks or wants Beijing to do  if the plan violates the economic constraints  it cannot be done  To be really complete we should outline the political constraints  the environmental constraints  the demographic constraints  the external trade constraints  and so on  although of course this is way beyond my ability  but each of these exercises allows us to escape from the confusion of stated intentions and to

there is none  Second  Europe needs a major firewall to shoot down the vultures who are circling Spain and  to a slightly lesser extent  Italy  Europe s existing firewall is insufficient to deal with either one  if you look at the numbers honestly  let alone both at the same time  Third  both Italy and Spain desperately need real labor reform  but with Italian  superstar  Prime Minister Mario Monti caving into parliament and signing off on very weak measures  and Spain s parliament not likely to accept anything approaching what s needed there  the crisis will be hitting full force before long This week  Spain s 10 year bond traded with a yield over 5 80   the highest since December  while Italy s 10 year was back up to 5 50   If both economies were growing at 2  to 3   you could live with those rates when weighing future refinancing needs  but knowing both are in recession  with Spain basically in depression when you consider its new record high 23 6  unemployment rate  50  among the youth   there is no way yields will remain below 6 00  But you know all those stories about the LTROs  the long term refinancing operations  If I told you both Italian and Spanish paper is now at yields higher than December  what does that mean  It means the banks that sopped up all the essentially free cash and then reinvested it in higher yielding Spanish and Italian government debt  which is what the European Central Bank wanted the financial institutions to do  now have losses on those very same bonds  in some cases substantial ones  Which means what  The capital structure of these banks could be screwed up all over again  Which means what  If rates continue to inch higher  and the losses on the paper grow  they ll have to raise more capital  Where will they find said capital  Beats the crap out of me  Cue the Homer Simpson blank stare I mean think about it  Europe legitimately thought that with the two LTROs  they bought about a year or so to get their fiscal house in order  helped by the fact that by year end  most euro economies would be back in solid growth mode  Well  the state of calm lasted about a quarter And if you think various euro nations  such as Germany  Finland and the Netherlands  are anxious to put their taxpayers further on the hook to increase the size of the firewall for Italy and Spain  then you re just not dealing with reality But here are some stats on the euro region economy  as if you needed more bad news  The PMI on manufacturing for the 17 nations sharing the currency came in at 47 7 for March vs  49 in February  Germany was at 48 4  a 3 month low  France at 46 7  a 33 month low  Spain at 44 5  and Greece  41 3  to name a few The eurozone unemployment rate hit 10 8  in February  latest available   the highest in 14  years  You saw Spain s rate  Italy s  at 9 3   is a cycle high  plus youth unemployment there is 32    The good figures come from Austria  just 4 2   Netherlands  4 9   and Germany  5 7   Spain s parliament is debating  36 billion in further austerity cuts  as mandated by the ECB and EC  but its big problem is the  regions   who represent 50  of government spending  The central government is reasonably transparent  from what I know  in its finances  but the regions are hopelessly corrupt  It was the regions  after all  that fueled the housing bubble which I documented so well in this space  one in which the level of corruption between the developers and municipal governments was off the charts  both being in cahoots with the banks  all three hiding the damage on their respective books  Actually  the developers didn t keep any books  They just left town No wonder Spain s Prime Minister Rajoy  who s wondering why he wanted the job  said his nation was in  extreme difficulty  Then there is Greece  You remember them  A heartbreaking event occurred this week as a 77 year old pensioner shot himself in the head outside parliament  not wanting to leave his family with debts  It s the kind of tragedy that galvanizes a nation  In the alleged suicide note  he said   The government has annihilated all traces for my survival  which was based on a very dignified pension that I alone paid for 35 years with no help from the state  And since my advanced age does not allow me a way of dynamically reacting I see no other solution than this dignified end to my life  so I don t find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance  Crowds soon formed and there were violent  albeit small  clashes with riot police  but these particular demonstrations could grow as they now have a symbol of their despair  WashingtonStocks finished lower for this holiday shortened week  and are likely to open lower on Monday  following a disappointing jobs report for March  with the economy only adding 120 000 jobs when 205 000 was the consensus estimate   The unemployment rate ticked down to 8 2  from 8 3  only because the labor pool shrunk  as in more people stopped looking   While the stock market was closed  Friday  the futures market was open and stocks dropped 1  or thereabouts  foretelling Monday s open Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke looks a little prescient  for once  as he s been warning the recent employment gains could fizzle  and the Fed s minutes from its March 13 meeting did indicate that some members of the Open Market Committee were concerned  additional stimulus could become necessary if the economy lost momentum or if inflation seemed likely to remain below  2  So while at the time the financial markets took the March minutes as a sign there was decreased urgency for further stimulus  or QE3  with Friday s poor jobs data  QE3 could be back on the table and that in turn could help soften the blow on Monday One thing is for sure  The economy has slowed  despite strong largely weather related auto and retail sales But this was a week where everyone all at once seemed to focus on the deficit  and the looming train wreck following the election and a lame duck Congress that will be faced with deciding the fate of the Bush tax cuts  limits to entitlement spending  and the automatic budget cuts already planned  the  sequester  that takes effect Jan  1 unless Congress acts beforehand  Plus  there is a very good chance we ll have another debt ceiling debate  not just prior to year end  but possibly before the election itself So we re talking about a truly tumultuous finish to the year  which will begin to give people the heebie jeebies no later than mid summer as in I like my call for a crash  as first enunciated middle of last year  better and better  A crash  you understand  exacerbated by the computer program high frequency traders that the SEC  almost two years after the Flash Crash  is still just  investigating   I mean seriously  folks  I don t mention the articles that come almost every week talking of a new SEC investigation because the bottom line is they haven t done anything  and these HFT players will one day screw us all worse than before Mohamed El Erian   Financial Times The hesitancy  in hiring  is understandable  particularly given the uncertain outlook for demand  American consumers  as a group  still carry too much debt and have to cope with higher oil prices  The prospects for exports  which have grown markedly  are gradually dimming now that the rest of the world is slowing  Meanwhile  policymakers have yet to find a way to deal properly with a year end fiscal cliff  the result of Washington s repeated inability to design coherent fiscal policy   After a period of relative calm  Friday s employment report should again sound alarm bells in many parts of Washington  The combined risk of an unemployment problem that is increasingly structural in nature and a rate that is bottoming out way too soon is bad news  It is the last thing America and  more broadly  the global economy need  especially at a time when Europe remains fragile  The hope is that Friday s report will act as a catalyst for a renewed initiative on the part of Congress and the administration to lift the impediments to growth that have been repeatedly identified yet never suitably treated  More likely  however  is that political bickering and dithering may again deliver a depressingly familiar seasonal pattern that undermines the wellbeing of millions and renders the subsequent recovery even more difficult to secure  Speaking of bickering  President Obama blasted the House Republican budget of Rep  Paul Ryan  Wis    calling it a  radical proposal   a  Trojan horse  and  a prescription for decline   This is now the party s governing platform  It is thinly veiled social Darwinism  House Speaker John Boehner replied  Instead of reaching across the aisle to enact the changes needed to restore America s prosperity  the president has resorted to distortions and partisan potshots  and recommitted himself to policies that have made our country s debt crisis worse  What s so incredibly stupid  and infuriating  about this debate is that broadly speaking we are only talking about reducing the rate of growth in the federal budget  But President Obama is flat out lying in his descriptions of the Ryan plan  Nor does he refuse to level with the American people on entitlements  let alone his fellow Democrats  among which  in case you haven t noticed  is not one not one leader among the bunch these days  Congressman Chris Van Hollen  Puh leeze Editorial   Wall Street Journal The President s depiction of the wonkish and formerly obscure House Budget Chairman as some political monster is itself telling  Mr  Obama is conceding that he can t run on the economic recovery  the stimulus  health care  green energy or any of the other grand liberal ambitions that have dominated his time in office  All of those are unpopular or failures  He was elected on hope and change  but now his only hope is to change the subject to the ogres he claims are the disloyal opposition   The list of untrue things that Mr  Obama wants Americans to believe is evidently so long that Mr  Obama associated himself with Republicans  albeit mostly dead Republicans like Lincoln and Eisenhower  For the first time we can recall  Mr  Obama even praised George W  Bush  of all people  because his predecessor created a new entitlement for prescription drugs  He also said Newt Gingrich showed how smart he was when he called Mr  Ryan s budget  radical  and  right wing social engineering  last year  All of this in a political fable carefully constructed to erase the record of the last three years and blame every current anxiety on a GOP House that has been in office for all of 14 months  The President claims to have  eliminated dozens of programs that weren t working   but the savings from these eliminations amount to less than 0 1  of the budget  or less than  100 million  Meanwhile  the budget has grown by more than 20  since he has been President  After deficits of  1 412 trillion   1 293 trillion  and  1 299 trillion over the last three years  and an estimated  1 326 trillion due for 2012  he still claims the deficits are all Mr  Bush s fault   except for the extra spending on Medicare  which he likes  It is especially rich of Mr  Obama to accuse Republicans of breaking last summer s debt limit deal   given that even the most sympathetic press accounts that are now emerging make it clear that the President blew up his  big deal  with John Boehner  The House Speaker was prepared to trade higher taxes for mostly notional changes to entitlements  but Mr  Obama thought he could roll him at the last minute for even greater tax increases   The last two days have revealed Mr  Obama at his least appealing   and least Presidential   first warning the Supreme Court not to dare overturn his health care law  and now demonizing the motives of his political opposition  It is a long  long way from his  there s no red America  there s no blue America  stuff of 2004  much less the inspiration of 2008  If nothing else  Americans are getting a preview of the rhetorical uplift  the bipartisan problem solving  and the unifying national purpose that would attend another four years  ,2012-04-09,Brian Trumbore,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review-part-i:-europe,-washington-and-wall-street-119507",119507
24711,246226,COHR,The Economy Is Not All That Hot,opinion,This week another pundit again confirmed the economy is headed toward a recession  Rail  a real time economic indicator is now negative year over year regardless of interpretation    Many view the economy with their favorite pulse point   say GDP   which is a very  very lagging indicator  Hello people  GDP is continually revised  and the last recession was called a year after the revised and revised GDP estimate at that time started contracting    Looking at the myriad of non GDP economic releases individually will drive one crazy as elements of the economy are not necessarily in phase with each other  and there are reasons which depress or fuel each economic segments    Overall  the economy seems to be more robust then the weak growth indicates   but one must look for outliers which would indicate an alternate conclusion   The pundit repeating his recession call this week was   He also called for the S P to fall to 800  a 43  fall  My nagging concern that there are few USA economic segments where growth is accelerating  all while the stimulus effects ebb and global growth projections are slowing A timely way to look at the economy is the Federal Revenues  which are mostly from various taxes   Monthly Federal income is reported shortly after month end  and logic dictates that as long as the tax rate laws are unchanged   it should be a good indicator of the economy   One problem using tax revenues is that they are noisy   and to obtain any sort of coherent output requires viewing the revenues as a 3 month rolling average  On the other hand  backward revision is statistically unnoticed if it happens at all    Looking at Federal Revenues as a recession indicator   they began contracting year over year in July 2001  vs the NBER recession start date of March 2001 which was announced on November 26  2001   and in February 2008  vs the NBER recession call start  of December 2007 which was announced in December 1  2008   The point here is that even being a little late in indicating a recession had begun  that monitoring Federal Tax Revenues is far faster  and more accurate in real time  than using the continuously revised GDP as a metric to understanding the real economy    Growth in Federal Revenues over the last 8 months has averaged an annual rate of growth of 2 8    and the 7 month growth trend is more or less flat  stable   The scary part is that historically this low rate of Federal Revenue growth is not normal    The whole economy just seems not to be acting in a historically normal manner  Those pundits that have called a recession are looking at trusted economic elements which are indicating contraction  I trust nothing at this point in this New Normal recovery    Other Economic News this Week   The Econintersect economic forecast for  shows a less good growth  There has been a degradation in our government and finished goods pulse points  ECRI has   Their data looks ahead at least 6 months and the bottom line for them is that a recession is a certainty  The size and depth is unknown but the recession start has been revised to hit   This week ECRI s WLI index value improved to 1 4   the best index value since August 2011  This is the twelfth week of index improvement  This index is now indicating the economy six months from today will be marginally better than today Initial unemployment claims essentially increased from 357 000  reported last week  to 380 000  Historically  claims exceeding 400 000 per week usually occur when employment gains are less than the workforce growth  resulting in an increasing unemployment rate  background  and    The real gauge   the 4 week moving average   rose from 361 750  reported last week  to 368 500  Because of the noise  week to week movements from abnormal events AND the backward revisions to previous weeks releases   the 4 week average remains the reliable gauge Data released this week which contained economically intuitive components  forward looking  were  and the import portion of the trade balance   Although overall rail is contracting year over year  economic related components are weakly improving  The growth in imports has always been a positive sign of USA economic growth Weekly Economic Release Scorecard  to view the scorecard table below with active hyperlinksBankruptcy this Week  Reddy Ice Holdings and Reddy Ice CorporationFailed Banks this Week  None,2012-04-14,Steven Hansen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-economy-is-not-all-that-hot-120116,120116
24712,246227,COHR,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,Rick Santorum bowed out of the Republican presidential nomination race  leaving Mitt Romney to finally focus on President Obama in what I first wrote last fall will be the ugliest race since 1860  Santorum was behind in the polls in his native Pennsylvania  which holds its primary on April 24  the delegate math wasn t in his favor  and he is in debt Needless to say there remains bad blood between the Romney and Santorum camps and to his credit  Santorum did win 11 states  but that took a toll on Romney  as some of the below polling shows  Romney also had to spend millions beating back Santorum  campaign dollars he had hoped to use in the general election campaign against the president  At the end of February  Romney s campaign coffers had about  7 2 million to President Obama s  84 million  though both war chests will now grow  including the ability to tap party resources Obama told donors this week   This election will probably have the biggest contrast that we ve seen maybe since the Johnson Goldwater election  maybe before that  Romney replied on Tuesday   This game  this populism of trying to go and divide America  is not only wrong  it s dangerous  John Podhoretz   New York Post Mitt Romney s nomination was certain as long ago as December because he was  when it came right down to it  the only serious candidate in the race   the only candidate who combined intense preparation on issues  an overarching and coherent theme and the necessary fund raising prowess to prevail in a contest dominated by cringe inducing silliness  Yes  Santorum tied Romney in Iowa and Newt Gingrich blew Romney away in South Carolina   but even then  even serious political types who didn t want to see Romney as the nominee couldn t quite envision a way for either of the others to actually win   For most of the past year  the political coverage of Romney on both right and left has centered on his weaknesses   how he s failed to stir Republican passions  how he s been inconstant in his positions over time  how he put his dog on the roof of his car in 1983  how his profession of a minority faith is problematic  But today  perhaps  it s worth taking a moment to look at Romney s demonstrable strengths  He spent three years patiently building an organization  state by state   which proved exceptionally important with the primary rule changes initiated by the GOP in 2010  He became extraordinarily fluent on the issues  This was notable because  in his 2008 run  he d been quite ham fisted and inarticulate on matters that hadn t been in his wheelhouse as Massachusetts governor  In part as a result of his command of material and his understanding of the importance of tone  he was without question the most impressive and strategic performer over the course of the 20 GOP debates   And Romney showed a talent for aggressive confrontation without appearing obnoxious  He took Rick Perry out practically single handedly in their first face to face encounter and took Newt Gingrich down in two successive knockouts between South Carolina and Florida  Finally  he showed that he could dish it out when he inundated his rivals with well conceived negative ads that left them sputtering impotently   a mark of the toughness he is going to need to face President Obama in the fall  Perhaps even more important  he showed that he could take it   that he could withstand Newtmania and the Santorum Surge without melting down  panicking  losing faith or changing his strategy to satisfy the demands of pundits who didn t necessarily wish him well  That ability to stand his ground and maintain his sangfroid will also stand him in good stead against his formidable Democratic rival  Time to get on with it  then  In a Washington Post ABC News poll  President Obama has double digit leads over Romney on who would do a better job of protecting the middle class  addressing women s issues  handling international affairs and dealing with health care  Obama has a better than 2 to 1 advantage as the more likable of the two  64 26   And Romney faces a huge deficit among female voters Obama s overall approval rating remains at 50   but nearly half of all Americans say his handling of the economy is a major reason to oppose his reelection  Romney s only big advantage is on the issue of who would do a better job dealing with the federal budget deficit  51 38  In a Romney Obama matchup  with the poll being held prior to Santorum s exit  the president holds a 51 44 lead Romney trails by 19 among women  Obama won the demographic by 13 points in 2008   The president  on the other hand  loses white men with college degrees by a 57 39 margin 76  of Americans say the economy is still in recession  even though by definition the recession ended three years ago A story on ten swing states for 2012 in the Wall Street Journal  in conjunction with the Cook Political Report  shows that Obama leads Romney in all ten  though he also won them in 2008 Colorado  Florida  Iowa  Nevada  New Hampshire  North Carolina  Ohio  Pennsylvania  Virginia and Wisconsin Dick Morris   Eileen McGann   New York Post The shape of President Obama s reelection strategy is coming clear  The key elements   1  Don t run on your record  run as if there were no incumbent   2  Stress class warfare  exploit fear of Republican spending cuts  Harp on the negatives   3  Hide the negatives about your record in a miasma of general pessimism   Medicare was broken before we got here  headwinds slowed the economy     Obama s appeals to fear  envy and class antagonisms haven t been working lately  But even if they start to  he s sacrificing the themes of optimism and hope  A dour  bitter Obama  lashing out at the rich and peddling fear of the Republicans  can t compete with a sunny  smiling Mitt Romney  He s largely stuck talking about who Romney is   an unbecoming attack line that doesn t inspire faith in a national leader  Were we France or Italy  perhaps this rhetoric would fall on receptive ears conditioned by years of discord  Here in America  Not yet  Democrats from President Obama on down were left scrambling after party strategist Hilary Rosen  a CNN contributor  said of Mitt Romney s wife  Ann   His wife has actually never worked a day in her life  She s never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of women in this country are facing  Doh  It was the wrong thing to say   President Obama declared   There s no tougher job than being a mom That s work  so  anybody who would argue otherwise probably needs to rethink their statement   Michelle Obama tweeted her own support for women and mothers Ann Romney tweeted for the first time   I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys  Believe me  it was hard work  She later said on Fox News  Other women make other choices  to have a career and raise family  which I think Hilary Rosen has actually done herself  I respect that  that s wonderful  But  you know  there are other people that have a choice  We have to respect women and all those choices that they make  And  by the way  let me give a shout out to all the dads that are at home raising kids  Rosen s communications and public relations firm  SKD Knickerbocker  where she is a managing director  has been paid  120 000 by the Democratic National Committee in this election cycle  She later rethought her stance  I apologize to Ann Romney and anyone else who was offended  Let s declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance  At a conference in Manhattan  New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie said America has become a couch potato nation  citing a  paternalistic entitlement society   I ve never seen a less optimistic time in my lifetime in this country   Christie added  the government is now telling people    Stop dreaming  stop striving  we ll take care of you    That will not just bankrupt us financially  it will bankrupt us morally  because when the American people no longer believe that this is a place where only their willingness to work hard and to act with honor and integrity and ingenuity determines their success in life  then we ll have a bunch of people sitting on a couch  waiting for their next government check   I think politicians get themselves into the biggest trouble when they care more about being loved than being respected  That s why we run up these deficits we run up  That s why we can t say no to anything  because we care too much about being loved  9 11 mastermind  Khalid Sheik Mohammed  and four of his henchmen will be arraigned on May 5 at a Guantanamo Bay military tribunal  They face the death penalty  Of course some wonder why this wasn t done sooner George Zimmerman was

murder in the second degree  Zimmerman would face a maximum sentence of life in prison  Zimmerman pled not guilty  Trayvon s mother  Sybrina Fulton  admitted on  Today  on Thursday that her son s death was  an accident  Newsweek conducted an exclusive poll on race relations in America  Among their findings Back in 2008  52  of Americans told Pew Research Center that they expected race relations to get better as a result of Obama s election  only 9  anticipated a decline But today that 43 point gap has vanished  According to the Newsweek survey  only 32  of Americans now think that race relations have improved since the president s inauguration  30  believe they have gotten worse 51  of whites believe Obama s been unhelpful in bridging the country s racial divide  But when Newsweek asked  Is racism a big problem today in America  60  of blacks think yes  Only 19  of whites agree Was Trayvon Martin s death racially motivated  80  of blacks said yes  31  of whites agreed 78  of blacks believe President Obama s comments about the shooting were appropriate  Only 28  of whites felt they were Interesting story in the Wall Street Journal on the recent surge in priestly

24732,246247,COHR,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Syria  Pathetic U N  special envoy and house sitter extraordinaire  Kofi Annan  said the level of violence post  the April 12 cease fire was  unacceptable   and the Bashar al Assad regime shuddered  Hours after the U N  sent a team to Hama  government troops opened fire on those who came out to support the monitors  killing at least 30  while at the same time there is zero evidence Syria has withdrawn heavy weapons from populated areas as required by the April 12 agreement French foreign minister Alain Juppe said he was giving the peace plan put forward by Annan until May 5 to show it was working or France would seek a resolution in the U N  authorizing force Fouad Ajami   Wall Street Journal The ongoing Kofi Annan diplomacy and United Nations brokered  cease fire  are seen for what they are   an alibi for the abdication of Western powers  and a lifeline for the regime   In the Syria deliberations  deliverance is always around the corner  American diplomacy is always on the verge of making Russia see its way to the proper path  In these tortured discussions  there is no end to finesse and to the parsing of things   In one of its alibis for passivity  the Obama administration falls back on the threat posed by Islamists within the ranks of the opposition  This is but a recycling of the Assad regime s own assertions that its tyranny is a secular shield for the minorities and a barrier to the rise of the Islamists  Yet the surest way the Islamists and the jihadists can come to greater power in Syria is a drawn out war that further degrades and radicalizes the country  The defining truth of this struggle is the abdication of the Obama administration  For a year now  American officials have skillfully run out the clock  They made much of the authority of the U N  Security Council when any model U N  team in any high school would have predicted the vetoes of Russia and China  It was clear that the Obama administration did not want to arm the opposition for fear of  escalating  the conflict   In the markets in Dubai  the Assad dictatorship is dumping its gold reserves   at a discount  In the long run  this regime is doomed  But that is hardly consolation to an outgunned rebellion  We shouldn t be waiting on a Syrian Srebrenica before the regime is pushed into its grave  It is a waste of time   and of precious lives   to buy into a wishful diplomacy that maintains that a few hundred U N  observers will ward off the evils of a merciless sectarian tyranny  Benny Avni   New York Post Should we carve out safe zones to protect civilians  Nah  it would require boots on the ground  even though these need not be U S  troops   Establish no fly zones  Nah  Syrian air defenses are too formidable  although Israel easily disabled them in 2007   Arm the opposition  Sorry  we don t want to militarize the conflict further  By default  we re stuck with a failing plan that we ll likely support and finance anyway  Administration foreign policy hands who might advocate a more muscular approach are no match for Obama s political advisers  who want no election year complications     How is it that Assad is still in power   Elie Wiesel asked on Monday  as he introduced Obama for a speech at the Holocaust Museum  Obama insisted that Assad would fall   eventually  Yet if U S  leadership remains AWOL  Assad s likely to survive and kill for some time yet  Charles Krauthammer   Washington Post Obama has said that we cannot stand idly by  And what has he done  Stand idly by  Yes  we ve imposed economic sanctions  But as with Iran  the economic squeeze has not altered the regime s behavior  Monday s announced travel and financial restrictions on those who use social media to track down dissidents is a pinprick  No Disney World trips for the chiefs of the Iranian and Syrian security agencies  And they might now have to park their money in Dubai instead of New York  That ll stop  em    Obama s  case for passivity is buttressed by the implication that the only alternative to inaction is military intervention   bombing  boots on the ground  But that s false  It s not the only alternative  Why aren t we organizing  training and arming the Syrian rebels in their sanctuaries in Turkey    Nothing unilateral here  Saudi Arabia is already planning to do so  Turkey has turned decisively against Bashar al Assad  And the French are pushing for even more direct intervention  Instead  Obama insists that we can act only with support of the  international community   meaning the U N  Security Council   where Russia and China have a permanent veto  By what logic does the moral legitimacy of U S  action require the blessing of a thug like Vladimir Putin and the butchers of Tiananmen Square  Our slavish  mindless self subordination to  international legitimacy  does nothing but allow Russia   a pretend post Soviet superpower   to extend a protective umbrella over whichever murderous client it chooses   If Obama wants to stay out of Syria  fine  Make the case that it s none of our business  That it s too hard  That we have no security national interests there  In my view  the evidence argues against that  but at least a coherent case for hands off could be made  That would be an honest  straightforward policy  Instead  the president  basking in the sanctity of the Holocaust Museum  proclaims his solemn allegiance to a doctrine of responsibility   even as he stands by and watches Syria burn  Editorial   Washington Post  The  Obama administration  like its  partners  on the Security Council  wishes to be seen as doing something to stop the bloodshed in Syria without having to commit resources or exert leadership  Sadly  this is far from the first such failure  In a blog at Foreign Policy s Web site  Michael Dobbs has been documenting the eerie resemblances between the United Nations  handling of Syria and its history in Bosnia   where an attempt to stop attacks on civilians by dispatching lightly armed peacekeepers in the 1990s led to the worst massacre in postwar European history  As Mr  Dobbs reported  a 1999 report signed by Mr  Annan himself concluded that the Bosnia mission was  at best  a half measure  and a poor substitute for  more decisive and forceful action to prevent the unfolding horror   Said that Annan report   We tried to keep the peace and apply the rules of peacekeeping when there was no peace to keep   It s bad enough that the Obama administration refuses to learn the lessons of previous failures  More galling is its claim that it has made the prevention of atrocities a priority   as Mr  Obama did Monday in announcing the creation of an  atrocities prevention board    We see the Syrian people subjected to unspeakable violence  simply for demanding their universal rights   he said   And we have to do everything we can   Is sending unarmed monitors to besieged cities and shrugging when the people they visit are murdered everything the United States can do  Even in an election year  the answer has to be no  Iran  A Russian proposal would have Iran ending enhanced enrichment of uranium in exchange for cancellation of new economic sanctions  such as the European Union ban on crude oil that goes into effect July 1  Let s hope this isn t the resolution to the next round of talks in Baghdad  May 23 Nor should we hope a report by the Los Angeles Times  Paul Richter on Friday  that the Obama administration may be willing to allow Iran to continue enriching uranium up to a concentration of 5  if the Iranian government agreed to unrestricted inspections and strict oversight  is also not where we re headed   While I like to wait 24 hours after a report like this  if this last one comes to pass  I ll go ballistic  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier in the week that while sanctions are impairing the Iranian economy   so far they haven t rolled back the program or even stopped it by one iota  I hope that changes  but so far  I can tell you the centrifuges are spinning  If the sanctions are going to work  they better work soon   he emphasized Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said on Thursday that despite the strongest ever sanctions against Iran   the chances that  at this pressure level  Iran will respond to international demands to irreversibly stop its program seem low  I would be happy to be proven wrong   Dealing with Iran s determination to achieve a military nuclear capability is not devoid of complexities  dangers or unpredictable results     But dealing with the challenge of a nuclear armed Iran would be  infinitely more complex  infinitely more dangerous  infinitely expensive in human lives and financial resources    Jerusalem Post Israel s military chief  Lt  Gen  Benny Gantz  on the other hand  told the newspaper Haaretz that he did not believe Iran will choose to build a nuclear bomb  a decision that is up to Ayatollah Khamenei  Thus  Gantz doesn t see the urgency for military action  Gantz said Iran s leaders are  very rational people  who are still mulling whether to  go the extra mile  and produce nukes U S  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said   Are they trying to develop a nuclear weapon  No  But they are trying to develop a nuclear capability  and that is what concerns us  Reuel Marc Gerecht writes in The Weekly Standard  Round two  of the talks  could be a success  and lead to a round three  if Khamenei agreed to do five things   1  Stop all uranium enrichment to 20 percent purity  which is near bomb grade   2  ship abroad the entire stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium   3  close the Fordow enrichment facility  which is buried under a mountain near the clerical city of Qom   4  allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency immediate and unfettered access to any suspected nuclear site  and  5  permit the IAEA to install devices on centrifuges for monitoring uranium enrichment levels  Khamenei is  to say the least  unlikely to agree to this  Other Iran related tidbits The Oil Ministry admitted it was the victim of a large scale cyberattack that shut the ministry down  though not the flow of oil  a virus similar in power to Stuxnet  it seems The Iranian government said it had reverse engineered an American spy drone it captured last year  I hardly believe this one Die Welt  a German newspaper  ran a poll and 48  of Germans see Iran as the main threat to world peace A poll sponsored by the Jerusalem Post found that 24  believe the Obama administration is more pro Israel  24  said more pro Palestinian  36  said neutral and 16  did not express an opinion Israel  Prime Minister Netanyahu on Egypt s Sinai Peninsula  The Sinai is turning into a kind of Wild West which terror groups from Hamas  Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda  with the aid of Iran  are using to smuggle arms  to bring in arms  to mount attacks against Israel   he told Israel Radio  We are acting against this reality and we are in continuous discussions with the Egyptian government  which is also troubled by this  Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the situation in Egypt was more worrying than what was happening in Iran  calling for a significant boost in troop strength along the southern borders Egypt s interim military ruler  Field Marshal Tantawi  countered   We will break the legs of anyone trying to attack us or who come near the borders    Reuters Egypt  Regarding the upcoming presidential election  the Wall Street Journal s Matt Bradley reports that support for the Islamist parties is suddenly waning  I m not so sure  and it s not as if the main alternative to an Islamist candidate  Amr Moussa  the former secretary general of the Arab League  is the answer because  recall  he is a hardliner against Israel Yemen  The Obama administration has given the green light to the CIA and U S  military for an increased drone campaign against al Qaeda  which has been building a base in the southern part of the country ever since the turmoil over the central government erupted  The new government is mostly supportive of the U S   but also argues the drone attacks are used by al Qaeda as a recruiting tool North Korea  Most experts seem to agree Pyongyang could conduct its third nuclear weapons test within a week or so  the other tests having been conducted in 2006 and 2009   China s vice foreign minister warned   China will oppose anything which might jeopardize peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia  as this would damage China s national security interests and the interests of the relevant parties as well  But then the vice foreign minister said   We believe that no party should take any action that might escalate tensions   a none too subtle hint Beijing expects the U S  and South Korea to butt out as well   South China Morning Post So while the United States was generally pleased China issued the statement  it being North Korea s only ally  the fact is China always says one thing and does another when it comes to its neighbor This week was one in which the North Korean government interrupted television programming to issue a  special report  wherein it went after South Korea  threatening to  reduce all the rat like groups and the bases for provocations to ashes in three or four minutes   or  in much shorter time  by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style  Well that would be a bit unsettling if you were in the middle of watching a Yankees Red Sox game South Korea reacted angrily   We urge North Korea to immediately stop this practice  We express deep concern that the North s threats and accusations have worsened inter Korean ties and heightened tensions  Seoul also recently announced it has deployed a home grown  long range cruise missile that can hit key facilities in the North  North Korea is said to have deployed 600 Scud missiles and 200 Rodong missiles near the DMZ Meanwhile  the other day when North Korea held its military parade  it showed missiles being ferried on vehicles that bore a striking resemblance to a 16 wheel transporter erector launcher manufactured by Hubei Sanjiang Space Wanshan Special Vehicle Co   a subsidiary of the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp   according to military experts  White House officials say  however  they do not believe the suspected sale to North Korea was sanctioned by the Beijing government Why not  So what if China signed on to United Nations resolutions imposing an arms embargo on the North As for the missiles on said launchers  analysts now say a study of the photos reveals they were fakes  China  As the scandal involving Bo Xilai  former Chongqing party boss and politburo member  and his wife  Gu  suspected of murder in the death of a British businessman  exploded further with the revelation that Bo was tapping the phone lines of President Hu Jintao  some say Premier Wen Jiabao s reform efforts will gain steam  even as he prepares to step down this fall  One Chinese Communist Party member told the Financial Times  The fundamental problem is that there are no real rules in this country  The party makes the laws but then says it and its members are not subject to them  This is unsustainable  Corruption makes the world go  round  but nowhere as much as it does in China Meanwhile  Gu Kailal confessed to police that she was in the room when Neil Heywood was poisoned  according to an account given to American diplomats  Heywood was evidently held down in a hotel room in Chongqing and forced to drink cyanide  He first spat it out and they had to give him more   Irish Independent As to the phone tapping  surveillance is rampant these days in China and the politicos don t know who to trust anymore And now we have the case of blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng  who fled house arrest in his rural Chinese village and is said to be under the protection of U S  officials  I don t have enough details as yet but high level talks between the countries concerning his fate are now underway  just as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top officials are due in China this week for the latest round of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue  Talk about a huge issue for the Obama administration  This comes just as the White House is seeking China s cooperation on a slew of hot spots  including North Korea  Iran and Syria Pakistan  The Supreme Court convicted Prime Minister Gilani on contempt for failing to revive a long standing corruption investigation against President Zardari  though it opted not to sentence Gilani to a maximum six months in prison as allowed  However  he could yet be forced to step down  as opposition leaders now demand  As of this writing  Gilani will defend his right to stay in office  so say his people   The high court itself could come back and disqualify the prime minister Separately  talks between the United States and Pakistan over the November American airstrikes that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on the Afghan border ended in failure on Friday  Pakistan demands a full apology  The U S  was prepared to bite the bullet and issue one but then came the April 15 attacks on Kabul and other Afghan cities directed by the Haqqani network  which has its main base in Pakistan  So for now  Pakistan won t reopen NATO supply routes into Afghanistan that have been closed since the November incident  The Americans  in turn  are withholding at least  1 2 billion in military aid Meanwhile  Pakistan successfully tested an upgraded ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead  days after India conducted its own long range test So we have the Agni V  India s latest  vs  the Shaheen 1A  Pakistan s   India s missile has a far longer range  but it s intended to scare China  while Pakistan s test was designed to intimidate India Afghanistan  The United States committed to defend Afghanistan militarily for 10 years after most foreign forces leave in 2014  though Afghanistan will be able to approve any American military operations after 2014 and the agreement bars the U S  from using its soil to attack Pakistan  or any neighboring country where the Evil Doers have their bases  So I m not so sure this agreement is worth a damn  but we ll cross that bridge when we get to it  Issues such as funding  by the way  were left out for now  as well as the critical issue of permanent bases for the Americans Meanwhile  while the details are to be worked out shortly  it would be nice if President Obama would address the American people at some point on the topic Kosovo  Tensions surrounding neighbor Serbia s parliamentary elections on May 6 have forced NATO to strengthen the mission in Kosovo by about 700 troops amid signs violence could flare up anew between ethnic Albanians and majority Serbs in northern Kosovo Russia  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev virtually completed their job swap when Putin announced he would hand over control of his United Russia party to Medvedev when both trade positions on May 7  But Putin also has his All Russia People s Front  which he set up a year ago  while United Russia s influence has been waning  though it retains a parliamentary majority  So it s like   Here  Dmitry  you take it  Ukraine  Jailed former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko declared a hunger strike on Tuesday after claiming she was assaulted by prison guards  In a statement  Tymoshenko said the guards  came to my bed  threw a sheet over me and started dragging me off the bed  when she refused to leave her cell for a medical checkup So that was Tuesday  Curiously  on Friday  a series of four bomb blasts went off in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk  injuring 27  Ukraine hosts the European soccer championships in June  But some say the  terror attack  was instigated by the government to deflect attention away from the Tymoshenko case And finally France  The first round of voting went pretty much as the final polls said it would  with Socialist Francois Hollande gaining 28 5  to President Nicolas Sarkozy s 27   The surprise was that National Front  FN by the French initials  candidate Marine Le Pen captured 18  in finishing third  a higher percentage for FN than her father  Jean Marie  picked up in 2002 when he gained the run off  only to get slaughtered by Jacques Chirac Sarkozy now desperately needs every one of Marine s supporters if he is to have a chance in the run off against Hollande  who will pick up the bulk of the supporters of the far left s Jean Luc Melenchon  11   and centrist Francois Bayrou  8   But there is zero sign that more than about 50  of the FN vote will go to Sarkozy  with many choosing just to abstain from the ballot out of their disgust for the guy  even if he has adopted many of the FN s political platforms  particularly in terms of an anti immigration stance   Le Pen is also virulently anti euro  not exactly where Sarkozy is  It was one year ago  May Day  that I witnessed Marine  and her father  in Paris for the National Front s traditional speech  but this May Day  Tuesday  Le Pen has said she will tell her supporters how to vote  or not There are many in Europe  like Chancellor Merkel  who are most concerned about the far right s vote in France  I have expressed similar concerns over the years myself  concerning Europe overall  going back to Jorg Haider and his Freedom Party in Austria that picked up so much of the vote in 2000  27    he became a coalition partner in the government But I was early  I always said that Europe s far right would rise in force  but not majority status  mind you  when the economy tanked and of course that day is now  Whether the FN s rise sets the stage for the rest of the continent  though  is highly debatable It would be disingenuous of me at the same time not to say I had done my homework on Le Pen before my trip  but it was pure luck I got to see her  Upon seizing the opportunity to witness history  however  I was indeed taken with Marine s charisma  She s only 43  and could be a player in France for decades to come a legitimate player a 20 percenter  and maybe then some Le Pen said on Sunday evening following the vote   We have exploded the monopoly of the two parties  Whatever might happen in the 15 days to come  the battle for France is only beginning  Nothing will ever be the same again The people of France have invited themselves to the table of the elite  The political junkie in me would love to be in Paris this Tuesday  I also hope security is much tighter than it was last year Meanwhile  wealthy French are preparing to leave in droves  fleeing for better tax situations in Belgium  Britain  and Switzerland  where individual rates may not be much better than France s  under Hollande   but the treatment of capital gains and estates would be One thing is for sure  neither Hollande nor Sarkozy has addressed France s real economic problems Bret Stephens   Wall Street Journal No candidate in the contest has suggested the country ought to attract foreign investment or nurture its native entrepreneurs  No candidate seems to think a tax cut   whether on consumers  producers or wage earners   might be a good idea  Is France capable of nurturing a Steve Jobs or a Mark Zuckerberg  The idea seems to have crossed none of the candidates  minds   Yet Americans should also take note that we aren t so different from France  either  in our debt to GDP ratio  our employment rate  our credit rating  Above all  both in France and in America there s a belief that  as exceptional nations  we are impervious to the forces that make other nations fall  It s the conceit that  sooner or later  brings every great nation crashing to earth   ,2012-05-02,Brian Trumbore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review-part-iii:-foreign-affairs-121939,121939
24738,246253,COHR,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington and Wall Street,opinion,Let s jump right into it with my major predictions for 2011 and see how I did WIR 1 1 2011 I believe stocks will finish down 5 7  in 2011    meaning the three major averages As of 11 25  with five weeks to go  the Dow Jones was down 3 0  and the S P 500 and Nasdaq were down 8 0   Not bad As of 12 16  two weeks to go  the S P 500 was down 3 0   Nasdaq down 8   though the Dow was up 2 5   Still pretty darn good  But not good enough And then we finished 2011 with the following Dow Jones  5 5 S P 500 unchangedNasdaq  1 8 So much happens at yearend  much of which has nothing to do with fundamentals  especially when traders have closed their books and the computers  a k a the casino  take over full bore  But I came close  saving for the Dow  and almost nailed it Point two  WIR 1 1 2011 I believe the European debt crisis is with us well into 2012 and I can guarantee you that Ireland s role is far from over  Can t argue with me here  Ireland  by the way  is going to be a big story again in 2012  Obviously  everyone knows that Europe will continue to call the tune on the global economy  but very few were saying that a year ago   influencing both the U S  and China among the other major engines Heck  back on 6 5 10 in this space  I wrote  So you have a European continent that could be stuck in neutral  at best  for years  nay decades  No reason to change that 1   years later Point three  All first quarter last year  I said the CRB Index of 19 commodities would finish down for 2011  having closed 2010 at 332 80  Even when it was at 360  and then a high of 370  as everyone and their mother was talking about commodities shooting to the moon  I maintained we would finish in negative territory for this key benchmark  citing massive speculation that would eventually be wrung out  It was  The CRB finished the year at 305 30  I m as proud of this call as just about any I ve made For 2012  I see the three major U S  stock indices falling 10   and it is going to be one wild year  controlled by the flash traders and computer program trading  two different things  more so than ever  Stocks could be up big  like 15  to 20   and then crash I draw your attention to something I wrote on 3 5 11  which I m quoting at length because I still believe every word of it  Speaking of the U S  and its deficit dilemma  Congress avoided a government shutdown for two weeks with yet another short term funding deal but this can t go on forever  Eventually it has to face up to its obligations  including a decision on raising the debt ceiling  For all the talk of who is to blame for our current mess  though  there is only one man who stands above the rest in terms of responsibility and that is Barack Obama  He is the one who has to now lead  He is the one who has to give an address or two from the Oval Office and give Americans the facts on our looming entitlement calamity  Obama is the one who has to tell Americans it s time to sacrifice  But the president and his advisers are convinced they can play their game of chicken until after the 2012 election and I m here to tell you that unless the financial markets  including those overseas  believe the United States has come to grips with its deficits  Jan  2013 will be too late  We will meet our Waterloo at some point in 2012  The president had his chance to begin to lay out the facts to the American people with his State of the Union address and instead he virtually cemented his legacy as one of the worst presidents in our history  Obama can still turn things around  but there is little reason to believe he will do so and  no  growth in the economy will not bail us out of a looming debt to GDP ratio of 100  with exploding spending to come in the mighty triad  Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid   the latter two powered by Obamacare in the out years  Until the American people hear the truth  you will continue to get absurd poll  s like we had this week with the latest NBC News Wall Street Journal survey wherein when asked if cuts to Medicare were necessary to  significantly reduce  the deficit  18  said yes  while 54  said no  Warren Buffett was on CNBC this week and said you  can t stop this country   Wrong  Warren  Debt can stop this country  just like debt stopped many an individual and corporation during the financial crisis and has stopped Greece and Ireland  A few months after writing the preceding  I began to talk about a crash in 2012  a 30  decline in a short period of time that will be fueled by our Greece  or Italian like moment  The fiscal numbers between the U S  and those nations may not match up  but something will trigger a severe change in sentiment  which in turn may finally force our policymakers to act  No  the president won t be able to just employ a four corners stall game until November  The markets won t let him Which brings me to foreign affairs and the hot spots  Last year I held back on issuing any bold predictions on this front  outside of the usual concern about Pakistan  Lebanon and China  economics  mostly  regarding the last one  I said of China on 1 1 2011 that I was more uncertain than ever and I still am  I believe the government can engineer a soft landing without massive unrest  but I m not 100  sure of this Here s what I am certain of  2012 is going to be one of the more memorable years of the last 250 years of civilization  At times  President Obama is going to outwardly appear overwhelmed  Even he won t be able to play Joe Cool when confronted with some of the issues he ll be handed One I already told you of  going back months  is going to be largely of his own doing  Iran  I have already spelled out how Obama can lose the election on this single issue if  say  after Labor Day  Iran were to explode even a crude nuclear device  The Republican nominee would have a field day with this   This happened on your watch  Mr  President  So if there is even a 30  chance of Iran having a full nuclear capability in another nine months  given our admittedly shoddy intel   it s too great a risk  Obama has to act sooner and I m convinced it s sometime no later than May  He ll need time to repair the damage  which could be considerable in terms of retaliatory attacks  Hizbullah going full bore on Israel  Syria stepping in you get the picture Iran can t get the bomb  and President Obama knows this  Will Iran give the U S  and its allies an excuse to move through some dumb action of theirs in the Strait of Hormuz  I don t think so  But the mullahs may make a dumb move elsewhere Of course Iran will be gaining increasing influence in Iraq  but you already know that by now  The United States lost the war and we aren t going back  abandoning the country yet again   Imagine being an interpreter who helped U S  soldiers and now having to watch your back the rest of your life  You d have to flee with your family to avoid being taken out in the dead of night  Israel will not only have to deal with probable war with Hizbullah and possibly Syria and or Egypt  but  and I hesitate to write this but I have to  an assassination will occur  courtesy of Israel s own extremist element  a la the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 Egypt s new parliament after the last round of voting will be 65 to 70 percent either Muslim Brotherhood or Salafists  They are supposed to be charged with writing a new constitution  The military will fight back  A presidential election is to be held by yearend but I m doubtful this happens  All I know is this will be a powderkeg virtually all of 2012   Al Qaeda and its offshoots will be a cause of some of the chaos  There will be a military coup in Pakistan  This is a layup  Concerns over the security of its nuclear weapons then will be a huge issue for the world to deal with  At first  India will not act  but Prime Minister Singh will be faced with massive internal problems of his own and any terrorism in India will no doubt be blamed on Pakistan  There will come a time when we ll be watching with fear over a war between the two that could go nuclear within 48 hours Russia will see waves of terrorism in Moscow and elsewhere  Putin and his goons will pull out all the stops to stay in power  including the March presidential election  I don t believe  however  that come Dec  31  2012  it s Putin still standing Europe will be convulsed in riots  as the people in Britain  France and Italy reject their government s austerity programs  For Britain  this will be a real problem with the 2012 London Summer Olympics  Many will be cancelling their plans to attend  France s presidential election in April will be tumultuous  I just don t see how Sarkozy gets in a run off  especially after France loses its AAA rating  as is inevitable  The Socialists will prevail  Marine Le Pen will make things interesting by gaining the run off over Sarko As for North Korea and new leader Kim Jong Un  I m holding off  No one knows  or can really hazard a guess  One just hopes that the leaders of South Korea  Japan and the United States  in particular  have gamed out all the scenarios and are prepared as much as one can be for anything Kim and his Orcs throw at the civilized world China s transition to a new leader  Xi  will go relatively smoothly  but there will be several instances of major unrest as the economy slows further and many homeowners suffer huge losses on their purchases at the top of the bubble  If the unrest gets out of hand  however  China could play the nationalism card and create an issue in the South China Sea  I do not see the U S  and China having more than a war of words   As spelled out below  though  Jan  14 is a key date for the region  Taiwan s presidential election  Here s hoping it is a rare positive for 2012 Christians will continue to suffer  worldwide  as I spell out later And  yes  there will be a serious cyberattack on a major U S  utility or urban infrastructure that will be but a sign of things to come  I m just not prepared to say this is the year we see the financial markets taken down because of one  Through all the above  as if it isn t enough  the eurozone crisis will continue unabated  So let s move on Europe  Washington and Wall StreetIf ever there was a headline that summed up the state of the European continent these days  it was this  Another chunk falls off Colosseum as restoration delay drags on Ah  yes  dithering  The Wall Street Journal had a story  an  in depth  piece on the euro crisis that merely stated the obvious  like what every second grader in America knows by now  There isn t any leadership  anywhere in the world these days  least of all Europe  Angela Merkel of Germany  Nicolas Sarkozy of France  Not by my definition  But the Journal piece talked of what I have the last 20 months  a eurozone that s been dithering  And so here is but a perfect example of the Euro mentality  as told by AFP  The Colosseum lost another piece on Tuesday as Rome s most famous monument deteriorates further ahead of a long delayed restoration funded by an Italian billionaire now scheduled to start in March  The chunk of volcanic tuff fell from one of the iconic arches of the nearly 2 000 year old structure   just two days after a similar incident reported by a group of concerned tourists on Christmas Day put local staff on alert  What idiots  It s a matter of economics  my Italian friends  The Colosseum and the Vatican are your meal tickets  The Vatican knows how to take care of its treasures  So take care of the Colosseum  Get this   The number of visitors to the site has gone from around one million visitors a year to around six million over the past decade   thanks mainly to Ridley Scott s epic film Gladiator starring Russell Crowe  Well  citizens of Italy  If the Colosseum keeps crumbling  a la Pompeii  incidentally  that s six million potential visitors who may choose to go elsewhere and who are you then going to sell your little trinkets to  More importantly  how many hotels and restaurants will go out of business  How many airline employees will lose their jobs as flights are cut back  Do you ever think of this  Italians  Obviously not But at the same time  you stupidly expect us  or your European brethren  or fellow banks  to buy your debt  You have 1 9 trillion euro of it  I ve listed these figures ad nauseum but after an unsuccessful 10 year bond auction this week  more on this in a second   you are coming to market with some 200 billion euro of debt in just the first four months of 2012  At least 440 billion  overall  next year  And you ll be competing with another 1 560 trillion of sovereign and European bank debt being rolled over in  12 So the Italians float a 10 year piece of crappola  the yield goes off at 6 98   and the media calls it a success  I mean all we have been told is that 7 00  is the magic number  Above that and eventually you end up requiring a bailout  a la Greece  Ireland and Portugal  But 6 98  was deemed good because it was less than the previous 7 48   The 10 year ended up finishing the year at 7 01  So you can see why some of us are a bit cynical  knowing the only way the euro crisis gets solved is after a messy crash  Like the horrific chain collision in New Orleans the other day  where on Interstate 10  the taillights you saw in front of you suddenly disappeared  amid either a fog bank or a cloud of smoke  It just went black  Amazingly  last I saw only two were killed but over 60 were injured  That s what Europe is headed for  It will all just turn black  Eventually the curtain will then rise  the ambulances will be able to make it in  the survivors will be whisked away and the dead buried  After a period of mourning  life will resume  Europe needs to bury its dead  I wish they d hurry up and do so  I m tired of writing about this topic  especially when Americans are looking at our own future You want further proof of the sad state of Italy  Remember how about a month ago I wrote of how I couldn t believe more people weren t concerned about the slide in democracy in Europe  How Greece and Italy are now being run by unelected technocrats You know this guy now leading Italy  Mario Monti  You know how some in the media  as well as fellow technocrats  think he s Mr  Wonderful  Following are bits of a report by the Financial Times  Guy Dinmore and Giulia Segreti  Italy has saved itself  from the edge of the precipice   Mario Monti declared yesterday  defending the record of his six week old government while calling on the European Union to deliver a coherent response to the eurozone debt crisis by substantially increasing its bail out fund   Mr  Monti said that under  normal conditions    which he declined to specify   Italy would not need more austerity measures along the lines of the 30 billion euro package approved by parliament last week intended to balance the budget by 2013  The government s next focus  he said  would be a package of measures to regain lost competitiveness by liberalizing the economy  Reforms were needed to the system of labor contracts that virtually guarantees a job for life for some privileged workers while providing little security for others  especially young workers on short term contracts  Mr  Monti said  However  he evaded a question on whether the government intended to challenge trade unions opposed to changing Article 18 of the workers  statute  They oppose making it easier for companies with more than 15 employees to fire workers   Mixing his metaphors  the former professor of economics and EU competition commissioner said Italy had been  on the edge of the precipice without a railing  and had been moving  very close to Greece  in a south easterly direction  Italy had braced itself and was now moving with the winds behind it  to the north west towards Brussels and far from Greece     But the turbulence is absolutely not over   he said  Eegads  I d ask the Italian people   How did you ever elect this guy   But they didn t  That s just one example of what s happening in Europe these days  The treasures  the only reason to go to Europe  I can drink beer anywhere  after all   are crumbling  as are the economies  and you have people running some countries that no one voted for Meanwhile  over in Hungary  you have a maniacal crackpot  Viktor Orban  who is an elected official but turning into a little dictator  The first thing the parliament has done is pass legislation controlling the central bank  Now the likes of Ron Paul would like to do away with central banks  but that s a different matter  Orban thinks that by taking over Hungary s monetary authority and setting interest rates low to spur growth  that then investors will come in and refinance Hungary s massive debt load  Good lord  This is 2011  Not 1342  when people had one eye and the grog was often poisonous  It s a global economy  Viktor  It s not a make believe kingdom So let me try and summarize this week in Europe  The banks are flooding the European Central Bank with their cash  at 0 25  interest  and not reinvesting the huge amounts they just borrowed from the ECB  at 1   into Euro sovereign debt  which is the gamble the ECB was taking  whether they want to say so or not  Ergo  the banks are like Scrooge  in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come  They are petrified  Paralyzed  Unable to lend  Small businesses are dying  I am not the bank I was   they plead in unison   I will not shut out the lessons of Greece  Let s just say that unlike Scrooge  however  the banks aren t close to dancing a jig and buying the biggest goose in the window  There is no happy ending  at least that I see Lastly  Ireland is going to be a big story again in 2012  While Angela Merkel has labeled the Irish the poster child for how to suck it up and move on  the fact is the country  save for some in the export sector  is dead  As some in Ireland are now claiming  though  they must declare default  or at least threaten it  in order to get out from under the massive bank debt the government vowed to honor  Ireland s back in recession  unofficially  and will not be able to meet its stringent targets as established by the ECB  IMF and EC  European Commission   This is where an increased European Financial Stability Facility  EFSF  may have helped  but Merkel refuses to allow this  Ireland needs a break on interest rates  It s time for the placid Irish to rise up  Prime Minister  Taoiseach  Enda Kenney said Ireland also needs more time to pay back the billions borrowed to fix the banks While in Spain  new Prime Minister Rajoy already seems paralyzed  The budget deficit  he s learned  is far worse than he was told  I could have told him that I wrote a year ago that the big problem in Spain was a lack of transparency with banks and the autonomous  regions    He s proposing  billions in cuts  but isn t really spelling out how  just yet  beyond freezing public salaries  The markets  though  are at least giving him a chance to get his sea legs in his new position  But you know what one of Spain s main problems is  Try 700 000 unsold homes  let alone 23  unemployment Turning to Washington and Wall Street  the International Council of Shopping Centers said pre Xmas sales ending Dec  24 were up 4 5   while the National Retail Federation was calling for a 3 8  gain for November and December  I went shopping myself on Tuesday and Wednesday and feel like I got a lot of it done for Christmas 2012   Don t tell my brother it s going to be another lean one  Meanwhile  the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for December came in at a strong 62 5  and better than expected  while the figure on weekly jobless claims was solid But next week we ll get the December employment report  as well as various manufacturing data  including from overseas  and it is likely to be market moving  The following two weeks  earnings will start rolling in As for 2012  the Fed sees an economy growing 2 2 5   while the consensus among economists is in the 2 3 0  range  Fourth quarter GDP is expected to come in at 3  We did see a report on housing from S P Case Shiller for October and prices were 3 4  lower  year over year  in the 20 major metropolitan areas  with Atlanta down the most for 12 months  11 7     Prices in Atlanta  Cleveland  Detroit and Las Vegas are lower today than they were in Jan  2000 But an AP GfK poll says 78  of Americans are hopeful about the year their family will have in 2012  I don t want to be the one to break it to you all  but you are sadly mistaken I mean for starters  there s Washington  It s not going to be good when they return after the holidays  They still have to extend the sham payroll tax holiday for all of 2012  and extend unemployment benefits further as well And then there is the issue of the debt ceiling  which President Obama postponed for the time being  though due to the Aug  2 Budget Control Act  this will not be up for debate again until after Nov  2012  most likely  The thing is  overall  the debate remains the same  How to raise taxes and tackle entitlements  Or  how not to raise taxes and just ignore entitlements As Oklahoma Republican Sen  Tom Coburn said recently   Washington is kind of like Las Vegas  It brings out the worst in everybody  it all comes back to leadership  There is none right now in this country  either Republican or Democrat  Former Senator Alan Simpson  of Simpson Bowles fame  said   This next year is going to be chaos  Absolute chaos   citing Europe  for one Democratic Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota said   the American people still don t believe you need to make hard choices They believe you should balance the budget  but when it comes down to doing the things that need to be done to accomplish that  they don t support them  Until the American people believe we need to change some things  it s unlikely we re going to accomplish them here    Washington Post Boy  that s nice and depressing ,2012-01-02,Brian
