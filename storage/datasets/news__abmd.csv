14333,235848,ABMD,Medical Instruments  Oct 31 Earnings Roster  IDXX  ABMD   More,opinion,Over the last few quarters  the  companies within the broader  sector put up an impressive show owing to some new strategic developments despite certain quarterly volatilities  However  this earnings season so far witnessed a slightly dented growth trend amid the ongoing US China trade tiff and constant regulatory changes  Let us delve deeper Factors Likely to Drive Q3 ResultsThe past few months have been remarkable for the medical device space in terms of R D  Some of the path breaking inventions noticed in the period include implantable CRT Ds and ICDs  wearable medical device technologies and the Internet of Things  IoT   Bio printing  Bluetooth enabled devices  artificial pancreas  human

Asia and Latin America  The company currently eyes a much better performance ahead in China  backed by the rollout of SYNERGY in the region What s Dragging the Q3 Growth Rate Down The US China trade war triggered a short term downtrend in the Medical Instruments sector  Albeit a series of recent exemptions  the last being in September  by the U S  Trade Representative  USTR   the entire community is anxious that this downside might reflect on third quarter results According to a survey conducted by the Medical Imaging   Technology Alliance  MITA   tariffs will cost Medical Instruments companies nearly  138 million every year  This is hampering the entities  third quarter results  For Varian Medical Systems   NYSE VAR    the tariff exclusions in China induced expenses worth  2

learning  based SaMD  software as a medical device   which is currently a focus area in MedTech  The framework incorporating more documentation and oversight is strictly thwarting the FDA approval process by slowing down  the regulatory pathway  Apart from delaying the revenue generation process  this is elevating the R D expenses of the industry players  thereby putting pressure on their

Our Take
Lackluster sales and earnings performance dampened Patterson Companies  fourth quarter results  However  the company s strong fiscal 2019 guidance buoys optimism  We are upbeat about the Animal Health segment that has been performing well lately 
The company provides a wide range of consumable supplies  equipment  software and value added services  A broad spectrum of products cushions the company against economic downturns in the MedTech space  We believe that a diversified product portfolio  strong veterinary business prospects  accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key growth catalysts 
On the flip side  operating margins have been dull   Declining revenues in the dental segment is another headwind  The recent fall in the segment is driven by lower sales of CEREC and digital technology products  Management expects headwinds in the technology based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2019

115705,337220,ABMD,5 Top Ranked Stocks Gearing Up For An Earnings Beat ,opinion,"What drives shares or pulls them down after a company comes up with quarterly earnings  It s not exactly how well a company performed in the recently concluded quarter or exhibited strong growth  it is an earnings beat or a miss which drives the market post release 
This is because investors always intend to position ahead of time and fish for stocks that are likely to come up with an astounding performance  After much deliberation  Wall Street analysts forecast earnings of companies  These estimates act as investment leads 
The Importance of an Earnings Beat
A positive earnings surprise or an earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if it is a decelerating growth momentum  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals are in serious question 
Also  seasonal fluctuations are a vital factor in determining a company s earnings growth  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential decline in earnings in Q1  In such cases  the growth rates are fallacious when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company 
On the other hand  Wall Street analysts club their insights and the company s guidance to derive an earnings estimate  Thus  beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  An impressive track record generally acts as a tailwind  sending the stock higher  It indicates that the company might surpass estimates even in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 10 
Here are five out of 10 stocks 
Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    This is a manufacturer and seller of construction and mining equipment  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 9    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure  CRHF   Coronary   Structural Heart  CSH  and Aortic   Peripheral Vascular divisions  APV   MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations  SI  and the Respiratory  Gastrointestinal   Renal  RGR  divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care  Deep Vein Thrombosis  Compression   and Nutritional Insufficiency  Enteral Feeding  businesses  RTG comprises the Spine  Brain Therapies  Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments  while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management  IIM   Non Intensive Diabetes Therapies  NDT   and Diabetes Service   Solutions  DSS  divisions 
CVG revenues improved 5 4  at constant exchange rate or CER  up 10 1  as reported  to  3 14 billion  driven by strong  low teens growth in CSH  mid single digit growth in APV  and low single digit growth in CRHF  all at CER

CSH revenues were up 12 8  at CER  up 18 7  as reported  to  81 01 billion on the back of low 20s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong global uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform  Moreover  the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business 
APV revenues registered 4 8  growth at CER  up 8 8  as reported  to  497 million  driven by low single digit growth in both Aortic and Peripheral and mid teens growth in endoVenous Medtronic PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Guidance
The company has provided its fiscal 2019 earnings and revenues guidance  For the full year  organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 4 4 5   Currency fluctuation is expected to negatively impact the top line by  50 million   150 million  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  31 05 billion

Our Take
Medtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better than expected fourth quarter performances  The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments  However  escalating costs continue to be a concern 
Moreover  all the major business groups contributed to solid top line growth at CER  which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions  in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets  We are also encouraged by the company s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies  Apart from product innovation  the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses

115754,337269,ABMD,FDA Nod For Abiomed Impella CP With SmartAssist Widens Suite,opinion,"Abiomed  Inc    NASDAQ ABMD   recently announced the receipt of FDA Pre Market Approval  PMA  for its Impella CPheart pump with SmartAssist  featuring an optical sensor  This will broaden the portfolio of its flagship  Impella heart pumps  The company plans a controlled roll out of the technologically advanced heart pump at hospital sites  with developed heart recovery protocols over the next fiscal year 
What is PMA 
Per FDA  special medical devices with a  Class III  tag require a PMA nod for the availability in the markets  Notably  these Class III devices have an extremely high level of risks associated with its usage  Consequently  general regulatory approvals  alone  can t assure the safety and effectiveness of these devices 
Abiomed s Impella CP heart pump is a Class III medical device 
The data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA included over 60 engineering reports and comprehensive technical specifications  Per the company  the clinical data informatics has been verified on 38 patients on the Abiomed Impella Controller at two hospitals in the United States 
Notably  the Impella 2 5 and Impella CP are the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support devices that the FDA has approved as safe and effective for High Risk PCI  Furthermore  Impella CP with SmartAssist also boasts a CE Mark approval and has already been used for treating over 60 patients at three sites 
Impella Product Line  A Major Growth Driver
Abiomed s main product line    Impella    comprises Impella 2 5  Impella 5 0  Impella LD  Impella CP and Impella RP  This flagship product line continued to be growth catalyst  reflecting stellar performance in the last reported quarter as well 
Expanding the Impella portfolio  the company recently announced that Impella 2 5 and Impella CP heart pumps have received PMA from the FDA for expanded use  With this  the products will now be used during elective and urgent high risk percutaneous coronary intervention  PCI  procedures  Notably  it was the second PMA in a row for the devices  which was earlier granted by the FDA to treat heart failures associated with cardiomyopathy  leading to cardiogenic shock 
We encouragingly note that  in the last reported quarter  the installed customer base for Impella CP heart pumps grew by 41 new U S  hospitals  taking the total number of Impella CP sites to 1 134  Thus  the latest FDA approval for the technologically advanced Impella CP will help the company in gaining momentum while accelerating top line contributions from this product 
US Cardiac Disease Trends and the Cardiovascular Market
Per a research conducted by American College of Cardiology  cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 800 000 deaths in the United States  More than 90 million Americans carry a diagnosis of this disease 
According to Research and Markets  the Global Cardiovascular Implants Market is poised to grow at a CAGR of around 4 5  over the next decade 
This promising data indicates what a timely and strategic role the latest FDA approval is going to play in favor of Abiomed

115758,337273,ABMD,Medical Instrument Stocks Head to Head  Abiomed Vs  STERIS,opinion,"Medical Instrument bigshots   Abiomed Inc    NASDAQ ABMD   and STERIS plc   NYSE STE     are pitted against each other in the prospective U S  MedTech space  which is estimated to reach  343 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 4 6   per Lucintel   Notably  these companies benefit from R D innovation  increasing consolidation and the recent tax abatement 
Having similar business models  it often becomes difficult to decide which investment option is better  Further  as things stand now  the scales apparently look evenly balanced as the companies carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Thus  here we take a detailed look at the fundamentals of these companies to determine which stock is currently positioned better in the Medical Instruments space 
Detailed Analysis
With a market cap of  13 3 billion  Abiomed is engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing of medical products  designed to assist or replace the pumping function during heart failures 
STERIS develops  manufactures and markets infection prevention  decontamination  microbial reduction  as well as surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services  The company has a market cap of  8 billion
Meanwhile  you can see  
Price Performance  While the companies have outperformed the industry  up 15 4   in the past year  Abiomed s shares have fared better  In fact  Abiomed s price performance is expected to improve as the latest developments signify probabilities of the company s penetration into the prophylactic high risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market 
Abiomed s shares surged 136 2  in the last 12 months  higher than the 34 5  rally of STERIS 
Consequently  Abiomed wins over STERIS when price performance is to be considered 

 
Earnings Growth Projections  For Abiomed  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is pegged at  2 29 per share  representing year over year growth of 95 7   The stock has long term expected earnings growth rate of 31 5   For STERIS  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  4 13 for fiscal 2018  reflecting a year over year increase of 9 8  
Abiomed wins another round 
Sales Growth Projections  For Abiomed  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at  168 9 million for the next quarter  reflecting 27 6  rise from the prior year  For STERIS  the consensus estimate for sales is projected at  646 7 million for the next quarter  indicating a rise of almost 6 4  year over year 
Abiomed has an edge here as well 
What s Driving Abiomed 
Abiomed s extensive product portfolio and robust demand for its Impella line of products will continue to serve as key growth catalysts over the next several years 
Impella  Abiomed s flagship product line  has consistently been a growth driver  Impella is the world s smallest heart pump  It is a support system of percutaneous  catheter based devices offering hemodynamic support to the heart 
The platform reflects stellar performance in the third quarter  In the United States  the PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records  The company s Impella adoption increased a total of 9  of the 121 000 high risk PCI and 100 000 emergency patients  It was driven by the company s clinical benefits and previous FDA approvals 
Outside the United States  revenues from Impella heart pumps totaled  17 3 million and was up 94  year over year  predominantly from Germany  which recorded  11 4 million  up 71   Additionally  the Company recorded  1 1 million in revenues from Japan 
In third quarter fiscal 2018  the company delivered some breakthroughs in terms of record earnings and revenue growth  Per management  operational excellence and discipline helped the company achieve the highest gross and operating margins to date 
ABIOMED  Inc  Price and Consensus
    
STERIS  A Solid Contender
The bulk of STERIS  revenues are obtained from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries  Growth in these industries is primarily driven by aging global population  as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years 
Further  these industries are dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery  acceptance of new technologies  government policies and general economic conditions  With increasing global life expectancy  a larger aging population increases the demand for medical procedures  This  in turn  translates into higher consumption of single use medical devices and surgical kits processed by STERIS 
Considering the consistent success achieved by the company in offering varied medical equipment to its customers  we believe that STERIS holds huge potential to expand its foothold in these industries 
The current macroeconomic environment across the globe has affected STERIS  financial operations  Governments and insurance companies continue to look for ways to contain the rising cost of healthcare 
This might put pressure on players in the healthcare industry  STERIS being no exception  Increases in prices or lesser availability of raw materials as well as oil and gas might impair STERIS  procurement of necessary materials for product manufacture 
The company competes for pharmaceutical  research and industrial customers against several players that have robust product portfolios and global reach as well as a number of small companies with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries 
STERIS plc Price and Consensus
    
To Conclude
Our comparative analysis indicates that Abiomed is positioned better than STERIS  considering price performance  earnings growth expectations and sales expectations

Revenues
In the reported quarter  revenues increased roughly by 34  on a year over year basis to  154 million  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  148 million  The upside was supported by robust performance of the Impella heart pump product line  The company witnessed three months of impressive Impella performance during the quarter

   Margins

Operating margin is 29 1   which expanded an impressive 690 bps on a year over year basis  The upside is attributable to strong revenue growth  which had partially offset the increase in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenditures

Our Take 
ABIOMED exited the third quarter of fiscal 2018 with better than expected results revenues and margins  During the quarter  the company witnessed breakthroughs in terms of record revenue and earnings growth 
Impella product pipe line continues to be the forerunner  aiding the company gain solid global foothold  Also  the company is progressing in the field of heart recovery  Management is optimistic about capturing the  5 billion U S  market opportunity  We are also impressed with the company s strong margin performance  The company s balance sheet is debt free  which fortifies its financial position at the end of the reported quarter

115822,337337,ABMD,Will A  Huge Tax Cut  Ease Burden For MedTech Players ,opinion,After months of discussions  House Republicans has finally passed the much controversial  1 5 trillion tax reform bill by a vote of 227 to 205 on Nov 16  The members of the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 12 to approve their version of the tax package on Nov 16  This paves the way for the full Senate to hold a debate on the bill once the session resumes post Thanksgiving  However  Republicans are going to make every effort to get the bill signed by President Trump before Christmas Overwhelmed with the House victory  Trump said before a cabinet meeting that   We re going to give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas   hopefully that will be a great  big  beautiful Christmas present  Meanwhile  investors keen on the MedTech space are closely following the developments with the hope that the final tax stature may result in the abolition of the infamous MedTech tax  Before delving deeper into that  let us take a look at the primary objectives of the bills A Brief on the House and Senate BillsAs per an article by Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport  published in The New York Times  the House bill proposes a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20  from 35   It also shrinks the number of tax brackets from seven to four  Alongside  the bill intends to introduce an international tax system for the nation  more consistent with the tax structure of the rest of the world It might also revoke or scale back many well accepted deductions  including one for state and local taxes  The bill also focuses on doubling the standard deduction claimed by most tax payers  At the same time  it roots for the lifting of the child tax credit from  1 000 to  1600  Simultaneously  it calls for complete eradication of the estate tax and allowance of roughly  10 000 in property tax deduction Meanwhile  the Senate Bill raises the child tax credit to  2 000  It also cuts the top marginal tax rate from 39 6  to 38 5   Also  the tax cuts for individuals are supposed to expire by the end of 2025  At the same time  the plan does not propagate a complete repeal of estate taxes  In fact  it calls for the abolishment of the Individual Mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act  ACA  under which majority of the people will be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty Considering the differences in the bills  it is a challenging task for the Republicans to come to a neutral ground and decide on the final structure Tax Reform Bills  Boon or Bane for MedTech According to a Business Insider report  the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses  This will affect families with high healthcare expenditure as these expenses will not be deducted from their taxes  Hence  most people will refrain from opting for expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures   A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20  excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U S  companies  Under the U S  tax code  Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U S  parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island  In this regard  the FDA recently found that around 30  of Puerto Rico s gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016  Undoubtedly  the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover following the approval of the bill While the reduction in corporate taxes will lead to extensive research and development and creation of expensive cutting edge MedTech products  the question over its effectiveness looms large  This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare expenses  the industry is likely to witness a shrink in customer base post enactment  indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices No matter how the policy shapes up  it will prove beneficial to some and challenging to other players in the MedTech space  Meanwhile  it s best for investors to stay on the sidelines until the tax situation stabilizes Bills Mum on Medical Device Tax RepealThe community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2 3  medical device sales tax  This dreaded tax  which was commonly addressed as  fund of the ACA   dealt a heavy blow to the medical device industry since its enactment in 2013  This tax is imposed on the selling price instead of net profit  amounting to a stupendous sum  wiping out almost a quarter of the profit for medical technology companies Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech bigwigs as well as small players  the U S  House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015  Thus  the reimposition of the tax on Jan 1  2018 is much feared by medical device stalwarts A report by FierceMedical Device released at that time revealed that Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   made a payment of  180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014  Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT    Covidien and Smith   Nephew  LON SN  plc   NYSE SNN   shelled out  112 million   60 million and  25 million  respectively  in that year   The situation for smaller companies has been much worse In this context  ABIOMED  Inc  s   NASDAQ ABMD   CEO Michael Minogue quote  in an article by Cheryl Swanson published by The Motley Fool  is quite pertinent  He stated  I don t think taxing the innovators and taxing the group of companies that provide innovation for healthcare is a smart idea  but the biggest concern I have  and what s unprecedented  is to tax companies that are not yet profitable  and in our industry where 70  of the companies are not yet profitable  this is going to have detrimental effects in their job growth  in their survival    Per data provided by the medical device trade group  in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller   the partial two year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in around an 83  rise in research and development  R D  investments by MedTech players  The comeback of the tax will lead to a  15 billion rise in taxes in 2018  largely discouraging R D activities Undoubtedly  the future of the U S  MedTech industry depends on the Republicans  decision on the 2 3  medical device tax Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the

115990,337505,ABMD,Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Tops Q2 Earnings   16 View Up,opinion,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp    NYSE EW   reported second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 76 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 6   Adjusted earnings also improved 33 3  year over year  primarily driven by strong sales growth 
However  unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and increased selling  general and administrative  SG A  along with research and development  R D  expenses partially stemmed this growth  Further  the bottom line results also surpassed Edwards Lifesciences  guidance of 67 73 cents 
Excluding one time items  net income in the second quarter improved 12 3  or 13 7  year over year to  126 6 million or 58 cents per share  respectively 

Sales Details
Edwards Lifesciences  second quarter sales improved 23 1  to  759 3 million  The top line also comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  722 million and the company guidance of  700  740 million  Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve  THV  sales as well as strong performance delivered by the Critical Care segment 
In the second quarter  underlying sales increased 21 1   excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the THV sales return reserve   In the U S   sales improved 32 6  year over year to  401 5 million  In the international market  sales grew 13 9  to  357 8 million 
 EDWARDS LIFESCI Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Sales by Product Groups
In the second quarter  sales from the surgical heart valve therapy product group declined 2 6  year over year to  198 7 million  down 3 3  on an underlying basis   Globally  sales growth was affected as a temporary suspension was imposed on this segment s surgical mitral valves  However  this negative factor was partially offset by solid growth in surgical aortic valves 
The transcatheter heart valves  THV  product group sales grew 48 7  to  418 6 million  up 45 1    primarily on the back of continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies  with notable strength in the U S  THV sales rose 66 7  on an underlying basis in the U S   driven by better than expected procedure growth as well as strong sales growth in both large and small hospitals
Critical Care product group sales improved 8  to  142 million  up 6 7    Global growth in this product group was driven primarily by strong growth witnessed in Edwards Lifesciences  core products and the company s Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program 
Propelled by THV s strong momentum  Edwards Lifesciences now expects sales from THV products in the range of  1 5  1 7 billion for full year 2016  above the company s earlier guidance of  1 4  1 6 billion  reflecting a 30  growth on an underlying basis  However  management continues to anticipate sales in the range of  780  820 million for Surgical Heart Valves and  510  550 million for Critical Care 
Margins
In the second quarter  gross margin contracted by 100 basis points  bps  to 73 3   in line with management s expectation  This decline can be attributed to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  partially offset by a more profitable product mix reflecting strong growth in THV and the prior year sales return reserve 
SG A expenses rose 7  year over year to  228 8 million  on account of sales and personnel related expenses  On the other hand  R D expenditures grew 15 8  year over year to  112 9 million  owing to continued investments in the company s transcatheter mitral valve and aortic valve programs  Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 450 bps to 28 3  as rise in revenues outweighed the rise in operating expense   
Cash Position
Edwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  1 1 billion  compared with  951 8 million at the end of the first quarter 2016  Long term debt was  602 5 million compared with  602 2 million at the end of prior quarter 
Cash flow from operating activities was  190 3 million in the second quarter  Excluding capital spending of  37 1 million  free cash flow was  153 2 million  During the first half 2016  Edwards Lifesciences repurchased 4 6 million shares of its common stock for  415 7 million 
Guidance
Edwards Lifesciences raised its full year 2016 financial guidance  Management now expects total sales to be at the high end of its previous range of  2 70  3 billion  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  2 90 billion lies within the guided range 
Likewise  the company projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  2 78  2 88  up from the earlier guidance of  2 67  2 77   as a result of an upward revision in estimates for sales  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 75 lies below the company guided range 
Earlier  management announced its expectation to deliver 2016 free cash flow in the range of  500  600 million 
For the third quarter 2016  at current foreign exchange rates  adjusted EPS is forecasted within 62 68 cents on revenues of  720  760 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS of 64 cents lies within the EPS guidance range  while the same for revenues of  700 8 million lie below the company s guidance range  
Our Take
Edwards Lifesciences ended the second quarter on an encouraging note  with its financial numbers squarely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  in line with the last quarter    Moreover  the upward revision in both EPS and sales expectations for full year 2016 raises investor optimism in the stock  Incidentally  the upgraded view takes into account strong first half results delivered by the company  an expected third quarter approval of intermediate risk in the U S   and the current momentum of therapy adoption globally 
However  the company continued to perform poorly on its gross margin front  On the other hand  although Edwards  higher operating expenses might have made investors anxious  it is a relief to know that the higher expenses was on account of advanced initiatives adopted by the company to improve its overall sales growth 
Nevertheless  management expects to gain traction in the ever expanding TAVR market  based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidences  leading to strong adoption of its THV therapy

In the reported quarter  Illumina s revenues grew 11  year over year  up 7  at constant exchange rate or CER  to  600 million  surpassing the company s expectation of  590  595 million  Moreover the top line comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  594 million 
Per management  growth in sequencing consumables and strong demand from microarrays were the two factors that primarily drove this top line growth 
 ILLUMINA INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Revenues by Business Categories
Product revenues  85  of total revenue  surged 10 2  year over year to  509 9 million  Within this business  revenues from consumables were up 25  at  379 million on the back of high demand for both Illumina s array and sequencing product lines  Instrument revenue dropped 19  to  126 million primarily due to a challenging comparison in HiSeq instruments  given the launch of the 3000 and 4000 versions in the prior year 
Service and Other  15   revenues climbed 18  year over year to  90 million  The year over year improvement was primarily owing to extended maintenance contracts associated with the largest sequencing installed base and genotyping services  partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue  given the shift in customer preference to in house testing as expected 
Operational Update
Illumina s adjusted gross margin  considering stock based compensation as regular expense  came in at 72 4   reflecting an expansion of 50 basis points  bps  year over year  owing to higher consumables mix that was partially offset by lower services margin 
Adjusted research and development  R D  expenses rose 29 4  year over year  to  124 5million  and adjusted selling  general   administrative  SG A  expenses spiked 19   to  146 4 million   Consequently  adjusted operating margin of 27 2  declined 400 bps from the year ago period  driven by the company s increased investment in head count  GRAIL and Helix 
Financial Update
Illumina exited the second quarter of 2016 with cash and cash equivalents and short term investment of  1 43 billion  up from  1 34 billion of prior quarter  Illumina generated  217 1 million in cash flow from operations in the second quarter  exhibiting a huge improvement from  39 7 million in the previous quarter 
2016 Guidance
For 2016  Illumina continues to expect to deliver revenue growth of 12   On the bottom line front  the company has raised its guidance for adjusted EPS to the range of  3 48  3 58  compared to the previous guidance of  3 35  3 45  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina s 2016 revenues is pegged at  2 47 billion  while that for the bottom line is pegged at  3 37 
For the third quarter  Illumina projects revenues of  625  630 million  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenue is pegged at  629 6 million 
Our Take
Illumina ended the second quarter on an outstanding note  with both the top and bottom line results comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the company s expectation  The company s strong cash balance position buoys further optimism 
Going forward  management expects to witness sequentially higher revenue growth in the upcoming fourth quarter of 2016  Moreover  the raised EPS guidance for 2016 is also encouraging  reflecting chance for the company to deliver higher profits in the remaining quarters of 2016 
On the flip side  the company predicts its business in the EMEA to witness slower pace of recovery which in turn indicates the company s poor performance in Europe to continue  in line with earlier quarter s outcome  Nevertheless we remain impressed with the robust sequencing and array consumable growth  Illumina witnessed in the second quarter
