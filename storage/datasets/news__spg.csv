143368,364883,SPG,Simon Property Group Aims to Save Forever 21,news,"Forever 21  the fast fashion retailer that filed for bankruptcy in September  is dead    but it may rise from the grave 
Brookfield Property Partners  NASDAQ BPY  and Authentic Brands Group  ABG  are joining Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  to form a venture to save Forever 21    bringing the company out of bankruptcy and potentially turning the business around   If we are successful at turning it around  we will make money at F21 and we will make our rent   Simon Property CEO David Simon said on a morning earnings call Tuesday  

Forever 21 is the seventh biggest tenant in malls owned by Simon  which is leading the buyout venture  When Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11  Simon saw an opportunity to place an  81 million  stalking horse bid  to acquire the company s assets   A stalking horse bid is when someone commits to acquire assets of a bankrupt company for a given  usually lowball price  and waits to see if anyone else makes a higher bid  
So far  no competing bids have emerged  and if none do  Simon and its partners will be able to acquire Forever 21 for a song  along with the retailer s operating liabilities  which won t be so sweet  
Why would Simon Property Group want to risk this  If Forever 21 can be revived quickly  its  2 billion a year annual revenue stream should remain mostly intact    and Simon will own  just under  50  of that  according to TheRealDeal  For its part  Simon insists Forever 21 is a good business that can  be turned around  
And Simon knows whereof it speaks 
Three years ago  Simon partnered with ABG to buy Aeropostale out of bankruptcy  At the time  Aero was losing  100 million a year in negative EBITDA  Today  it s profitable again with EBITDA of  80 million

143371,364886,SPG,Simon Property  SPG  Tops Q4 FFO And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Simon Property  SPG  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  2 96 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 95 per share  This compares to FFO of  3 23 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 0 34   A quarter ago  it was expected that this shopping mall real estate investment trust would post FFO of  3 05 per share when it actually produced FFO of  3 05  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times 
Simon Property  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Retail industry  posted revenues of  1 49 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 49   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 46 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Simon Property shares have lost about 10 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for Simon Property 
While Simon Property has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Simon Property was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  2 97 on  1 43 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  12 62 on  5 77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  REIT and Equity Trust   Retail is currently in the bottom 12  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/simon-property-spg-tops-q4-ffo-and-revenue-estimates-200504317,200504317

had a very busy productive quarter too and another successful year for our Company  Our full year 2019 funds from operation per diluted share was  12 04  which includes a  0 33 charge for the early redemption of our four series of senior notes  Adjusting for the debt charge  our full year FFO was  12 37 per share  at the upper end of our initial 2019 guidance  Comparable FFO per share for the year increased 4 4   It is a testament to our relentless focus on operations  cost structure  active portfolio management  commitment to our strategy that we achieved the upper end of our initial range  even with the number of headwinds we faced during the year  including retail bankruptcies  significant downtime due to major redevelopments at many of our properties and a reduced overage from tourism spending  including the negative impact from the continued US strong dollar  as well as the continued trade tensions limiting visitors For the fourth quarter  reported FFO was  1 045 billion  or  2 96 per share  comparable FFO was  3 29 per share  an increase of 2 8  year over year  We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics  including our comp NOI  which grew with our international properties grew at 1 7   Our comp NOI for domestic properties increased 1 4  for the year  Retailer bankruptcies impacted our comp NOI by roughly 120 basis points  and lower overage rent due to reduced international tourism  I mentioned earlier  increased    impacted our comp NOI growth by 30 basis points to 40 basis points We are pleased to report that retail sales momentum again accelerated in the fourth quarter  Reported retail sales per square foot for our malls and premium outlets was  693 per foot compared to  661 in the prior year period  an increase of 4 8   Keep in mind  this is on top of more than 5  increase for the prior year  We continue to believe reported retail sales are understated and are negatively impacted by Internet returns at retailers process at our brick and mortar locations For the recent holiday period  some media reports quoted in store sales growth of less than 1 5   That s contrary to our number  which was more than 3  and again  impacted by the Internet returns that occurred at our stores  These sales results further reinforce the benefits retailers experienced from opening    operating in high traffic  highly productive  well located real estate We generated a record of over  1 billion in gift card sales  which was an increase of more than 18  year over year  Leasing activity remain solid  Average base rent    minimum rent was  54 59  The malls and premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of  7 83  which was an increase of 14 4  Our malls and premium outlet occupancy at the fourth quarter was 95 1   which was an increase of 40 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the quarter    third quarter  down 80 basis points compared to the prior year  which was impacted roughly by 200 basis points from the bankruptcies that we processed through the year  We have successfully released approximately 60  of those bankruptcies already On an NOI weighted basis  our operating metrics were as follows  Retail sales on an NOI weighted basis is  884 per foot compared to  693  Occupancy would be 96   and average base minimum rent would be  73 Now  just to move to new developments  we opened one new development in 2019 in Mexico  Construction continues on five new outlet developments in leading markets  including four international destinations and one in the US  Malaga  Spain  which will open this month  Bangkok  Thailand  West Midlands  England  and in 2021  Normandy  France  and Tulsa  Oklahoma  Very few companies that I know of could open in Thailand and in Tulsa and throw in France for fun We completed a number of redevelopments and expansions across our portfolio in 2019  including four redevelopments of former department store spaces  We had a very busy year on the expansion of several high performing international outlets  adding approximately 400 000 square feet in aggregate to centers in Seoul  Korea  Kent  England  and Vancouver  Canada  We currently have 15 former department store redevelopment projects under construction  Our share of those costs are roughly  850 million  We have 20 more in our pipeline  And at the end of the fourth quarter  redevelopment expansions  densification projects were ongoing at more than 30 properties across all of our platforms in the US and internationally  with our share of that net cost of approximately  1 3 billion  As a reminder  we fund these accretive projects through our internally generated cash flow And just to give you a sense of the magnitude of some of the downtime we are dealing with  with respect to our redevelopment  the projects that we have under construction that will open in 2020 will contribute approximately  70 million of incremental NOI in 2021 as they are stabilized  So again  Thailand  France  Tulsa  30 projects under development   1 3 billion   70 million of NOI that will be generated in 2021  Good comp NOI given a few headwinds  And just to put it in  I know it s a lot of numbers and a lot of going on  but it s important for everybody to understand it Now let s talk about Aeropostale and ABG because  again  we see a lot of misinformation out there  And I just    I think it s important just to give you a sense of our smart capital allocation decisions that continue to differentiate our Company  We completed our third full year of owning Aeropostale  So I would like to take some perspective on that investment  I m going to simplify this  I know it s a lot of information  I m going to simplify this and focus on our cash investment  Our cash investment in Aero OpCo was approximately  25 million  We have already received  13 million of distributions  So I have  12 million of cash invested in Aero OpCo  At the time    at the time we bought it  it was producing a negative EBITDA of  100 million and had over 500 stores Today  we expect Aero OpCo to produce EBITDA pre royalties from 575 stores of approximately  80 million of EBITDA  We believe Aero is approximately  if you put a market multiple on it   350 million today  and our ownership is 50     well  to 50  of  350 million  That s the math Now with respect to ABG  we invested    we made a recent investment in it  So we have a total of 600    sorry   67 million in ABG  Authentic Brands Group  At the time of our original investment  which was roughly  33 million  ABG produced EBITDA of approximately  150 million Today  our value is worth  190 million  Phonetic  of our  67 million  and ABG is expected to produce EBITDA well north of  350 million and the value is growing every day  which leads me to Forever 21  As you ve read recently  we have recently participated with Brookfield and Authentic Brands Group on behalf of the NewCo  SPARC Group F21  LLC and a stalking horse bid for certain assets and liabilities in a going concern transaction under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code Our Group s successful turnaround of Aero after acquainted out of bankruptcy in 2016 gives us confidence with our ability to do the same with Forever 21  Forever 21 is a storied and well    widely recognized brand with over  2 billion in global sales  We believe F21  similar to Aero  presents a very interesting repositioning opportunity  If the transaction is consummated  the NewCo contemplates the continued operations of many of Forever 21 stores and e commerce business and maintaining many jobs  Our interest in the new venture will be approximately 50   The aggregate purchase price    acquisition price is approximately  81 million  plus the assumption of certain ongoing operating liabilities  The process is subject to a go shop period  The auction is expected to be completed in mid February  with closing shortly thereafter Now  we re not done  sorry  We have balance sheet  So  as you know  we were very active  In 2019  we completed three tranche senior notes of  3 5 billion with an average weighted coupon of 2 61   15 9 years  We retired  2 6 billion of senior debt  And our liquidity stands at  7 1 billion  We continued to have the strongest credit profile in the REIT industry Our net debt to NOI is 5 2 times  Our interest coverage is 5 3 times  and our long term issuer ratings of A A2 continues to be the highest in the REIT sector  We paid a record dividend in 2019 of  8 30  a 5 1  increase over 2018  We paid approximately  3 billion in dividends in 2019  And we have paid more than  31 billion in total dividends as a public company  We will be well over  33 billion this year  And today  we announced a dividend of  2 10 per share for the quarter  a year over year increase of 2 4  for the first quarter Now  let me turn to our outlook for 2020  Let me just briefly summarize 2019  We posted another record year of results  Revenues  cash flow  FFO per share  dividends  all records  We continue to strengthen our Company through innovative disciplined investment activities that will allow us to continue to deliver long term cash flow growth  FFO and dividend growth  As a reminder  our 2019 results also included  0 19 per share in income related to insurance settlement at our Opry Mills Moving on to 2020  Our guidance range is  12 25 to  12 40 per share  This range represents approximately 1 7  to 3  compared to our FFO of  12 04  Our range is based on the following assumptions  major redevelopments occurring in many properties resulting in significant downtime  the impact from a continued strong US dollar versus the euro and yen compared to 2019 levels  comparable NOI growth from our combined malls  outlets  mills and international platforms up 1      00 16 18  approximately 1   no planned or acquisition    no planned acquisition or disposition activity  and a diluted share count of 354 million shares To conclude  we had another very busy and successful year  Our Company and portfolio is as well positioned as ever  and that will only improve with our ongoing investments  Given our track record of earnings growth  NOI and cash flow generation and increase in dividends  we continue to be curious to see the yield of our stock 500 basis points higher than the 10 year treasury  This is an ongoing overreaction to the negative sentiment  However  regardless  we remain undaunted  Throughout our history  we have zigged when others have zagged  and those moves have served us well  I m extremely confident of where our business is and about the growth prospects of our Company ahead And we re ready for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America  Your line is now open Craig Schmidt    BofA Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you  I wondered if you could characterize the outlet results  They seemed obviously to have an impact from the lower traffic  but it also seemed like there were a number of store closings that impact the outlet  If you could just tell us where the outlet relays to the mall business David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  the outlet business had a very good year  I mean  the only    I mean  it was affected by certain bankruptcies  but we had significant comp NOI growth  It was higher than the mall business  And the only real shortfall occurred  like I said in the overage rent and that was primarily at our bigger centers due to the strong dollar and tourism  So the outlet business  we are projecting again for our comp NOI to be higher than the mall business  Again  Craig  don t get caught up in this narrative We re seeing really good results for the outlet  We d like a little weaker dollar  more tourism  I believe that s temporary  It s good to see that  Obviously  we ve got a bigger picture going on with coronavirus and tourism  I assume that will be temporary  However  it s great to see the China and the US completed their trade discussions  And assuming we get through this coronavirus scenario  we expect our overage to continue to be dominant or at growth in our outlet business  And we have no worries or concerns at all about our outlet business  Tulsa is leasing  Normandy is leasing  Bangkok is leasing  West Midlands    and even with Brexit  Megxit  whatever you want  it s leasing  Ashford is leasing  You get    Vancouver is leasing  So I hope that gives you a flavor  So don t believe the narrative  You will understand what we re doing Craig Schmidt    BofA Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  And then on the 1  comparable NOI guidance is lower than you achieved in 2019  What would you say are the major drivers of that number David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  look  I would say  primarily because of the downtime  if you    again  we re a big company  So it s a little harder for everybody to understand all of that s going on  But if you see the significant redevelopment that we have  we have downtime  And the reality of that is we think in 2021  that we could sit here and we don t have throwaway years  You know our philosophy  But we do have significant downtime  That NOI that we ve got  that takes a decrease  and these are big malls like a Burlington and Northshore  and all of that stuff A lot of that stuff is coming on in late 2020  We expect  70 million  as I mentioned  just from those redevelopments to come on into 2021  Obviously  we re projecting a stronger dollar  So we are muted on our overage rent calculations with our outlet business  and those are the primary  And then  obviously  we ve got some retailer restructurings that are occurring  Some of that s related to the newer rent in    that s likely to occur with the F21 stabilization  some other restructuring  So you put it all in  and that s 1   I m not overly worried about that number  I d like it to be higher  but we ve got some things to deal with  and we re dealing with it Craig Schmidt    BofA Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  And then just    do you have what the leasing spread was just for the fourth quarter in 2019 and was that result somewhat timing related David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWe don t  We just do it on a rolling 12 Craig Schmidt    BofA Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentThat s a number we post  It is what it is  We don t say too much price over it  Just like sales  I mean  we had this discussion on sales and it was the most important thing  Now I understand it s the least important thing  So again  you kind of know our view  which is that sales are interesting  They re not determinative because again  we can replace retailers that aren t performing  And then  we do think our sales per foot are muted by the returns  Okay Craig Schmidt    BofA Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Thank you David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup  Your line is now open Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystHey  It s Michael Bilerman here with Christy  David  I wanted to go through some of the investments you re making in retailers and other sort of tech platform initiatives  And the numbers you gave out on Aero  I m surprised you didn t quote Adam Sandler  Again  we re not too shabby  right  A 15 times multiple on Aero is highly impressive  When you step back  how do you think about all these investments  whether it was Aero and potentially Forever 21 and then Life Time  Pinstripes  Allied  PARM  Soho House I know some of them may be varied  How do you think about the investment itself versus driving disproportionate leasing within Simon s assets relative to all the other retail landlords  right  So  how much of it is a benefit  not only potentially of turning these retailers around  like you did with Aero versus how much of it s incremental leasing that you re going to get out of your assets or protection of stores relative to everybody else David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  first of all  let me just talk about the retailer investments  We would not have done Aero or we would    and we would not be attempting to do Forever 21 for the sole purpose of maintaining our rent  And that s the biggest misnomer out there when I read various publications and analyst notes and media notes  We do it  We make these investments for the sole purpose of we think there is a return on investment  Now  the fact of the matter  we did all this at Aero and then reality is they kept paying us rent  So that s like    that s obviously beneficial  And I don t want to understate that  but that s not why we do it  At the same time with F21  we do think there is a business there  but it s got to be turned around  And I m not going to project today to you what those numbers are  but we ve got our work ahead of us  But if we are successful in turning it around  we will make money at F21  and we ll get paid our rent  But again  the sole purpose is to make investment in our    for the benefit of our Company Now the rest of them  we are creating a flywheel of unique entrepreneurs that understand the benefits of physical space  understand the benefits of the new consumer today and whether it s Pinstripes or eGaming or the deal that we did with RGG  Rue and Gilt and what s going on with Shop Premium Outlets  and the deal we did with PARM and  Indecipherable  at the SPE  This is a flywheel that no other company in our industry can do  We expected to get the benefit of return on those investments  but additionally  the ability to make us a better operator and also bring those kind of ideas to our portfolio  So  we learn how to be a better operator  we make money on the investment and ultimately  in some cases  they bring their product to our physical portfolio So I can t imagine a better scenario for us  but we re in early days on all of the stuff  but we expect to prosper from these kind of investments  Underlying those  we want them to add value to how we operate as well as to our portfolio and we re doing that  I mean  if you ve seen as an example  I mean go add chapter  verse on the stuff  But if you see what Life Time brings with their new concept to our portfolio  you d say I get it  Would I rather have that than a moderate underinvested department store  And the answer is come on  it s a no brainer Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystRight  Second question I had was  if you think about where your NOI breakdown is today between the malls  outlets  mills and international  which is the pie chart you have on Slide 17 and you sort of married up with the pie chart of where you re spending your capital  which is Slide 28  and then you add in a lot of these other types of investments that you re making  Where does    let s say  three years out or maybe five years out  where does the composition of your income and asset base shift to from effectively non retail uses  resi  hotels  office  the totality of all these sort of investments that you re making and then the traditional retail business  What do you think the split would be David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentI mean  it s really    it s    we benefit  you could argue with either way  but we benefit from    I think we really benefit from being a large company  And it s obvious that we re able to make investments and pay our dividend without having to finance our dividend  etc  So when I look at it  we    even when we look at just our non retail real estate  I mean to get to the NOI of over 5  is going to take a lot of work  but we do like that    we do like the diversity of our geography  our product type mills  outlets  malls  our mall business is under 50  of our NOI today  We love the international business  that s been highly profitable  And I think we ve got a pretty interesting company because it s so diverse and so big  and so well financed  Like I said at the end  I mean  we can zig when others zag or is it zag with zig  I always get confused Brian J  McDade    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerEither way David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentEither way  So  we can zig when others are zagging and we can zag when others are zigging  Maybe that s the answer  And then we have our whole additional portfolio of other investments that maybe one day we have a spin off of that  Maybe one day we re not a REIT  Maybe one day  we re just this diversified interesting company that people will finally think  hey  it s not a bad company  not too shabby Christy McElroy    Citigroup    AnalystHey  David  It s Christy David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWe did have  not too shabby  in this conference  But we took it up  but if we can use   Christy McElroy    Citigroup    AnalystHey  David  It s Christy  If I could just add a follow up on Craig s question on comp NOI  So realizing that you re now including international and I assume that s on a constant currency basis  I m wondering if you could provide sort of an apples to apples comparison with the 1 4  growth in 2019 just for North America  And then just a clarification  your comp NOI growth excludes those larger redevelopment projects  is that correct David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentOnly a few of those  So not all of them  It depends on the size of a    we have a definition of that  We have a size of it  And so  that s not all of them  It just depends on some of that  So it doesn t really    international marginally helped  It s not a big deal  I would suggest to you that the biggest thing affecting our comp  as I said to you earlier  is that we do have a lot of redevelopments that are affecting our cash flow  I don t    and that s    when they come on  it will be  70 million in 2021  There is downtime  I don t think people appreciate that because we are    you re used to dealing with smaller companies frankly  And if they are leasing it out to X  Y  Z  it moves the needle  We re a little bit different  and what we    there is no denying  we ve got some leasing to do  Our occupancy is down a little bit By the way  if you believe the narrative  you think our occupancy year over year will be down 500 basis points  it s down 80 basis points  We ve already leased 60  of it  So I m not    you have    we look at ourselves a little bit different  We give you a year by year number  We don t have throwaway years  Our 1   I think  is going to be fine  And if we get a little uptick in overage rent  it will be better  If we don t  it won t and we ll    life will go on Christy McElroy    Citigroup    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets  Your line is now open Jeremy Metz    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  Good morning  David  just one quick one  Go back on Forever 21  just given that  obviously  there is still a process being run here and there are some different outcomes that could come out of this  Just interested  is your current guide  is it built around all stores staying open and just operating at a reduced occupancy costs  or was that the base that s built in here David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWe don t    again  given our size and given our historical results  we don t get into specific retailer rents or restructurings  That s for other folks  That s not for us Jeremy Metz    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystThat s fair  And then we    as we think about sort of the ebb and flow of closings and bankruptcies we ve seen  2019 obviously a pretty big year  2018 was down from  17 though  So as you look at the landscape today  you look specifically at your outlet and mall portfolio  Obviously  what happened last year and what could be in the pipeline sacked into the 1  comp outlook  But more high level  how do you feel about the landscape here today  given there is still  obviously  plenty of over levered retailers out there David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  I think    look  I think we re projecting it to be lower than last year for sure  But it s our point of view  and there are no certainties  But I would certainly    my best judgment call would certainly be to be dramatically less than last year  Last year was a very difficult year when it came to that if you look at  Historically   17 was a high year   18 was a low year   19 was a high year  So we re anticipating a lower    certainly a lower amount  but that s our best estimate of what we see today Jeremy Metz    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And last one for me  As we look at where the stock is  as you mentioned  the misperceptions out there  the big dividend yield spread to cash you ve been able to generate  How are you thinking about further stock buybacks at this point  just given the redevelopment pipeline and opportunity there that you outlined David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentMaybe we should go private  It s really what we should do  The reality is  look  it s in our    we do have the opportunity to do that  We re obviously waiting to see kind of what transpires in the global world right now  but it s something that we ll obviously continue  We do think our Company is undervalued  And I would expect this to continue to play into that  It s not in our numbers  and we ll see how the next period of time evolves Jeremy Metz    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystThanks for the time David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler  Your line is now open Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentGood morning Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  I ll change up the answer because you called me out on the    out there last time  But I will say to Bilerman s thing  he mentioned that you didn t do not too shabby  I would point out that you brought Megxit  which may be the first in REIT land to mention Megxit David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentThat s why I keep saying  we re a little bit different than the rest of the folks  Okay  Megxit has    by the way  I m thinking of uptick sales in Vancouver though  So there ll be a benefit from Megxit Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Well  if you could be a little less different  if you could go back to the 7 00 AM release time  that would be appreciated David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo problem  We had a technical difficulty  So it wasn t as bad as the Iowa caucus  But it was a little bit of a technical difficulty Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  So two questions  David  I appreciate that you are not going to comment specifically on the individual tenants  but we did notice that Forever 21 dropped out of your Top 10 in the fourth quarter over third quarter  Obviously  NOI in the fourth quarter was a lot weaker than previously  So maybe you can just in aggregate talk about what    to the extent  you can talk about the impact in the fourth quarter and then what your bad debt credit is for 2020 versus what the actual was in 2019  Just to get a sense for how much the 1  is impacted by maybe a change in bad credit versus historical versus other things David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  look  we are    we certainly    it s not surprising to you  And again  I    you are very kind and you are very smart  and that s why you want me to answer these F21 questions  But    and I don t really want to answer  but I will answer this  Our fourth quarter was clearly impacted by the reductions that us and others provided to F21 to help stabilize their business  Okay  And that was    and that is    that new scenario is one of the reasons why they dropped out of our Top 10  So it wasn t like we wanted it to drop out of our Top 10  but that s just the math Two is    and I    again  I have to impress upon everyone out there  We do a    overage rent is an art  not a complete science and it is back end weighted for the fourth quarter in the outlet business  We actually were way behind in overage rent and all the way up  And we made some of it back  but we didn t make what we had originally budgeted  So when you put the two together  that s why we were a little short domestically to get to our 2  original budget  I mean  there is no hiding that  There is no denying that  But that is an art  no science  Now  that s why we ve been extra conservative  I d say on the overage in the outlet business  But there is a lot going on I mean right now  tourism is way down in the United States  I don t control that  Usually  we re a beneficiary of that  but sometimes we run into a headwind  But that has nothing to do with the long term viability of this great real estate and these great properties  And that s what we have to  as investors and as you as analysts and us as operators  all have to kind of overlook these temporary things So we did  So in summary    I hope I answered the question  In summary  our fourth    our Q4 was impacted by what we did with F21  It was impacted  the shortfall in the overage rent with the outlets  We re projecting a similar scenario next year  So hopefully  we will be conservative upon that  but time will tell  And obviously  that does the restructure of F21 because it was a big retailer  It does have it    it does flow through 2020 as well  I hope that answers On the bad debt  it s basically pretty flat from  19  which was a pretty decent size year  So that    but again  there is no longer bad debt  It s just    you don t get the income you thought you d get  Okay  From an accounting point of view  being an old GAAP accountants  I still scratch my head on that  But the reality is it s no longer bad debt  You just don t get all the income you thought you were going to get revenue  contrary Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystAnd then the second question goes to the dividend  You obviously highlighted where your yield is relative to the 10 year  You guys always point out your sort of mid single digit dividend increases over the years  But maybe that mirrors your taxable dividend increase  in which case it will    it won t be lower  But just given  it seems like your comments that the market is not appreciating your dividend and the guidance coming a little short of where the Street is  should we brace ourselves that maybe you don t increase the dividend this year or maybe the increase is nominal  maybe 1   or your view is to continue growing it in the sort of mid single digit even if the market doesn t appreciate it in the stock price David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  look  I think we will continue to grow our dividend  We have earnings growth next year or this year  I should say  2020  We grew 2 4  Q over Q  So that s certainly a signal to you that we are not backing off our dividend growth  I mean  will it be as high as 8  or 10   like it s been over the last five years or six years  It may    probably not  But again  I don t think    I look at it    I guess if you are in my shoes  when I hear the word bracing  I just want to explain to you  we re not bracing here my friend  We re on the offense  We actually feel good about our Company We feel great about our dividend  We feel great about our balance sheet  We feel great about these other investments we re going to make  We re going to hopefully turnaround F21 and make money  So the last thing    the last word you will never see in our    hopefully  I shouldn t say never  but we don t    we re not bracing here  Okay  Yes  we have some leasing to do  given the high amount of bankruptcies  We ve already leased 60   Yes  I d like to see tourism come in  Strong dollar does limit spend  I mean  you will see that from other retailers  the retailers that are    that have an important exposure to tourism  We have all that redevelopment in 2020 that s ongoing  that takes properties down I mean  at a mall  at Northgate that did  18 million of NOI  it does zero    zero today  I mean zero  And we accelerated it and we have development rights that could make that property worth  1 billion  Again  we don t have throwaway years  Alex  as you know  And so  yeah  this year will be not as    not as robust growth as maybe some of the years in the past  That doesn t mean we re bracing  no bracing here  not in our vocabulary Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Okay  Thank you  Thank you  David David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  David  Good morning David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentGood morning Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystJust one quick clarification  I think what you said was F21 is still in the pool  It s just a lower tenant and therefore  should we assume F21 as a tenant  is included in the  20 FFO guide David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentOh  yeah  yeah  It s just    we and others adjusted the rent for the fourth quarter  And because of the base rent  it s just    it s number 11 or 12  What is it Brian J  McDade    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerNumber 12 David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   President12  They are 12  Forever 21 is in our Top 12  Okay Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  I promise you that s the last question  I m going to ask about Forever 21 David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo problem  We have no problem with any questions anybody wants to ask Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystSure  And so  actually just staying along this line of your investments in retailers and I appreciate why they ve been really attractive investments for you  So two questions  First of all  are these held in the TRS  I think they are  And then number two  do you have a sense for how high you could go with your retail investments before you got up your non REIT limit in the TRS Brian J  McDade    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerYeah  they are in our TRS  And there is a lot going on  technically  about this that the NAREIT is working on  And I ll just defer that because it s a little arcane  But we ve got plenty of room    and given that it s in our TRS  we ve got plenty of room that we are not going to    there is no issue about maintaining REIT status  a bad income or gross asset test and all this    all of it  all of the various REIT tests that you have to meet  So we ve got plenty of room to run Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYeah  And I was really saying that not from  are you hitting the limit  but it seems like this is an attractive investment pool that might warrant some further consideration in the future David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  look  I think we    look  I guess  Rich  what I d say to you  we are grounded in real estate  but we have over time found that we can do other things reasonably well and that is our goal to do that  We ve had success    we haven t been perfect  And if we are    if we do end up buying with Brookfield and Authentic Brands Group  Forever 21  I mean  obviously  that s going to be a lot of work  That is a big restructure ahead of us and that will    we will want to make sure that that s done right  and there are no guarantees on that So don t expect another retailer that will pop up until we get that stabilized  But at the same time  we re always looking at additional investments  I mean  we re very excited about the long term prospects that we have with our    basically  our merger with RGG  And we are just starting that whole process  and that s a whole another avenue for this Company in terms of e commerce and tenant relationships and retailer loyalty  and all the other stuff that comes with that  And we re just    that we literally just closed in November  So    and we merged our operations into those  and they are just starting to improve our Shop Premium marketplace  So I mean  there is a lot of growth ahead of that as well  And then you ve got all of the mixed use stuff that we re doing  whether it s Northgate  whether it s Phipps  you go down the list  I mean  there is a lot going on  and that s why we feel good about where we re positioned Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  And just two final things for me on Forever 21  I know    I told you I wouldn t ask about it again  but I can t help myself  Your 50  investment  should we think about that 50  on top of your 25  investment and top of your 50  investment in ABG  would that 50  include the look through on ABG David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo  no  It s just    it s actually a little under 50  to be technical  It s approximately 50   No  that s a separate stand alone entity  It has nothing to do with our investment  And we    our    we only own around a little over 6  of ABG  Okay Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Got it  And then  you didn t buy back any shares this quarter  despite what the stock price has done  Is that just a simple capital allocation decision given your discussions you are having on F21 David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo  I just think we got busy and no real good reason  Obviously    unfortunately  we made the right choice not to buy it back  right  But I just think we were busy in the fourth quarter and everything else Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Touche  Thanks  guys  I appreciate it David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentThanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank  Your line is now open Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystThanks  Just going back to the guidance  can we get what the total NOI growth embedded is  And as well  are there any one time charges that are dragging down the FFO number David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo  not that    nothing material  no Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystAnd what about the total NOI growth number David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWe    this is what we gave  It s consistent with our past practice Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  I guess I m just wondering if there is anything else that s    if the number is going to be similar to your comp NOI number like it s been David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  I mean  look  I think  on some of these that are in our non comp pool  we have    we have this downtime that I ve alluded to  I mean I    we can quantify it for you  but we all kind of put it in the blender  And that s where our guidance is  I mean  we had significant    put it this way  we expect in 2021 to generate around  70 million of additional NOI and most of that is still dealing with our downtime  then we ve got expansions that are opening up worldwide  which usually come in    the strategy there is a little bit different  Lease up is not 95   tends to be a little bit lower So we just have one of these years that because of all the activity  you are not    it s not manifesting itself in the growth  but we don t have a throwaway  yet we re still going to grow our earnings  We re still going to grow our dividend  We re still going to have the best balance sheet  We are still going to make these fund investments  We are still going to keep moving the portfolio  And it s just    I mean  the people do have a year that doesn t necessarily had terrific growth because we re making all these investments  It s    you see it elsewhere  We were a static company  I get it  but we re not  We re really busy  Does that help Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystYeah  And then  David  it is helpful to get that  70 million benefit to NOI in 2021 from the redevelopments coming online later this year  I guess  what we don t know is what this ongoing drag from redevelopment could be  Meaning that  is that going to be purely a benefit in 2021  or are there still some of this redevelopment downtime to deal with And I guess  I m wondering  at some point  would you think about maybe providing some sort of NOI bridge  I mean it s something the office REITs have done to deal with lumpiness and tenant move outs and tenants being refilled  And I think it would be pretty helpful to understand what that    how that plays out to get to the growth of the Company over the next couple of years David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  I mean it s possible  We don t    we    like people just have seen what we re doing and then the results of it manifests itself  But this is an active year of investment and redevelopment  and the growth will have some impact to do that  We ve also had a history of outperforming our guidance  And I mean  let s face it  we re being conservative  There is a lot of noise around the world from an economic and obviously  it s an election year  We ve got this terrible situation on the virus  and we don t know what that means  So  there is a lot going on  But I ll go back to    I think Alex had phrased  I mean  we re investing in the future and we feel really good about kind of all the stuff that we re doing and it will manifest itself in 2021 and beyond  But like Phipps    I mean  Phipps is a great example  I mean the malls torn up and that stuff is going to come on late  21  So that s not even in that number So    but your point is valid  We ve never wanted to do that because we ve never wanted to have people think we re having a throwaway year  but this will be somewhat of a year of investment  And that happens with    I mean it s happened with them  nothing compares to Amazon  but it s happened with the big companies that say  yeah  they are investment  I mean  So that s what we re doing  We ll see where it shakes out  Not unusual Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystAll right  Thanks  David David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with J P  Morgan  Your line is now open Michael Mueller    J P  Morgan    AnalystYeah  Hi  Just a quick one  Were the rent spread trends in the fourth quarter outside of Forever 21 stable  Would you characterizing this David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  We had a very    we had a    like I said  we underperformed in our overage all year with the outlet business  and they had a really good fourth quarter  It just didn t    if you understand how overage works  you ve got to get over the break point and you ve got to do it  So we caught up on that  We actually were underperforming all the way through the fourth quarter  They had a very good fourth quarter  We didn t see any real retailer changes too much  and I think sales were pretty good and we leased up space  We didn t think we would get to 95  We got a little over 95 once  So  I think we had a pretty good fourth quarter  all things considered  I mean  again  I don t do your models  but I look at    I know my business pretty well  And the reality is that I think we had a pretty good fourth quarter Michael Mueller    J P  Morgan    AnalystGot it  And then  I think you mentioned you could quantify the redevelopment drag on that 1  same store outlook  Can you do that David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  We will do that at some point Michael Mueller    J P  Morgan    AnalystGot it  Okay  That was it  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies  Your line is now open Linda Tsai    Jefferies   Co     AnalystHi  Could you share with us some very broad steps you took to get Aero EBITDA positive and how these processes might translate to getting Forever 21 in a similar place  I mean in your opinion  is retail distress somewhat formulaic and what s holding back retailers from fixing themselves David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  every retailer has its own particular sort of issues  I think Forever 21  really the biggest issue that it had historically was that it took its eye off the ball  primarily because of the international growth  And then it created another brand that took its eye off the ball and then  obviously  the store size got too big  So  we are really good at sourcing and that s where Authentic Brands Group is fantastic at sourcing product  We think  in Forever 21 s case  it was fast fashion and the time that we got for delivery of goods would shock you in terms of how long it took  So  we kind of took the fast fashion out of fashion and obviously  Forever 21    or I m sorry  ABG s graded branding I mean if you look at    we re an investor in Sports Illustrated  They bought the Sports Illustrated IP  If you have seen kind of how they ve already created all the buzz around Sports Illustrated  it s a great example of what they do  You look at how they branded Shaquille O Neal as an example  That s what they do  So  they bring all that marketing and the brand awareness expertise to bear  We did the same thing with Aero  So each year    you have to diagnose the problem  There is a lot to restructure at F21  On the other hand  it is a brand that does close to  2 billion of volume  even with the    all that s going on So  I mean that was what we looked at Aero  When Aero    when we took it over  900 million  we are talking about  50 million business  So that gives us    it gives us a comfort and it s sourcing  marketing  it s better efficient  more organizations  better technology  And it s just common sense being better operator and between the    our and it s also being an owner that can withstand just    withstand stock  right  So  you don t panic  And you just    you keep your head down and you keep plowing  We did that with Aero  We told Aero we don t care about comp NOI  comp sales  What we care about is building the business for the future  focus on EBITDA margins  focus on gross margins  focus on increasing the quality of the product and we don t care about comp sales Now  it s a little bit like our business  There is a too much of a focus on quarter to quarter comp NOI growth  We get it  We focus on it because we love cash flow  But at the same time  we ve got to make investments for the future that will accelerate that comp  There is no difference  The only difference is that we don t panic and others do  And that s why we re here calm about it Linda Tsai    Jefferies   Co     AnalystDo you think the timeframe for getting Forever 21 EBITDA positive will be similar to that of Aero David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentI would say that    it s a good question  And I would say it s a little more complicated in a little bigger business  And it depends on whether one or two of my guys are going to spend all this time in Los Angeles  So  I m negotiating it right now  Linda  Stay tuned Linda Tsai    Jefferies   Co     AnalystThen just one other follow up  Given this environment of closures  how are you thinking about the credit worthiness of the new tenants you re signing on  What sort of process do you go through to get comfort around their brand relevance and stability and liquidity David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  historically  we ve been very focused on that  We re very    we are very    look  that s not to say we don t take flyers here and there  But we re probably    if you asked around  we re probably as thoughtful on that as anybody in our industry  And it s very important to us  especially if we make any kind of tenant improvements  We re very focused on payback and credit worthiness  We don t bet a thousand there  but we are    it s extremely important to us Linda Tsai    Jefferies   Co     AnalystThanks David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI  Your line is now open David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentHello  Okay  Let s go to next OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Haendel St  Juste with Mizuho  Your line is now open Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystHey  Good morning  Thanks for taking my questions  So first one is on redevelopment  Looking ahead to 2021  and what appears to be a positive inflection in your earnings growth  helped by the expansion of the redevelopment last year  up to  I think was  1 8 billion  well above the one point  the lower ones if you via graph couple of years  And hopefully  some of that incremental NOI growth can help change that narrative around the stock So  I guess my question is on the sizing of the pipeline beyond this year  Your intention to keep the redevelopment pipeline size around where it is  It was  1 8 billion where it s been over the past year  Are you more inclined on reducing that back to the level that you ve run over the past few years in the low  1 billion and maybe preserving more cash flow for other uses and potentially unanticipated other tenant events or even opportunistic investments David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  again  a good question  I would say to you  just wonder because of our diversity in product type  geography  etc   every incremental investment can and will stand on its own  So  we don t feel compelled to save an asset because we re worried about the    hitting our numbers or anything else  So  we re making all of these investments with an eye toward incremental return And we do expect  as we said  historically  yeah  we re going to be busy because we re going to get the ability to get a lot of great real estate back hopefully at reasonable prices that we can add accretive returns to  So  I don t view it as a zero sum game  And I also don t think that it s    that we don t have the firepower to make additional investments outside of our  what I d say  our core businesses  So    but the important thing is I don t feel compelled to say  oh  this small  if I don t do this  I got to do a low return deal  Just to say that  I mean the reality is  if it ain t worth  then we don t invest  And it s not going to    it s not going to    it s not going to really cause too much of a debt from it So    and we are looking at other investments that are outside of kind of the traditional bricks and mortar and I think we ll continue to do that  But we ll also continue to make investments in brick and mortar because there s    nothing has changed about it  It s a good business  It s just    yeah  it s    we are running through a cycle here that s not as robust as what it s been in the past  But you ve got to remember  we ve been doing this for a long time and we ve weathered the different storms Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystGot it  Got it  Thank you for that  Second question is on the 2020 guide  For another income  is there anything contemplated in the guidance for other income  Anything that could materially move that FFO guide this year one way or the other  And G A  it looks like it was down  10 million last year  What s embedded in the guide for G A this year  Thank you David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure  G A is similar to what fourth quarter is  So right guidance  yeah  And I    we don t have anything real extraordinary in other income in 2021 that s quite unusual  As you know  we had the big settlement from the insurance company of Opry in 2019 in the first quarter  So that will    our first quarter compare to first quarter of Q1 2020  will look different than Q1 of 2019 because that s when we got the settlement from Opry Mills  It only took us seven years  eight years  Okay  That s another story Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystAll right  Thank you David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo worries OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust  Your line is now open Ki Bin Kim    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThanks a lot  Good morning out there  When I look at your lease expirations for 2020  it doesn t seem like you made much headway  It s just one quarter from    going from 3Q to 4Q  But it went down 30 basis points  When I look at last year  you made much more headwind or headway closer toward 100 basis points  Like I said  I know it s just one quarter  but I was just curious if there s anything to read into that or are you kind of just making decision a little bit later David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo  it s just process and there is absolutely nothing to read into that  It s all process  no issue Ki Bin Kim    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystOkay  And just going back to Forever 21  You talked about the flywheel and I think we all get it  But that s why it was also very different for a Simon owned store versus if it was owned by a different landlord  So  how do you balance those things David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWe    look  I think the only history we really have on that is Aero  And I think if you ask the other landlord  they said  we were great partners  So no issue there  Interesting question  But we really    I mean  every store at Aero basically stood on its own  We were not really involved in it  That was all delegated to the team  the operating team at Aero  So  we did not get involved in that  I think at F21  to the extent that we get it  we ll adopt a similar thing  And we  in fact  at Aero    at Forever 21 because of the need to move probably a little quicker than at Aero and the case is moving a little bit quicker  We ll probably hire a third party just to go do it Ki Bin Kim    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors  Your line is now open Vince Tibone    Green Street Advisors    AnalystGood morning  You mentioned earlier you have 15 former department store redevelopment projects under way with the total expected spend about  850 million  so that equates to about  55 million per box  I m just thinking about longer term capex need  is  55 million per department store box a fair assumption David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentNo  And you can t get out of it  That math you really can t do  And I think that it s not    Vince  I would say to you  it s not necessarily capex  It s incremental opportunity  So    and I ve said this before  But just to put it in perspective  if we don t own the department store and that department store owns 10 acres  then we just now have 10 new acres that we    that we can develop  It s not like  when we take capex  people think new roof  new tile  new this  new that  It s incremental opportunity because we don t necessarily control that space  And even if we were on a long term lease  to the extent that we ve got that lease  we now control their space  So it s new incremental space that we did in other words Vince Tibone    Green Street Advisors    AnalystRight  But I m just trying to get a sense of    so that includes probably a lot of other non retail uses  So  what would be a fair run rate of just trying to think about longer term if we re expecting more department stores to close  I mean just from a    maybe not from a capex burden perspective  but just how much capital you re going to have to spend every year to keep    to unlock these opportunities  That s what I m trying to get at more than anything David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  look  I think what you should do  we can give you order of magnitude  I mean  I can do a check in personnel  but I might bore you  You can call up    you can call up Tom  And yes  what would be in order of magnitude  Like  take an example of Phipps  Phipps is  300 plus million  Okay  Midland Park  Texas was  5 million  So it s all over the place  But if you want    the best thing for you to do  Vince  to get a handle on it is that  Northgate  we could spend  600 million   700 million at Northgate  So certain boxes are  10 million Just take a box over  release it  that kind of thing  So really  really is real estate specific  But maybe you go through our 8 K and Tom could give you order of magnitude  But Phipps is a great example  It s a former department store that was on lease  where we let them terminate the lease for payment and then we re spending literally  300 million in    little over  300 million to build a hotel  office and Life Time and additional retail  all in that same spot  And so that can skew numbers pretty significantly Vince Tibone    Green Street Advisors    AnalystNo  that makes sense  That s really helpful David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure Vince Tibone    Green Street Advisors    AnalystCan you just discuss quickly how the overage rent thresholds are reset each year  Just trying to get a sense of like the lower percentage rents paid in 2019  creates an easier comp for  20 or that s not the case  They kind of increase by a fixed amount each year David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentIt usually kind of balances out  So  there s not a lot of volatility  Other than the outlet business  a number of our bigger retailers  they are basically on percentage rent with a very low base  So that s the one that tends to have a little more volatility  In the mall business  we tend to mark the real estate  If they re in overage  we tend to get that as it renews and then others come in  So it s relatively traffic consistent  So  you have overage and then they go    their leases expire You go to basically overage  plus the base rent to get to the total rent and then whole another slew of retailers will go into overage  The outlets tend to be a little longer leases  a little lower base  And therefore  they don t have as much turn  So therefore  the overage rent tends to be a little more volatile in terms of what the math ends up in Vince Tibone    Green Street Advisors    AnalystGreat  Thank you David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  No worries OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup  Your line is now open Christy McElroy    Citigroup    AnalystHey  Thanks for the follow up  Just a follow up on Forever 21  Sorry  Just in terms of the approach to making these retailers profitable again and sort of solidifying the business  there is a going concern  You answered Linda s question  But how does your approach differ and is perhaps much healthier for retailing longer term than the traditional private equity approach to retailer turnarounds  And in addition to store closures and the efficiency and technology  and marketing and operations that you discussed  do you look to convert rents to sort of percentage sales for a period of time to get landlords more in partnership with these retailers David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentI would say  it depends on the scenario  I think if 21  to stabilize it  we might have to do that for a period of time  At Aero  we    they did a lot of the work on the landlords free during the bankruptcy process  Aero was a little quicker  So  we don t have a lot of time to do  They did initial things  So it depends on    in fact really depends on the scenario  And it s certainly a tool that s available to us  And there s ways to handle it  I think the landlord will support us to the extent that we re successful in the auction Christy McElroy    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  And then just a follow up on Vince s capex question to you  You had about  192 million of TIs share in 2019  close to  1 billion of redevelopment and development spend  How should we think about that capital outlay in 2020  as we look at use of free cash flow  especially as you know  the turnover is elevated and could push up TIs  and with everything that you have in the value creation pipeline coming on later this year and into 2021 David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentYeah  I mean  look  I think the TIs went up by  20 million  So to me  that s not going to really change  We re doing more restaurants  a little more entertainment  so you see  The other thing that really spikes that number was we did  A number of kind of a best of brands luxury retailers and I don t want to name names  But they tend to have great build out  It s great for the properties  but kind of the over luxury folks  their investment in there stores tends to be a little bit higher  So  I think you get    we did some great work last year on that  So  we re seeing a little bit of a spike  but the TI is not really much of an issue and the development  Again  I don t know what else to tell you other than that we are going to have these opportunities from department stores  We think they are  net net  it s going to be beneficial to our company and to the existing real estate And you know the role that we play in the community is unbelievable  So  give you an example  between sales tax and real estate taxes at a place like Roosevelt Field  we pay  135 million and the warehouse down the street pays basically nothing  We did a study that said warehouse and distributions pay less than one tenth of what we pay in real estate taxes  So  that s what s interesting  We re making these places better for the community  better for the taxpayers  We have a    we re doing    believe it or not  we re doing sales activity that other aren t in terms of what    as you know  we do believe strongly and we refute others that suggest otherwise  But we do think we provide a greener atmosphere for commerce and there s just so much we re doing that  that it s maybe not necessarily appreciated  But we know what we re doing for these communities  We know what we re doing for the taxes for sales and real estate taxes  And we re also making our real estate better and that s fine  We ll take that responsibility on Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystHey  David  It s Michael Bilerman speaking  Earlier in the call  you talked about buying real estate  that bricks and mortar obviously still has a great future  And that s    you re not going to deviate from that  And when buying makes sense  you would do it  sort of paraphrasing a comment you made  There was a headline that came across on Bloomberg during the call that you potentially had a merger talk to Tom and that eventually broke off given the market volatility  Can you comment on that  please David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWhat would you    you know we don t comment  But we don t comment on those market rumors  I haven t seen it  We ve been busy on this call  So  I m not sure what you re referring to but we ll check it out Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Yeah  It s always just helpful to sort of get the views on whether something could happen or not  And I know the stock buyback wasn t happening during the fourth quarter  So  I assumed whether there were something else going on that would have done that Brian J  McDade    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerNo  we  obviously made the right trade  The stock went down  So  we can buy it cheaper now Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystThank you David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI  Your line is now open Steve Sakwa    Evercore ISI Group    AnalystThanks  Sorry about the earlier technical difficulties  I guess  David  just to maybe piggyback or ask Michael s question a little differently  Just in terms of like acquisition opportunities  Obviously  there is really a lack of capital that s devoted to the mall space today  Everybody is kind of fleet on the institutional side  Are there opportunities that you see to potentially deploy capital outside of your existing portfolio David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentWell  I would say you  generally  yes  I mean  we ve intended    we would tend to  I mean  I think they re worldwide  I mean retail real estate is way out of favor worldwide  not just in the US  And as you know  we ve built our company to do this  We don t have to do that  We ve got lots of    if anything on this call  I know it s dragged on here  it s like a college football game  But we    I feel really good about where we re at  So  we don t have to    on the other hand  as I said earlier  we zig when others zag or we zag when others zig  And sometimes  we usually land on our feet  not always  But we    our industry is way out of favor worldwide  that s interesting to note  But we know what these properties generally mean to the community and to the consumer and to the retailer  Bricks and mortar are important  This real estate is greatly located  So    and then we have kind of all the other stuff that we re doing in conjunction with our core business and it s a unique time for us to think what we want to do in the future Steve Sakwa    Evercore ISI Group    AnalystOkay  And then  not to beat the dead horse on the earnings guidance in the lost income  But I do think it would be helpful to the extent that you have intentionally take properties offline  similar to what you did in Northgate last year  I think it would just be helpful to kind of know what that drag is within your guidance number this year  Is it a couple of pennies  Is it a nickel  Is it a dime  I think  just kind of frame out kind of why    when you look apples to apples at the midpoint  guidance is down a little bit Brian J  McDade    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerYeah  Look  I think that s a good point  We try to do that  maybe not as artfully as we should have  but we try to do it by showing to you that we re going to have a  70 million pick up next year when the stuff comes online  But I guess  what we didn t do is give you a sense of the decrease that we have this year  But I d just tell you that Northgate certainly    it s a good example  There was a property doing 15  16  17  18 in that range and it s basically going to be zero for the next future  That won t pick up in 2021 because it s a long term project but will be great in the future  And it is also base  Phonetic   So  we ve got a property here that we could add to uses incrementally depending on demand  So it s not like  we did over our fees  the best of both worlds Steve Sakwa    Evercore ISI Group    AnalystOkay  That s it for me  Thanks David Simon    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer   PresidentThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with J P  Morgan  Your line is now open

143379,364894,SPG,Can Simon Property Group Save Forever 21 ,news,"Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  is one of the largest mall landlords in the world  As such  it is well aware of the  retail apocalypse  threatening real estate investment trusts  REIT  and leading to retailers closing stores or  worse  completely shut down  That said  financially strong Simon is in a good position to can get creative when it comes to dealing with troubled lessees 
Right now  it is teaming up with Brookfield Property Partners  NASDAQ BPY  and privately held Authentic Brands Group in an attempt to buy apparel retailer Forever 21 out of bankruptcy for  81 million  Here s why that s a good idea  some proof that Simon and its partners know what they are doing  and some speculation on what might come next    
Why Forever 21 matters to Simon
Forever 21 is a fast fashion retailer that focuses on quickly bringing out affordable new styles on a regular basis  It is a staple of most malls  For example  Simon has exposure to Forever 21 stores in 98 of its total portfolio of around 200 enclosed malls and factory outlet centers  The troubled retailer accounted for roughly 1 4  of Simon s rent roll in the third quarter  Losing Forever 21 would hardly be a death knell for Simon  but there s more to the story    

Forever 21 s stores tend to be rather large  The 98 stores in Simon s portfolio account for about 1 5 million square feet of space  For comparison  Foot Locker has 224 stores in Simon properties  accounting for 1 million square feet of space and 1 2  of rents in the third quarter  Signet Jewelers has 364 properties  accounting for 527 000 square feet of space and 1 4  of rents in the third quarter   
Based on third quarter rents  Forever 21 was tied for sixth largest retailer in Simon s portfolio with Signet  But if you look at square footage  it jumps to the third largest  And it does that with less than a quarter of the store count of the two companies that rank above it  Rent concessions pushed Forever 21 out of the top 10 tenant list in the fourth quarter  it fell to No  12  meaning the sales date wasn t disclosed in the earnings release   But that doesn t change the fact that the retailer s stores are relatively large    
For Simon  or any mall landlord  losing Forever 21 means being left with a particularly large hole to fill  That s not good at a time when mall focused retailers  in general  are struggling  Although the retail apocalypse is likely being overhyped  consumers are definitely shifting their buying habits  Malls need to adjust to this new reality  but that will take time  Every store closure and bankruptcy makes it that much more difficult to change along with consumers  Forever 21 is complicated because the size of its stores could mean a vacancy that requires two or more smaller additions to fill  Thus  Simon and partner Brookfield need to weigh the risk of investing in Forever 21 versus the risk of having large empty storefronts in their malls at a time of intense change  Based on the bid for Forever 21  keeping their malls filled is the winning decision here 
Not the first time at the rodeo
What s interesting is that Simon has teamed up with Brookfield  actually General Growth Properties at the time  which was eventually bought by Brookfield Property Partners  and Authentic Brands to do something like this before  This trio bought teen retailer Aeropostale in late 2016  helping ensure its survival to this day  Simon pitched in  25 million for that acquisition  CEO David Simon noted during Simon Property Group s third quarter 2019 conference call that he believes that stake today is worth around  175 million    
That s a big win  noting that the real estate investment trust also got to keep a store in its malls  But perhaps more telling is that Aeropostale was producing negative EBITDA of around  100 million at the time of purchase  Today  after Simon and its partners stepped in  it is expected to produce positive EBITDA of around  80 million  In other words  they fixed Aeropostale  And they did it at a time when retailers  in general  were facing material headwinds    
Thus  it makes complete sense for this trio to try their hand at saving a troubled retailer again  though some rightly question the tactic  For example  Brookfield Property Partners bought General Growth in 2018  just two years after the Aeropostale deal  because General Growth ended up in financial trouble  Simon and partners might have been better off using their cash to pare debt as opposed to buying a piece of Aeropostale  That said  Simon has one of the strongest balance sheets in the mall REIT space and has around  7 billion of liquidity  So the  81 million that Simon  Brookfield  and Authentic Brands are offering for Forever 21 is just a drop in the bucket to Simon  It shouldn t have any trouble footing its share  even if it loses all of its investment

In fact  even in a complete loss situation  Simon could still win  That s because it will continue to have a tenant filling its malls  making them more desirable for consumers and other tenants  for as long as it takes to figure out if Forever 21 can be saved  The worst case scenario is that Simon is buying itself time to adjust its portfolio while it still gets at least some financial benefit from the space Forever 21 occupies  The best case  of course  is that Authentic Brands  which will run the store  manages to fix Forever 21  Simon states that this is the only aim and that keeping a tenant around for longer is just a happy side benefit  That may be true  but it s hard to believe that the occupancy issue wasn t a part of the decision process    
What a fix looks like is clearly still up in the air  since the offer still needs to be approved by the courts  But one thing CEO Simon was clear about in the fourth quarter call was that he doesn t think Forever 21 is broken  He believes that management simply got too aggressive  For example  the retailer s overseas expansion was likely misguided  so expect closures abroad  The size of Forever 21 stores is also a potential issue  getting the retailer back on track could also mean shrinking the size of the average store  So Simon might still have to deal with empty space  but not nearly as much as if Forever 21 simply closed up shop

Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets which are anticipated to contribute to the company s cash flow and revenues in the upcoming quarters Nonetheless  the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore  might limit any robust growth in its near term profit margins  Additionally  shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of

143393,364908,SPG,Is It Wise To Hold Kimco Realty Stock In Your Portfolio Now ,opinion,The latest numbers from the Labor Department indicate a robust job market with increase in non farm payrolls  fall in unemployment rate and increase in average hourly earnings in November  Moreover  consumer confidence remains high and spending continues to be resilient  which are likely to support a stellar holiday sales season  This optimism is evident from the eMarketer  as well  which guide a 3 8  year over year jump in U S  holiday retail sales to  1 008 trillion this year  again marking the first ever trillion dollar holiday season Kimco Realty Corp    NYSE KIM   is making every effort to unlock the embedded value of its portfolio through development and re development initiatives  The company s tenant roster also includes several well capitalized retailers that have fared relatively well The company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high quality assets  concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers  As part of such efforts  in first quarter 2019  the company expanded its presence in two high growth markets in Arizona and California  with a  31 2 million sale leaseback transaction with Albertsons Companies  for three grocery anchored parcels in the existing Kimco shopping centers  In fact  amid transformation in the retail landscape  Kimco remains well poised to navigate through the retail apocalypse mall traffic blues  with focus on service and experiential tenants  and omni channel players Moreover  the company is aiming to expand its small shops  portfolio  These shops basically comprise service based industries  such as restaurants  salons and spas  personal fitness and medical practices  These shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant  Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics  this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks Further  Kimco is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure  and enhance the company s growth profile and tax efficiency as well  The company maintains a strong liquidity profile  with more than  2 billion of immediate liquidity  Additionally  weighted average debt maturity profile now stands at 10 8 years  Moreover  the company aims at growing its unencumbered asset pool Kimco s third quarter 2019 results also reflected increase in portfolio occupancy reaching an all time high level  healthy leasing spreads on new lease and positive same property net operating income  NOI  growth  Particularly  the company registered new leasing spreads of 27 2   This marked the 23rd straight quarter in which spreads on new leases improved in double digits Amid these  shares of Kimco have gained 44 5   so far this year  outperforming the  s 15 2  rally  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year funds from operations  FFO  per share has been revised marginally upward to  1 47 over the past month  Currently  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Nonetheless  in connection to its strategic efforts  the company is making significant disposition of its assets  In fact  dispositions for the nine month period ended Sep 30  2019 included 20 properties and three land parcels  aggregating 3 million square feet of space  for a combined gross price of  392 8 million and Kimco s allocable share of total dispositions  net of acquisitions was  200 8 million  For the full year  the company forecasts  200  300 million in net dispositions  with a blended cap rate of 7 25 7 75   While such efforts are encouraging for the long term  the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term Furthermore  though healthy consumer confidence and a resilient economy have infused optimism into the retail market  mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers  shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  In fact  with e commerce gaining market share from brick and mortar stores  retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures  while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies  Such an environment has also led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions which mall landlords find unjustified  These have cast a pall on retail REITs  including Simon Property Group Inc    NYSE SPG    Macerich Company   NYSE MAC    Taubman Centers   NYSE TCO

143400,364915,SPG,Simon Property Group Is Defying Brick and Mortar Slump,news,"Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   a real estate investment trust  REIT  that holds mostly malls in its portfolio  has seen its share price fall about 35  since it hit a high in August 2016   
Many investors are punishing the company for the challenging retail environment that has seen business at malls decline as people shop more online  Simon Property Group certainly has not been immune to high profile store closings from the likes of Sears Holdings  Charlotte Russe  and Forever 21 over the last couple of years  but the key question is whether Simon Property Group can withstand the changes battering brick and mortar stores  Thus far it has dealt with the environment very nicely 

Financial gains despite vacancies
With ownership interest in 204 U S  based properties and 29 locations outside of the country  along with a nearly 22  stake in a Paris based real estate company  Simon Property Group s results are inextricably linked to domestic malls 
The U S  properties are mostly traditional malls  106   but it also owns 69  premium outlets  and 14 The Mills locations  traditional malls  outlet centers  big box retailers  and entertainment centers that are in major metropolitan areas  
Despite the challenges confronting brick and mortar stores  Simon Property Group posted a small year over year jump in revenue in its most recent quarterly report
The REIT generates the overwhelming majority of its revenue from leases  For the first three quarters of 2019  this revenue made up over 90  of its top line  This lease revenue consists of the fixed rent it charges tenants and the portion of the tenants  sales that it gets  

Data source  Simon Property Group  YOY   year over year 
At its core U S  properties  the company s occupancy rate slipped a bit when comparing the state of things at the end of the most recent quarter with a year previous  However  Simon Property Group was able to raise rents and garner more revenue through its tenants  higher sales  It was a similar story at The Mills  properties  The company s properties are in some prime locations  which is a major plus  After all  if the company s malls were in wastelands  it would not have been able to hike rents and its tenants would not have generated higher sales 
This all helped Simon s third quarter lease revenue rise by almost 2  versus third quarter 2018  from  1 28 billion to  1 31 billion  Funds from operations  FFO  per share  a key REIT metric that is used to measure cash flow  was flat at  3 05  but management noted that this came about despite unanticipated bankruptcies and redevelopment of properties  among other factors   
CEO David Simon said on the third quarter earnings call that   Our results of the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of  1 081 billion  or  3 05 per share  We achieved     this     even with certain unanticipated retailer bankruptcies  and  reduced property level NOI  net operating income  from the acceleration of properties undergoing significant redevelopment     He also noted that a strong U S  dollar hurt FFO since it resulted in lower spending by tourists  
While retailer bankruptcies are never a good thing for the company  redeveloping properties is a positive step  showing the company is adapting to the changing retail landscape  For instance  Simon worked with Life Time to redevelop its Southdale  Minnesota  property  America s oldest mall  into a  live work play  facility that has fitness centers  co working spaces  spas  and cafes    


Meanwhile  J C  Penney and Macy s are undergoing some operational challenges  and these account for about 6  and 12  of Simon Property s U S  square footage  Macy s recently announced that it would close 29 stores  28 Macy s and one Bloomingdale s   about 4  of the 680 that operate under those banners  Right now  it is not clear how these closures  or any future ones  would affect Simon and other anchor stores are doing just fine  such as Nordstrom and Dick s Sporting Goods  

Management is not sitting still  either  The company continues to redevelop properties  including in South Korea  Vancouver  British Columbia  and Washington State  It is continuing to push to change properties into multiuse destinations  This includes deals that were announced in October  including with Life Time  lifestyle brand   Pinstripes  entertainment   and Allied Esports  e games    It is also pushing new property developments internationally in Spain  Thailand  England  and France  
Some numbers
Simon Property Group had  26 6 billion in debt and  3 6 billion in cash as of Sept  30  2019  Its net debt to net operating income ratio was 5 1 as of the third quarter  down from 5 5 in 2017  A lower figure means a strengthening balance sheet    

Since this is a REIT  Simon Property Group must distribute at least 90  of its taxable income to shareholders  With strong cash flow  the company has consistently raised dividend payments  Most recently  it boosted its quarterly payout in August  by  0 10 to  2 10 a share  With a 5 7  dividend yield  this equity is very suitable for income seeking investors ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgrbk,2057404

143406,364921,SPG,Better Buy  Realty Income vs  Simon Property Group,news,"Realty Income  NYSE O  and Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  are both bellwether names for their respective real estate niches  and they both focus on the retail sector  But they are vastly different companies  Here s a look at just how different they are  and why one appears to be a better bargain than the other today 
1  The core of the business
Realty Income is one of the largest publicly traded net lease real estate investment trusts  REITs   That means that it owns properties  about 85  of its rent is from retail assets   but its lessees are responsible for most of the costs of maintaining those assets  It s a fairly low risk business model in which a company sells a key property to Realty Income and then instantly rents it back under a long term lease  The company is usually looking to free up capital to fund growth projects or reduce debt  So Realty Income is something of a funding source  Realty Income makes the difference between its cost of capital and the rents it charges  and locks that profit in with a long term lease  It s a win win relationship 

Simon is 100  tied to the retail sector because it owns enclosed malls and factory outlet centers  Like Realty Income  it is one of the largest players in the sector in which it operates  Malls  however  require a lot more management than a net lease asset  Simon has to curate the list of lessees at each mall  which can amount to hundreds of relationships per property  to ensure that consumers will be interested in shopping at the malls it owns  That s on top of making sure that a tenant is financially strong enough to pay its rent  Not only does the REIT need to make sure it has the right list of stores in its malls  but it also needs to ensure that the rest of the mall is top notch  too  That includes everything from parking to the cleanliness of the bathrooms  It s pretty much the opposite end of the spectrum from net lease effort wise 
2  Great locations 
Realty Income owns around 6 000 properties  With a portfolio that large  some buildings are obviously going to be better than others  In fact  Realty Income s scale is pretty impressive  so it takes sizable deals to move the needle on the top and bottom lines  For example  in 2019 it bought roughly 450 properties in a single  1 25 billion acquisition  Every one wasn t a winner  but in order to see the impact it had to take the good with the bad 
That brings up an interesting point about net lease assets  Growth comes largely via portfolio expansion  contractual rent increases are nice  but generally track along with inflation   So Realty is constantly on the lookout for properties  That said  it is usually working to prune less desirable assets from its massive portfolio as well  because  as noted  with such a large portfolio you are bound to pick up a few duds along the way  
Simon s portfolio is roughly 200 properties  Because of the scale of a mall  and the fact that being in wealthy and well populated regions is vital  it can t just add assets willy nilly    each property must be capable of standing on its own  On that score  Simon has built an enviable portfolio of well located assets  Its growth comes from improvements it makes to the properties it owns  allowing for rent increases and property expansion  and new malls  which it often builds from the ground up  Today it has a few factory outlet centers under construction in foreign markets  but it s spending most of its time upgrading the malls it currently owns  The key difference here  though  is that Simon needs to focus a lot more than Realty Income on the location and quality of its existing assets  Buying and selling properties is much less frequent  
3  The sky isn t falling
Realty Income s portfolio has held up very well  its occupancy is over 98   despite the increasing pain being felt in the retail sector as consumers shift toward online shopping  Many of its properties are necessity  pharmacies and gas stations   experiential  movies and restaurants   and service related  fitness   Thus it has been somewhat protected from the over hyped retail apocalypse 
Simon  while also holding up quite well  has felt the brunt of investor concerns here  That makes sense given that much of the pain being experienced in the retail sector is hitting the types of retailers that occupy the malls it owns  notably fashion retailers and department stores   
However  with Simon s occupancy levels up near 95   its well located assets appear to be navigating the changes taking shape relatively well  In fact  the retail apocalypse is more likely to be a shift in which stores consumers want to see in a mall rather than the end of the mall itself  Sure  weak malls will go under  but even online stores are opening physical retail outlets in desirable locations  Simon s well located malls are an obvious draw  even if the transition from old line tenants to new ones might take some time  Simon will have to keep spending to keep its malls fresh and appealing  it has roughly  7 billion in liquidity to help get that done   but there s little evidence yet that the mall concept is actually dead  
4  Polar opposite perceptions on Wall Street
At the end of the day  Realty Income and Simon are both large and well run REITs  They are leaders in their respective niches 
However  Wall Street has very different views of the two companies today  seeing one as largely resistant to the retail apocalypse and the other overly exposed  

SPG data by YCharts
Thus  Realty Income s stock is trading near all time highs  Its 3 6  yield  meanwhile  is near an all time low  To be fair  this is actually good news for the REIT  since one way it raises capital is by selling stock  As such  its cost of capital is very low right now  allowing it to more easily ink new deals  However  new investors should proceed with caution  Realty Income s price to funds from operations  FFO  is around 23 times today  this is like price to earnings for an industrial stock   That s what you d expect from a growth stock  not a dividend stock known for slow and steady dividend growth  Put simply  Realty Income looks expensive  In fairness  it s a great company  so a premium valuation makes sense  But today s price appears extreme  

SPG Dividend Yield data by YCharts
Simon  on the other hand  has lagged well behind the REIT universe  Its 5 7  yield is the highest it has been since the 2007 to 2009 recession  It s also well above the yield offered by Realty Income and the average REIT  as measured by Vanguard Real Estate ETF  The company s price to FFO ratio is around 12 times right now  Compared to Realty Income  it is clearly on the  for sale  rack  sorry  that pun was too easy   For an REIT that owns great properties and runs them very well  even in the face of adversity  that seems like an opportunity for value conscious investors  
Which is better 
Clearly  Simon Property Group looks like a better buy today  It is dealing with a headline grabbing headwind  but it is doing well despite the gale  Meanwhile  investors seem to have taken the view that all mall REITs should be avoided  even well run ones like Simon  For investors that can stomach some uncertainty  Simon Property Group is the easy winner here 
But don t take that to mean that Realty Income is a bad REIT  It s not    it s just an expensive one right now  In fact  most investors would do well to put it on their wish list  just in case there s a notable pullback  At the right price  it would be a wonderful addition to a dividend focused portfolio ",2020-01-20,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkd91,2063209

143436,364951,SPG,Who is making money from struggling U S  malls ,news,"By Richa Naidu and Carl O Donnell CHICAGO NEW YORK  Reuters    With its lonely hallways  half shut food court and out of order restrooms  the River Oaks Center mall in suburban Chicago seems like an unlikely place to make money  But that is exactly what two little known  family owned investment firms   Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management   are doing here and across the country  With about 100 malls from New York to Utah now under their ownership  the two funds have climbed quietly from anonymity to being among the country s top twenty mall landlords   thanks in large part to an aggressive low investment business strategy at many of the distressed malls they have acquired over the past five years  The approach has been aided by a slew of retail bankruptcies  and the fast changing consumer tastes in favor of e commerce firms such as Amazon com Inc  O AMZN   offering these two investment firms brick and mortar assets at bargain prices    For a graphic  click   About half the malls Namdar and Mason have acquired are similar to River Oaks  properties with relatively low sales  sometimes in need of redevelopment and typically located in underdeveloped neighborhoods  More recently  the rest of their mall mix has consisted of healthier  but not high end  properties as the funds have been trying to improve the quality of their assets  A source with direct knowledge of Mason and Namdar s strategy said the funds invest as little as possible on many of their properties  adding the aim is to hold the assets  not redevelop them  The approach is not without its detractors  namely mall tenants and some government officials who were hoping to see more investment in their malls once Namdar and Mason took control of the property  But in locations like River Oaks  that investment has not come    There has definitely been a decline in traffic   said Vickie Bass  manager of the Ashley Stewart clothing store at the mall   In interviews with Reuters  Namdar and Mason said the upkeep was adequate and that they do not flip malls  preferring to hold onto them  On occasion  they have sold their least profitable properties to redevelopers   When you own 100 retail properties  of course you re going to have people having complaints    if there are issues  we deal with them   Namdar President Igal Namdar said   We have a very high retention rate for our tenants  which shows us we are doing a good job    The low rent Namdar and Mason ask for   sometimes only a couple of thousand dollars a month   has helped keep down vacancies at their malls  according to store managers and sources familiar with Mason and Namdar s strategy  In order to improve the caliber of their tenants and portfolio  Namdar and Mason told Reuters that they have increasingly been buying healthier malls    We now want better quality assets  malls that are occupied  with healthy ratios and diverse tenants   Igal Namdar said   BUYING CHEAP  Igal Namdar  48  and his wife s cousin  Elliot Nassim  36  the respective founders of Namdar and Mason  said they developed their investment strategy after they started buying malls together in 2012  Namdar  who got his start in real estate using money from his family s jewelry business  said he clinched his first mall deal that year with Nassim by acquiring Desoto Square  NYSE SQ  Mall for  24 6 million from Simon Property Group Inc  N SPG   after it defaulted on a  62 million loan  A key aspect of Namdar and Mason s strategy is snapping up malls at very low prices  Namdar and Mason told Reuters they have spent an average of  15 million to  20 million to acquire retail properties in the past three years  a fraction of what many of the malls cost to develop  According to real estate data firm Trepp  Namdar and Mason bought 22 properties that were being sold in bankruptcy auctions between the start of 2015 and the end of 2017  paying an average of  5 3 million for each mall  This reflects a 92 percent discount to the value of the malls when they secured their loans  according to Reuters calculations  Namdar and Mason typically spend 20 to 50 cents per square foot on maintenance  This compares to an average of about 60 cents per square foot that U S  mall owners spent on mall upkeep in the first quarter of 2018 among malls that reported square feet for the period  according to National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries  Namdar and Mason have spent so little on the malls they have acquired  they often yield a 10 to 16 percent capitalization rate  a gauge of the investment s rate of return  according to real estate services firm Cushman   Wakefield s head of capital markets Mark Gilbert   This tops last year s average U S  mall capitalization rate of 5 4 percent  and even the 9 percent rate mall owners enjoyed on average in their 1990s heyday  according to real estate research firm GreenStreet  But Mason

143437,364952,SPG,Putnam stares down hedge funds on big shopping mall bet,news,By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON  Reuters    Putnam Investments has placed a large  concentrated bet that struggling U S  shopping malls can transform themselves even as key tenants shut stores or file for bankruptcy  So far  it is winning   to the chagrin of hedge funds like Alder Hill Management LP that are on the other side of the bet  Putnam  a Boston based mutual fund firm  holds more than  1 billion worth of derivatives tied to mortgages on shopping malls  office buildings and hotels  according to interviews and filings analyzed by Reuters  One way Putnam gains exposure to the mortgages is through the CMBX Series 6 Index  which references a basket of 25 BBB  rated commercial mortgage backed securities  There are about 46 shopping malls linked to the index  whose key tenants   Sears Holdings Corp and J C Penney Company Inc   have been closing stores at a rapid clip  Putnam has been selling protection on the CMBX  which means it is betting that the mortgages referenced in the index will not go bad  Investors buying protection  including Alder Hill  are betting there will be loan defaults and writedowns on the same properties  Putnam funds receive payments from investors shorting the CMBX index but are on the hook to pay those investors if borrowers do not make adequate mortgage payments or if there is a loan writedown  The CMBX Series 6 index is generating returns of 6 percent  Brett Kozlowski  a portfolio manager on Putnam s fixed income team  said in an interview  The trade does not involve any leverage  he said   That performance has helped the  4 7 billion Putnam Diversified Income Fund rise nearly 5 percent over the past 12 months  beating 90 percent of peers  according to Morningstar Inc research  That fund discloses nearly  700 million in exposure to the CMBX Series 6  Other Putnam managed funds have similar investments on a smaller scale  Although Putnam has been winning  its investment strategy is not without risk  Retailers have struggled for years with consumers  changing tendencies and how to compete against online shopping behemoth Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   Nearly 9 000 major chain stores closed in 2017  according to real estate firm Cushman   Wakefield  That was more than double the number of closures in 2016  outpacing the record set in 2008 during the Great Recession  Cushman   Wakefield said  The carnage has continued this year  with the Bon Ton department store chain filing for bankruptcy and closing more than 260 stores  Its woes mirror rivals like Sears  which has closed more than 250 stores and continues to bleed cash  Although Putnam realizes the retail sector is still having trouble  its investment strategy is partly based on the idea that shopping malls can transform themselves into different destinations  Kozlowski said  For instance  the Westside Pavilion outside of Los Angeles is converting square footage into office space  The short sellers see a much grimmer future  The CMBX Series 6 index would plunge 56 percent in a worst case scenario outlined by Alder Hill in a July report  Even with limited store closures  the riskiest malls in the index will only be able to produce 45 percent of their 2017 operating profit going forward  the report said  The New York based hedge fund declined to comment  The Emerald Square  NYSE SQ  Mall in North Attleboro  Massachusetts  is one example cited in its report  Alder Hill estimates the mall s value is less than outstanding debt of  104 million  hurting its chances for redevelopment like at Westside Pavilion   Emerald Square Mall is likely headed for a term default and a high severity loss for CMBS lenders   Alder Hill said  Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  LP  which owns 56 percent of Emerald Square  was not available for comment ,2018-09-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/putnam-stares-down-hedge-funds-on-big-shopping-mall-bet-1619684,1619684

This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 0 34   A quarter ago  it was expected that this shopping mall real estate investment trust would post FFO of  3 02 per share when it actually produced FFO of  3 04  delivering a surprise of 0 66

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Simon Property shares have lost about 4 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for Simon Property 
While Simon Property has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Simon Property was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

REITs are the perfect  pullback proof  plays   for two critical reasons  which we ll dive into now  Along the way  I ll reveal two attractive  China proof  REIT picks  plus two laggard REITs that could be collateral damage in the trade war 
The Fact  REITs Beat Back Downturns
Most folks don t know this  but REITs don t fall as far as stocks in a correction  and they bounce back faster  Look at this latest pullback  the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ  barely missed a beat  while the S P 500 flamed out

The Laggards  Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  and STAG Industrial  STAG 
This is a great time to discuss the two REIT laggards you need to dump now  because our first one is VNQ s No  5 holding  mall owner Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  whose brick and mortar tenants will have to raise prices when China tariffs rise on September 1  That comes as Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   
Simon s mall occupancy  by the way  continued to tick lower in the second quarter  to 94 4  from 95 1  in the first and 95 9  in the fourth 
And by the way  the REIT s 5 3  yield is a mirage it only exists because the stock cratered 30  in the last year 
A Classic Sucker s Yield




Another REIT  STAG Industrial  STAG   might also take you in with its 4 9  monthly payout 
But I m worried about STAG Industrial  NYSE STAG   which devotes a lot of space to the slowing car business and trade sensitive areas like logistics  containers and machinery

The Winner  National Storage Affiliates  NSA 
Self storage is a great business all you have to do is hand out the keys to the lockers and dust and sweep the place every once in a while  Self storage REITs are also oblivious to trade and benefit from long term trends  like baby boomers downsizing 
Enter NSA  the smallest player in the space  with 729 properties across the US and a market cap of just  1 8 billion 
But going small pays in this sector  because few folks realize NSA has one of the highest yields in the business  at 3 9   plus the fastest dividend growth 
As I wrote in     a rising dividend is the key driver of share prices  NSA is the poster child  with a surging payout that s paced the stock ahead of all other self storage REITs  Check out how NSA s stock rises with each individual dividend hike  The pattern is unmistakable 
A Growing Dividend Is Your Best Pullback  Insurance 




It follows  then  that NSA should continue rising so long as its dividend keep popping higher  That s a lock  funds from operations  FFO  the REIT equivalent of earnings per share  surged 12  in Q2  and the payout is a manageable  for a REIT  at 80  of FFO 
Now let s move on to our second reason why REITs are critical to fending off a pullback and setting yourself up for market beating longer term gains 
The Fact  Collapsing Rates Will Ignite REITs

It s a clever way to grab headlines  but Michele is on to something  with the Fed in easing mode  the long bond s yield has cratered from over 2 1  to below 1 8  since Trump s August 1 tweet

DLR  like most data center REITs  carries significant long term debt on its balance sheet  about  10 8 billion worth  so it would certainly benefit from lower rates

Check out DLR s dividend growth 
DLR s Payout Triples




Thanks to that surging payout  folks who bought back in 2009 can forget about a 3 5  yield  they re hauling in a massive 9 9  on their initial buy today 
With the payout eating up just 62  of FFO in the past year  this  digital landlord   which counts reliable tech players like International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  and  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  as clients  is virtually certain to drop more hikes our way 
To get a sense of what that might look like a decade from now  let s conservatively say the payout grows half as fast in the next 10 years as it did in the last 10  That would be enough to give you a 7 3  yield on your original cost 
And yes  as with NSA  DLR s payout has paced its share price higher  As you can see below  every time the stock price and dividend have diverged in the past decade  the stock has invariably popped back up to meet the dividend  The current gap represents the upside waiting for us now

My 2 Top REIT Buys Now  8 9  Dividends  25   Upside Ahead  
These 2 REITs are solid buys now especially  as I mentioned above  with interest rates set to fall  That sets up a nice two part tailwind as these REITs  borrowing costs drop and income starved buyers pile into their stocks 
There s just one problem  I prefer more of my return in cash than these two can provide and we don t want to wait a decade to get a 7   payout  especially when there are bigger dividends on the table right now 
That s where the 2 other REITs I have for you today come in  Take a look 
High Dividend REIT Buy No  1 taps its parent company s massive resources to borrow cash cheap  reinvest it in a diverse portfolio of commercial properties and hand you the proceeds in the form of a rock steady 7  payout 
High Dividend REIT Buy No  2 boasts a genius business model that sets it up to benefit from rate cuts   but also positions it to gain if Powell has a change of heart  Plus  this off the radar pick hands you a massive 8 9  dividend 
Thanks to their ridiculously cheap valuations  these 2 picks are also poised for a nice hit of upside  especially as falling rates drive the income starved masses into their huge and safe cash payouts

I want you to think about your very first reaction when you flick on the TV and see the Dow has crashed 300  500 even 800 points  It feels like you re drowning  right 
It s physical  like a gasp after falling into a cold lake  Your first instinct is likely to reach for the closest  life preserver   For most folks  that means panicking and flipping holding after holding over to cash 
You ve probably made this mistake  You might ve made it last Christmas  when many investors  burned by last year s selloff  threw in the towel  
  just in time to miss the 18  total return stocks have delivered since 
That s no isolated incident  Look at the dips the market s seen on its way to a 253  return in the last decade  Clearly  buying each one would have amplified your gain 
Our Next  Buy the Dip  Opportunity Is Here 




Your Best Move for  Pullback Proof  Gains
Look  I m not going to suggest we plunge into an index fund like the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   Instead  we ll take out some  insurance  on our gains by picking some of the best stocks in my favorite hunting ground for 5   dividends   
REITs are the perfect  pullback proof  plays   for two critical reasons  which we ll dive into now  Along the way  I ll reveal two attractive  China proof  REIT picks  plus two laggard REITs that could be collateral damage in the trade war 
The Fact  REITs Beat Back Downturns
Most folks don t know this  but REITs don t fall as far as stocks in a correction  and they bounce back faster  Look at this latest pullback  the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ  barely missed a beat  while the S P 500 flamed out 
REIT  Life Preserver  Bobs Through the Tweetstorm 




You can see it again in last year s correction  where REITs fell half as much as stocks 
REITs Halved Stocks  Decline  




  And Bounced Back Faster




The Laggards  Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  and STAG Industrial  STAG 
This is a great time to discuss the two REIT laggards you need to dump now  because our first one is VNQ s No  5 holding  mall owner Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  whose brick and mortar tenants will have to raise prices when China tariffs rise on September 1  That comes as Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   
Simon s mall occupancy  by the way  continued to tick lower in the second quarter  to 94 4  from 95 1  in the first and 95 9  in the fourth 
And by the way  the REIT s 5 3  yield is a mirage it only exists because the stock cratered 30  in the last year 
A Classic Sucker s Yield




Another REIT  STAG Industrial  STAG   might also take you in with its 4 9  monthly payout 
But I m worried about STAG Industrial  NYSE STAG   which devotes a lot of space to the slowing car business and trade sensitive areas like logistics  containers and machinery 
STAG s Weakness Is Obvious

So take a pass on these two and add stability  and growth  to your portfolio with  
The Winner  National Storage Affiliates  NSA 
Self storage is a great business all you have to do is hand out the keys to the lockers and dust and sweep the place every once in a while  Self storage REITs are also oblivious to trade and benefit from long term trends  like baby boomers downsizing 
Enter NSA  the smallest player in the space  with 729 properties across the US and a market cap of just  1 8 billion 
But going small pays in this sector  because few folks realize NSA has one of the highest yields in the business  at 3 9   plus the fastest dividend growth 
As I wrote in     a rising dividend is the key driver of share prices  NSA is the poster child  with a surging payout that s paced the stock ahead of all other self storage REITs  Check out how NSA s stock rises with each individual dividend hike  The pattern is unmistakable 
A Growing Dividend Is Your Best Pullback  Insurance 




It follows  then  that NSA should continue rising so long as its dividend keep popping higher  That s a lock  funds from operations  FFO  the REIT equivalent of earnings per share  surged 12  in Q2  and the payout is a manageable  for a REIT  at 80  of FFO 
Now let s move on to our second reason why REITs are critical to fending off a pullback and setting yourself up for market beating longer term gains 
The Fact  Collapsing Rates Will Ignite REITs

143450,364965,SPG,These Brazen Insiders Are Buying Their Own 9 7  Yields Like Crazy,opinion,"Insider buying can be a great indicator for us income investors to buy alongside management  After all  when the big bosses reach into their own pockets to purchase their own payout streams  it s a signal that they are confident in more than just the next dividend 
They believe their stock has upside  too  Often this results in total returns  including dividends  up to 214   I ll show you some examples  and also break down some current  buy  signals  in a moment 
First  let me make sure we are not mixing up insider buying with insider trading  They are two different things  Insider trading is when someone uses private information that you and I don t have  It s illegal 
But insider buying is perfectly legal  It occurs when an officer  think CEO or CIO   someone on the board of directors or another employee on the  inside  buys shares in his or her own company  They make those trades based on already public information  which is fine  And naturally  when they make big purchases  that vote of confidence means a lot more than the average investor s 
Let me show you a great example of how a big insider buy signaled 214  gains ahead for investors who were paying attention 
Ivan Kaufman is founder and long time boss at  Arbor Realty Trust   NYSE ABR   a REIT that makes loans for commercial and multifamily properties  and yields a gaudy 9 5   
Three years ago  Kaufman owner of 740 000 Arbor shares made a daring move for the then tiny company  dishing out  250 million to buy a commercial lending agency and its in house technology platform 
Fast forward to today  and the new and improved ABR is 3 times as valuable in terms of market cap 
 Skin in the Game  Triples ABR s Value




Meanwhile long term care specialist  Omega Healthcare  Investors Inc  NYSE OHI  had a mostly middling 2017 that turned wretched in the final quarter  But during that final quarter  insiders bought  5 8 million worth of stock Omega s highest three month value of insider buying in the 14 years of insider transaction data I mined 
It was nice timing for the big wigs  who banked fast 59  total returns  including dividends  
Omega s Higher Ups Bought the Dip and Banked 59 




Of course big insider stakes like these are rare  But given the big return potential  they are always worth searching for 
Management involvement is something I look for in our   I love seeing insider involvement in REITs  given the long term nature of their property holdings 
It s one thing for an insider in a tech company to buy more stock in anticipation of a brand new product lifting the stock for a year or two  But with REITs  insiders aren t just looking for a quick pop they re making calculated buys of their own cash cows  Big dividends plus 50  to 100   price gains is how you get rich investing in REITs 
Let s review two more landlords  yielding 8  and 9 7   with insiders buying hand over fist right now 
 RLJ Lodging Trust   NYSE RLJ 
Dividend Yield  8 0 
RLJ Lodging Trust  RLJ  is a hotel REIT that focuses on  premium branded  focused service and compact full service hotels   It leases out to a wide variety of blends  including 
Marriott International  MAR   Marriott  Residence Inn  CourtyardHilton  HLT   Hilton  Hilton Garden Inn  Hampton Inn  Homewood SuitesChoice Hotels  CHH   Sleep Inn
Recently  two insiders decided that now is the time to buy their own shares  A week ago  Director Patricia Gibson bought 10 000 shares worth  163 700  bringing her total holdings to 58 619 shares  Director Robert La Forgia bought half as much 5 000 shares worth  78 500 on Aug  15  which comes after another 5 000 share buy on June 3 at a cost of about  85 250 
They see value in RLJ s recent dip 
12  Off This Hotel REIT




The problem  This isn t just some recent dip  The past three months is just a microcosm of the company s longer term trend 
When a Stock Splits the  Wrong Way 




Problem is  RLJ s brands are largely in the middle and upper middle areas of the economic spectrum  That s not where you want to be  I recently wrote that  with few exceptions  the smart money is chasing premium customers  A couple REITs are   But nothing really sets RLJ apart  and it shows 
I have other issues  too  SunTrust analysts recently downgraded RLJ from Hold to Sell on general worries about burgeoning labor costs weighing on hotel REIT margins  RLJ s dividend hasn t budged since 2015  which is another black mark  So is roughly  700 million in cash versus  2 2 billion in debt 
RLJ s insiders might indeed get some long term value out of their recent buys  but I m not ready to step in just yet 
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers  SKT 
Dividend Yield  9 7 
Stop me if you ve heard this already   
Gymboree  Charlotte Russe  Things Remembered  Payless ShoeSource  Diesel  Barneys New York  These are just a few of the major retail bankruptcies announced in 2019 and we still have several months to go  Retail REITs are unsurprisingly taking it on the chin  with Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  and Taubman Centers  TCO  off about 12  13  during a rocky but still booming year for the broader markets 
But Tanger Factory Outlet Centers  SKT  off 29  year to date is perhaps the biggest disappointment in the group 
The Market Has Left Retail REITs Behind




It wasn t supposed to be this way 
Tanger isn t a traditional mall REIT  It specializes  as the name indicates  in outlet malls  which are open and not nearly as expensive to operate and maintain as regular malls  They typically don t have gigantic  anchor  stores a la Macy s  M  and JCPenney  JCP  that are difficult to fill when the tenant moves out  They re a destination  People go out of their way to shop there  making them seemingly more resistant to Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and the march of e commerce 
Two insiders seem to be buying a hopeful bottom  Steven Tanger CEO and son of founder Stanley Tanger recently bought 10 000 shares worth  144 760 to bring his stake up to 1 188 888  Director Thomas Reddin made a six digit purchase as well  snapping up 7 000 shares worth  102 340  And it s hard to fault them  They bought in at a nearly 10  yield and just 6 times adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  
But those cash flows are shrinking  Trailing 12 month AFFO is off 3  year over year  The company is guiding for an 8  decline in full year AFFO  Portfolio occupancy actually grew in Q2  from 95 4  to 96 0   but at the midpoint of full year guidance  Tanger expects that to shrink to 95  
Tanger isn t necessarily disaster in waiting  AFFO easily takes care of the dividend  interest coverage is much higher than necessary  SKT could be a sneaky bargain waiting in the wings  But it has to show investors clearer signs of a longer term recovery before I can consider this struggling outlet chain a dependable retirement buy 
Urgent REIT Alert  2 Picks for 100   Gains and 8 9  Yields
Real estate investment trusts  REITs  are such a powerful dividend tool that they can make the difference between just getting by in retirement   and breezing by 
Retirees that have a healthy allocation to REITs clip vacation pictures for their photo albums 
Retirees that don t  They greet you at Walmart  NYSE WMT  
But the need to buy REITs for your retirement portfolio has gone from  pressing  to  urgent   Because my Triple Digit Profit System just did something it hasn t done since 2015  It tripped its final indicator for us to dive into a totally ignored corner of the market 
The last time all five of my indicators flashed green  like they are this very minute   the group of stocks I want to show you in my brand new  where cash dividends of 6   7  and even 8  are commonplace started red hot rallies that resulted in triple digit profits 
One member of this snubbed group of stocks a rock steady  landlord  spinning off a 7  plus cash dividend did something that income plays just aren t supposed to do 
It soared for a market crushing 580  return 
Doubling the Market With Real Estate Sounds Crazy  But  




It wasn t alone  Another one of these overlooked cash machines produced a total return of 379  in little more than six years  You re lucky to get 100  out of the market in that amount of time 
And because this stock had such a large dividend  a big slice of those returns were in cold  hard cash 
That was four years ago  Fast forward to today  and the Federal Reserve has put its hand on the easy money spigot  triggering the last of my five buy signals  And now  I have another pair of urgent REIT buys boasting triple digit price potential and yields of nearly 9  that I want to email to you now 
The payouts are simply  going parabolic   but it s important that you add these stocks to your retirement portfolio now  Because when their prices go out  you won t just miss out on their triple digit gains but those dividends will shrink on new buyers by the day

143497,365012,SPG,Near Term Outlook For Retail REIT Stocks Appears Bright,opinion,"Real estate investment trusts  REITs  that are engaged in owning  developing  managing and renting space in a variety of retail real estates are categorized as Retail REIT  These retail real estate assets include regional malls  outlet centers  grocery anchored shopping centers  as well as power centers which include big box retailers  In addition  net lease REITs enjoy ownership of freestanding properties  wherein both rent and majority of operating expenses for the property are borne by the tenant Strength of the economy  together with the job market environment  plays a key role in shaping up the retail REIT industry s performance  as these determine consumers  spending capacity for buying retail goods and services  Moreover  as purchase of retail goods and services takes place through multiple channels  it plays a crucial part in determining the demand for the retail real estate space So here we go through the major themes in the industry Healthy U S  Economy  The domestic economy has been resilient and hiring continues to be strong  This is boosting consumer confidence and indicates decent consumer spending in the months ahead  This is anticipated to send across positive ripple effects across the industry Omni Channel Strategy  Admittedly  e commerce is gaining market share from the traditional brick and mortar stores and forcing retailers to reconsider their physical footprint and focus more on investing in online platforms  Though this has raised concerns over the fate of physical stores and landlords  cash flows  the latest trends indicate that despite the rising popularity of e commerce  omni channel will keep being the focal point for retailers  while physical stores will remain an integral and effective sales channel  This is because  despite choosing online retailing options  consumers prefer exploring the option of visiting physical stores as well In addition  options like free shipping and returns offered with online sales  have led to e commerce becoming an expensive platform  affecting retailers  profit margin  This has prompted them to focus more on in store pick up of online purchases  such as BOPS   buy online  pick up in store  and BOSS   buy online ship to store   Retail real estate landlords are also embracing digitally native brands and offering incentives  helping them open  operate and scale stores as a complement to e commerce  Therefore  retailers that focus on omni channel model will likely navigate well through the retail apocalypse and REITs that support their real estate needs will benefit Structural Changes to Continue  With changing consumer preferences  right sizing of footprints and store closures would continue  while the ones unable to cope with competition will resort to bankruptcy filing  These will lead to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions  Nevertheless  to counter these challenges and in a bid to lure customers  retail REITs are expected to continue with the transformation initiatives of their traditional retail hubs into entertainment destinations and lifestyle resorts  The REITs are likely to avoid high dependence on apparel and accessories and rather focus on expansion of dining options  opening movie theaters  as well as offer recreational facilities and fitness centers  Additionally  focus on mixed use development is likely to continue  which has gained immense popularity  of late  although with huge outlay for refurbishments  growth in profit margins of retail REITs in the near term might be affected Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe  industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  100  which places it at the top 39  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive funds from operations  FFO  per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT and Equity Trust   Retail Industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector  as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite in a year s time The industry has gained 5  during this period compared to the S P 500 s fall of 1   During the same time frame  the broader Finance sector has declined 4 8  One Year Price Performance

143544,365059,SPG,Simon Property  SPG  Lags Q4 FFO And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Simon Property  SPG  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  3 23 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 24 per share  This compares to FFO of  3 12 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  0 31   A quarter ago  it was expected that this shopping mall real estate investment trust would post FFO of  3 02 per share when it actually produced FFO of  3 05  delivering a surprise of 0 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times 
Simon Property  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Retail industry  posted revenues of  1 46 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 67   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 43 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Simon Property shares have added about 8 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7 9  
What s Next for Simon Property 
While Simon Property has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Simon Property was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  2 94 on  1 45 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  12 52 on  5 89 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  REIT and Equity Trust   Retail is currently in the bottom 35  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/simon-property-spg-lags-q4-ffo-and-revenue-estimates-200382549,200382549

While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns

Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  SPG is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/simon-property-spg-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200383681,200383681

143551,365066,SPG,Silicon Valley VCs are growing wary of on demand delivery,news,"By Paul Lienert  Heather Somerville and Alexandria Sage  Reuters    Michael Moritz   chairman of Sequoia Capital and one of the most successful venture capitalists in history   says a simple vision led him to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in on demand delivery startups    The movement of goods and services and people  by easier  more convenient means   he said in an interview   That s a huge trend  enabled by smartphones   Led by Sequoia and another blue chip Silicon Valley firm   Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers   venture investors have poured at least  9 billion into 125 on demand delivery companies over the past decade  including  2 5 billion this year  according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available data  But that torrent of money has slowed to a relative trickle in the last half of this year  and many VCs have lost faith in a sector that once seemed like the obvious extension of the success of ride services juggernauts such as Uber  The bulk of this year s investment   about  1 9 billion   came in the first half of the year  Only  50 million has been invested so far in the fourth quarter  the Reuters analysis found  Several prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists said in interviews that they now believe many delivery startups could fail  leaving investors with big losses   We looked at the entire industry and passed   said Ben Narasin  of Canvas Ventures   There is more likely to be a big  private equity style roll up than a venture style outcome    Reuters analyzed investment in on demand delivery startups using publicly available data from the companies  their backers and third party websites including Crunchbase  PitchBook and MatterMark  The analysis likely missed some investments because private firms and their investors do not always disclose funding details  Delivery startups continue to grapple with fierce competition  thin margins and a host of operating challenges that have defied easy solutions or economies of scale  venture capitalists told Reuters  Widespread discounting and artificially low consumer prices have made on demand delivery  a race to the bottom   said Kleiner Perkins partner Brook Porter in an interview   That firm has not invested as heavily or broadly in the sector as Sequoia  but has backed U S  startups DoorDash and Instacart and China based Meican   This year has seen high profile failures  including U S  meal delivery firm SpoonRocket  which went down in March  and PepperTap  an Indian grocery delivery service backed by Sequoia that folded in April  DoorDash  another of Moritz s investments  was able to close its latest venture funding round last March only by cutting the value of its share price by 16 percent  according to data from CB Insights  The entry of Uber last year into the delivery business with UberEats  for food  and UberRush  for packages  promises to make life more difficult for smaller start ups  Established logistics companies including Amazon  O AMZN  and DHL  DHL UL  are also exploring local on demand delivery  Sequoia has backed at least 14 local delivery firms  among them four in the United States  five in China and four in India  Sequoia did not respond to Reuters requests for a response to rising VC skepticism of delivery firms  Venky Ganesan  of Menlo Ventures  said the sector has no clear way to cut costs or boost revenue    You can t raise prices on consumers  and you can t cut labor costs   he said   The core unit economics didn t make sense   Dalton Caldwell  a partner at Y Combinator   the prestigious tech incubator that birthed a number of delivery startups   was also skeptical  though he thought companies with top notch operational capabilities could succeed  Many delivery startups  he said   make the assumption that once you get bigger  things will get easier  and that s wrong  There is driver churn  operations people that cost money  more support costs   LOCAL DELIVERY  DASHERS  DoorDash  founded in 2013 by four students in a Stanford University dorm room  has raised nearly  200 million from top venture firms  Focusing on food and alcohol delivery  DoorDash has agreements with local restaurants  including franchised outlets  in dozens of cities in the U S  and Canada  But Doordash still has to figure out comparatively simple challenges   like how to economically deliver pizzas to the fifth floor of a college dorm with no easy street access   There is an opportunity to redefine local commerce in cities   says DoorDash co founder Stanley Tang   But we have to figure out  what are the operational challenges  and then how we can scale it up    Deliv  a same day small package service aimed at online shoppers  uses a model similar to Uber s  with contractor drivers delivering packages  The company has venture investors and has also lured funds from  United Parcel  Service  N UPS  and some of the largest U S  mall owners and operators  including Taubman Centers  N TCO  and Simon Property Group  N SPG   Founder and CEO Daphne Carmeli says that because Deliv does not maintain warehouses or a vehicle fleet  traditional couriers such as FedEx  N FDX  would be  challenged  to match the startup s low costs  Uber  however  doesn t face those same challenges  The company has not said how much it has invested in UberEats or UberRush  or whether either turns a profit  and a spokesman declined to comment on those businesses   But Uber does turn a profit on rides services in many cities across the globe and has amassed a war chest of  15 billion  providing ample resources to expand into delivery  Carmeli is sanguine about the Uber challenge   Moving people is fundamentally different from moving packages   she said   Predictability trumps speed    ROBOTS TO THE RESCUE  Silicon Valley veterans have long recognized the difficulty in the local delivery business  The online grocery firm Webvan and the urban delivery company Kozmo were two of the highest profile flops in the late 1990s dot com boom  Technology was supposed to make things different this time  and smartphone apps that connect customers with fleets of independent drivers have helped   But the technology that some believe could transform the sector   driverless vehicles and sidewalk robots   remains far from a practical reality  leaving many startups with no clear path to innovate their way to profitability anytime soon   We think automated deliveries can complement our human fleet of dashers   said Tang  of DoorDash   But the company has no timetable for deployment   Deliv s Carmeli is more skeptical    An autonomous vehicle is not going to pick up a package at your retailer  then walk the stuff up to the customer s doorstep and get a signature   she said   Any delivery company looking to replace humans with robots will have to catch Uber  The company has hired robotics experts from Pittsburgh s Carnegie Mellon University and executives with deep automotive expertise  and is working with major automakers including General Motors  NYSE GM  and Toyota  In August  Uber acquired Otto  a startup outfitting long haul trucks with self driving technology  Since the acquisition  the Uber Otto alliance has delved into logistics  mapping and tracking  which can be deployed for delivery trucks even as work continues on self driving systems  said Otto co founder Lior Ron  But delivery companies who can t find a business model that pays with human drivers aren t likely to find one that will work without them  Ron said   
 I don t think you can bank on the robots to come and save the day  ",2016-12-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/silicon-valley-vcs-are-growing-wary-of-on-demand-delivery-447330,447330

143593,365108,SPG,Will Simon Property s Efforts Suffice To Battle Retail Blues ,opinion,Simon Property Group Inc    NYSE SPG   has a diversified exposure to retail assets in the United States and abroad  Further  the company s efforts to support omni channel retailing  portfolio restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet augur well for long term growth However  as Simon Property is trying to counter the choppy retail real estate environment through various initiatives  these require upfront costs and thus  it is likely to limit any robust growth in the company s profit margins in the near term  Also  stiff competition from online sales and rise in interest rate pose challenges for the company Notably  Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio  and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments  In fact  at the end of the first quarter  it had redevelopment and expansion projects  including the addition of new anchors  in progress at 28 properties across the United States  Canada and Asia In May  Simon Property launched a  4  billion of investment plan to transform its properties aimed at creating value and drive footfall at the company s properties  The transformational plans included addition of hotels  restaurants and luxury stores Also  later in May  Simon Property announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio  transforming those into retail  fitness  dining and entertainment hubs In fact  earlier in April  Simon Property announced the company s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores  at five major locations  The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall  Brea  CA   Burlington Mall  Burlington  MA   Midland Park Mall  Midland  TX   Ocean County Mall  Toms River  NJ  and Ross Park Mall  Pittsburgh  PA   Enhancements to the properties included entertainment  fitness  restaurants and dining pavilions  residential  as well as new retail brands The company has also resorted to micro retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20 200 square feet of space  With such a huge pipeline  the company is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company s properties In addition  Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet  At the end of first quarter 2018  the company had more than  7 0 billion of liquidity  This comprised cash on hand  including its share of joint venture cash  and available capacity under the company s revolving credit facilities Furthermore  solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that  The company has steadily raised its dividend  over the past years  increasing from  3 50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of  7 80 per share Nevertheless  with e retail taking precedence  retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating  In fact  with e commerce gaining market share from the brick and mortar stores  retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures  while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies This tepid environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions  which  however  mall landlords find unjustified  As such  retail REITs like Simon Property  GGP Inc    NYSE GGP    Kimco Realty Corp    NYSE KIM    Macerich Company   NYSE MAC   and others have felt the heat  and the companies  share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months Further  though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets  implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost  This would  therefore  limit any robust growth in its near term profit margins Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt  This  in turn  is feared to negatively impact the company s financial results and dividend payout Shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have outperformed the  it belongs to in the past three months  You can see  Simon Property has gained 6

143597,365112,SPG,Retail REITs looking pricey as Sears ponders joining mix,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Sears Holding Corp made a huge splash last week when it said it might spin off hundreds of its stores as a real estate investment trust  But the struggling retailer s move to tap into a surging commercial property market comes as the sector looks increasingly rich 
The temptation is understandable  REITs  those formed around retail properties in particular  have been one of the post financial crisis stars  The reason  juicy dividends  And  of course  six years of low interest rate policy from the U S  Federal Reserve  which have pushed bond yields to historic lows 
The S P 1500 Retail REIT industry group  which includes the likes of mall and shopping plaza owners Simon Property Group Inc   Macerich Co  and National Retail Properties Inc   delivered a total return of nearly 500 percent since March 2009  That s more than double the return of the wider stock market 
This year alone  the benchmark MSCI U S  REIT index has surged 26 percent compared with 10 percent for the S P 500 
Yet  just as Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert considers diving into this game  fund managers and analysts in the sector worry that the best days for publicly traded REITs are now behind them because they are too expensive 
 We re turning over rocks for opportunities  but it s clear that REITs are not cheap   said Joel Beam  manager of the Forward Income Opportunity fund 
Beam is not alone  The average equity income fund now holds 7 8 percent of its portfolio in REITs  according to Lipper  the same percentage as in 2009 
FED THREAT
A top risk for the group is the Fed  which is widely expected to start raising interest rates next year for the first time since the recession 
Investors have been drawn into REITs by dividend yields that now average 3 5 percent  more than a full percentage point above the yield on safer assets such as the benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note and roughly a half point higher than the yield on investment grade corporate bonds 
As such  shares of REITs are highly sensitive to any hint that interest rates could rise  a prospect that would make bonds more attractive by comparison 
In 2013  for instance  the S P 1500 Retail REIT industry group fell 21 percent during the three months of the so called  Taper Tantrum   which erupted following hints by the Fed that it would end its bond buying stimulus program   and pivot toward a tighter monetary policy 
REITs have since recovered to record highs  But analysts say that rich valuations  at a time when the expanding U S  economy should send interest rates higher  mean that another significant drop could be in the making 
The group is also substantially more levered than most other stocks  The average long term debt to equity multiple among the 22 members of the S P retail REIT industry group is 143 2 compared with just 94 7 for the S P 500 as a whole 
Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for new or refinanced debt  a factor that will further impede profit growth 
To be sure  some analysts say that certain REITs could do well  even in a rising interest rate environment   largely because they could pass on costs to their tenants in the form of rising rents 
A lack of new supply in the REIT market  as well as concerns that the European Union economy is in recession  should keep a floor on any price declines if rates were to rise  said Alexander Goldfarb  a senior REIT analyst at Sandler O Neill 
PRICEY
But even Goldfarb sees valuations stretched for several of the companies he covers 
Added Todd Lukasik  a Morningstar analyst   REITs look to be on average about 10 percent over valued   what we ve seen recently is that on days when you have a big movement upward in the yield of the 10 year Treasury  you get a pretty noticeable decline in REIT stock prices  
Income fund managers  too  say that they are put off by high valuations in the sector 

REITs now trade at an average of 23 times cash flow  Beam  the Forward fund manager said  compared with their historical average of 16 times  Should interest rates rise  he added  it will be  a little bit scary

143615,365130,SPG,Extra Space Storage  EXR  Q1 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Extra Space Storage Inc    NYSE EXR   is slated to report first quarter 2018 results on May 1  after the market closes  Both its revenues and funds from operations  FFO  are expected to register year over year growth In the last reported quarter  this Salt Lake City  UT based self storage real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 3 7   in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected growth in property rental revenues and improvement in same store net operating income  NOI   Higher occupancy and rental rates also supported growth The company has a decent surprise history  In fact  it exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 3 8   This is depicted in the graph below Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors That Might Impact Q1 ResultsExtra Space Storage is the second largest self storage operator in the United States  as well as the largest self storage management company in the nation  The company offers a wide array of well located storage units to its customers  including boat storage  recreational vehicle storage and business storage  It enjoys high brand value and robust presence in key cities The company also made concerted efforts to consistently grow its business  and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions  mutually beneficial joint venture partnerships and third party management services In addition  the self storage industry is anticipated to witness solid demand  backed by favorable demographic changes and events like marriages  shifting  death  and even divorce  Amid these  in the soon to be reported quarter  the company is anticipated to benefit from steady demand in the self storage industry  and record growth in same store revenues and NOI The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  251 million for property rental revenue reflects a sequential rise from the prior quarter figure of  246 million  The estimate for management fees and other income is pegged at  10 5 million  up from  10 1 million in the previous quarter  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter total revenues is pegged at  286 8 million  indicating a year over year rise of 9 0  However  Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  In addition  there is a development boom of self storage units in many markets  This will likely fuel competition for the company  curb its power to raise rents  and turn on more discounting Prior to the first quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at  1 09  over the past month  However  it indicates a year over year increase of 5 8  Additionally  shares of Extra Space Storage have gained 3 0  in the past three months  outperforming the 6 7  decline registered by its  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Extra Space Storage will likely beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive

they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  0 73  Zacks Rank  Extra Space Storage s Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a

143641,365156,SPG,Why Is Earnings Beat Unlikely For Kimco Realty  KIM  In Q1 ,opinion,Kimco Realty Corporation   NYSE KIM   is slated to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 26  before the market opens  Its revenues are expected to inch up in the quarter  while funds from operations  FFO  per share will witness a year over year decline Last quarter  this New Hyde Park  NY based retail real estate investment trust  REIT  reported in line results with respect to FFO per share  In 2017  the company recorded the strongest leasing volume in the past decade Over the trailing four quarters  Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in line results in the other three  recording an average beat of 0 68   The graph below depicts this surprise history Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsKimco is taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision  In fact  the company is reducing its portfolio size and channeling the proceeds toward high quality assets  Further  the company is engaged in boosting the capital structure while enhancing its growth profile and tax efficiency Kimco revealed transaction activities for first quarter 2018  The company disclosed dispositions of 21 shopping centers  spanning 2 3 million square feet  for a total  219 5 million  Of this  the company s share included  210 2 million  A portfolio of five properties in the St  Louis market was disposed of for  49 5 million  Along with that  five property portfolio  located in Florida and Georgia  was sold for  72 7 million However  the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers  shopping preference through online channels  resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot com bandwagon  These made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years  while others unable to cope with competition  are filing for bankruptcies These emerged as serious concerns for retail REITs as it is limiting demand for the retail real estate space considerably  Moreover  the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions  which mall landlords find unjustified Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing omni channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers  it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results Furthermore  as part of its portfolio upgrade strategy  Kimco is aggressively disposing of non core assets  Also  the company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018  While such efforts are encouraging for the long term  the earnings dilution  led by high disposition activity  cannot be averted in the near term  Therefore  these moves are expected to hurt Kimco s growth momentum in the to be reported quarter Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  298 4 million for the quarter under review  reflecting projected growth of 3 1  from the year ago period Kimco s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 36 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month  The figure also witnessed a decline of 2 7  from the prior year quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat FFO estimates this time around  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below You can uncover the best

143678,365193,SPG,Simon s Yield Above 5   Safe Income Or Value Trap  ,opinion,"Retail REITs have significantly underperformed the rest of the market as rising interest rate fears and growing Internet competition weigh heavily on brick and mortar retail properties  This article reviews the current state of one retail REIT in particular  Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   and then concludes with our views on whether it s safe to add shares of this depressed high yielder   5   or if it s just a dangerous value trap to be avoided 
The Business 
Simon owns  manages and develops retail real estate  It s a member of the S P 100  and its current market cap is approximately  54 billion  It s organized as a real estate investment trust   REIT    and it generates the majority of its operating income  79 9   from premium outlet malls  with the remainder from  The Mills   11 1   and international  9 0   The Narrative 
Simon s share price has significantly underperformed the market  as shown in the following chart  due in large part to two very negative narratives 

For starters  because Simon is a REIT  it must pay out 90  of its income as dividends for tax reasons  and this means it relies on borrowing to fund growth  The problem is that the cost of borrowing has been rising  and it is expected to keep rising  as interest rates are on an upward trajectory  This higher cost of borrowing has thoroughly spooked a lot of investors as they ve been shunning REITs like Simon  in favor of other less interest rate sensitive market sectors  And in particular  the fed s minutes released this week showed discussions of a    rate of future rate hikes  thereby causing SPG to sell off ever further in recent days 
Secondly  there is a frightening narrative that Internet retailers  such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   are going to put all brick and mortal retailers our of businesses  And this narrative has been powerful as Amazon s business continues to thrive  even though Amazon does other things besides online retail   Amazon Web Services is enormous   and many retailers  i e  the stores that rent space from REITs  continue to struggle  e g  bankruptcies  store closings  rent concessions  
The Reality 
Simon s business continues to be very strong  For example  Simon recently posted full year 2017 Funds from Operations   FFO   of  4 02 billion  or  11 21 per diluted share  compared to  3 79 billion  or  10 49 per diluted share in 2016  The company also has one of the strongest credit ratings  a high sales and rent per square foot  it is well within its debt covenants  a very strong FFO to dividend coverage ratio  and it actually just raised it s dividend  as shown in the following charts  these are not the characteristics of a dying businesses  





Valuation 
In addition to a strong business  SPG is also trading at an attractive valuation  For example  even though FFO is rising  as we covered earlier   price is falling  which makes Simon s price to FFO ratio attractive  More importantly  the company has provided a full year 2018 FFO guidance range of  11 90 to  12 02 per diluted share  This means Simon is trading at approximately 12 5 times 2018 FFO expectations  which is dirt cheap for this strong blue chip REIT 
And for what it s worth  Wall Street has a strong opinion of Simon  as well  For example  per the following chart  the average street price target for SPG is  183 23  which equates to more than 20  upside for the shares  Not bad considering you ll keep collecting the attractive 5  yield in addition to any price gains 

M A Activity 
The uptick in Mergers and Acquisitions   M A   discussions within the retail REIT space is a good sign for Simon overall  in our view  Specifically  it suggests some smart  deep pocketed  institutional investors believe the space is undervalued  For example  Unibail Rodamco  AS UNBP   Europe s largest REIT  is buying Westfield  a mall owner in the US and the UK   and Brookfield Property Partners LP  NASDAQ BPY  is trying to take over Chicago based GGP Inc  NYSE GGP   you can see GGP s rent and sales per square foot  compared to SPG  in our earlier chart  
Speaking at a recent Citigroup  NYSE C  conference  Simon s COO said the company is NOT involved in any of the current mall group M A   

 We have never done a stupid deal     You may not like us  but at least you can give us the benefit of the doubt  based on 25 years of history  

However  Simon has recently been indirectly involved considering it is the biggest shareholder of European REIT Klepierre  Klepierre has recently  an acquisition of UK based Hammerson  
One concern for investors regarding the M A activity is that they usually involve a larger company  like Simon  paying a premium for a small company  i e  the share price of the smaller company does better when the acquisition is announced considering they re receiving  not paying  the premium   Regardless  the fact that these types of discussions are occurring is a good sign for mall REITs in general  in our view 
Conclusion 
Simon Property Group is cheap  And it pays a big strong dividend  The question is whether the shares will get even cheaper  or if they have upside from here  We are making no attempt to call a near term bottom in retail REITs  but we do believe Simon Property Group is undervalued  despite the growth of online retail and the increasing interest rate environment 
One way to  play  this opportunity is by selling out of the money put options on SPG  which are currently offering attractive premium income due to the market uncertainty and fear surrounding retail REITs  uncertainty and fear cause premium income to rise  

If the shares were to get put to us at an even lower price  we d be more than happy to buy and hold for the long term  And if they never got put to us then we d also be happy to simply keep the high premium income generated by selling the puts ",2018-04-15,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/simons-yield-above-5-safe-income-or-value-trap-200305579,200305579

indicating projected growth of around 0 5  year over year Nevertheless  with more and more consumers shifting to online purchases  mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed  This has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot com bandwagon  Retailers are also reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures Furthermore  retailers unable to keep up with the intense competition in the industry have been filing bankruptcies  This is a pressing concern for retail REITs  as the trend has been significantly dragging down demand for the retail real estate space  This choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions  though the mall landlords find it unjustified While Simon Property is making efforts to beat these retail blues through various initiatives  implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost  Consequently  this might impede any robust growth in the company s profit margins in the quarter under review In addition  during the third quarter earnings release  Simon Property had revised its full year 2017 FFO per share to the range of  11 17  11 22 compared with the prior guidance of  11 14  11 22  The company had incorporated an expected 3 cents per share negative impact in the fourth quarter as a result of the ongoing repair and restoration work at the company s two centers in Puerto Rico  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at  11 21 Moreover  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at  3 11 over the past month Finally  shares of Simon Property have climbed 3 9   versus the  s gain of 14 7   in six months  time Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Simon Property will likely beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell

Inc   NYSE   NYSE SPG      and REIT Essex Property Trust  Inc   NYSE   NYSE ESS         Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  REITs  Record Growth in Q2 FFO  Occupancy Remains High With the Q2 earnings season on its last leg  this is the right time to gauge the performance of the real estate investment trust  REIT  industry Admittedly  rate hikes and a cautious approach of investors have affected gains in this industry so far this year  However  investors need to keep in mind that operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories  A number of asset categories displayed strength in second quarter 2017  with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery In fact  per a NAREIT   occupancy rates remained high in the second quarter  while funds from operations   FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs  reported growth Specifically  the Q2 scorecard reveals that the total FFO of the listed U S Equity REIT industry of  15 6 billion in the reported quarter increased 7 9  sequentially  The figure also came in 7 3  higher than the prior year quarter tally Same store net operating income  NOI  reported 3 3  year over year growth  Results were driven by segments like Single Family Homes  Data Centers and Manufactured Home Communities  which witnessed robust same store NOI growth of 6 8   5 8  and 5 7   respectively Furthermore  properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels  In fact  the occupancy rate remained unchanged at 93 4   slightly below the record high occupancy rate of 93 7  recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 Admittedly  growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies  but also driving demand for data center REITs  Moreover  the industrial asset category hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand  with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery  ecommerce gaining strength  and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy Also  the residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number in check  No doubt  the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks  However  retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants  and were able to replace with the ones which departed Among the S P 500 REIT constituents  data center REIT Digital Realty Trust  Inc   NYSE      and industrial REIT Prologis  Inc   NYSE      delivered better than expected results in the quarter  with positive surprises of nearly 3 4  and 7 7   respectively  in terms of FFO per share  Also  retail REIT Simon Property Group  Inc   NYSE      and residential REIT Essex Property Trust  Inc   NYSE      surpassed estimates  registering positive surprise of 1 2  and around 1 7   respectively Currently  Digital Realty  Prologis  Simon Property Group and Essex Property carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Note  FFO  a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs  is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenses to net income 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech

REITs  Record Growth in Q2 FFO  Occupancy Remains HighWith the Q2 earnings season on its last leg  this is the right time to gauge the performance of the real estate investment trust  REIT  industry Admittedly  rate hikes and a cautious approach of investors have affected gains in this industry so far this year  However  investors need to keep in mind that operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories  A number of asset categories displayed strength in second quarter 2017  with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery In fact  per a NAREIT   occupancy rates remained high in the second quarter  while funds from operations   FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs  reported growth Specifically  the Q2 scorecard reveals that the total FFO of the listed U S Equity REIT industry of  15 6 billion in the reported quarter increased 7 9  sequentially  The figure also came in 7 3  higher than the prior year quarter tally Same store net operating income  NOI  reported 3 3  year over year growth  Results were driven by segments like Single Family Homes  Data Centers and Manufactured Home Communities  which witnessed robust same store NOI growth of 6 8   5 8  and 5 7   respectively Furthermore  properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels  In fact  the occupancy rate remained unchanged at 93 4   slightly below the record high occupancy rate of 93 7  recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 Admittedly  growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies  but also driving demand for data center REITs  Moreover  the industrial asset category hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand  with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery  ecommerce gaining strength  and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy Also  the residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number in check  No doubt  the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks  However  retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants  and were able to replace with the ones which departed Among the S P 500 REIT constituents  data center REIT Digital Realty Trust  Inc   NYSE      and industrial REIT Prologis  Inc   NYSE      delivered better than expected results in the quarter  with positive surprises

143808,365323,SPG,The Guide To REIT Investing In A Rising Rate Environment,opinion,"When investors find themselves in a rising rate environment  one of the areas that often becomes an avoid for most is the REIT sector  This segment tends to benefit from low interest rates  and its high yields can sometimes become less attractive relative to safer bonds as interest rates increase across the board 
However  it is really such a good idea to exclude a whole market sector just because rates may be on the rise  This week s guest for the Dutram Report  Scott Crowe  the Chief Investment Strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management  doesn t think that approach is a good plan for investors  and offers up a game plan for the sector in this uncertain time 
Which REITs are the Best Now  
In today s podcast  Scott discusses which areas of the REIT world he thinks are well positioned for a rising rate world  focusing in part on companies with short term lease structures  These can more easily raise rents than those with longer dated contacts  making them less impacted by a rising rate world  This includes companies like CubeSmart  CUBE  which focuses on self storage facilities  but pays out a robust yield in excess of 4  to investors 
We also talk about some growth areas in the world of real estate investment trusts  which could be interesting options for those seeking a bit more exposure outside of the retail space  While Crowe dives deep into these trends in the podcast  he takes a closer look at the health care and data center REIT spaces in more detail  offering up investors some solid reasons for why these are areas to watch right now 
As some samples of this trend  we have CyrusOne  CONE  which pays out a three percent yield while owning and operating enterprise class data centers  And for the health care side  investors can look to firms like Omega Healthcare  OHI  which pays a seven percent yield while investing in long term care facilities  among other healthcare focused assets   But these are just examples  Scott goes over in the podcast which areas he thinks are the most promising in the REIT market right now  and which are best positioned to take advantage of changing market trends 
We also discuss two funds where Crowe s CenterSquare is the sub advisor  the Dreyfus Global Real Estate Securities Fund  DRLIX  and the AMG Managers CenterSquare Real Estate Fund  MRESX   These funds offer up investors diversified exposure to the REIT market  and we talk about what makes these products tick 
In addition to diving into the international exposure and some of the strategies for finding top REITs  we also talk about some modest holdings in retail linked names like Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  or Prologis  PLD  for these funds  and what the sector breakdown is for both of the products going forward  But check out the podcast for additional information on these funds  the REIT market  and some key growth areas to watch no matter what happens to interest rates in the near future

143823,365338,SPG,Trading Opportunities For SPG  HCA  GGP,opinion,"Simon Property Group Inc  NYSE SPG   Simon Property Group Inc  is one of the largest real estate holding companies worldwide  In particular  it is a self governing and self administered Real Estate Investment Trust  REIT   The company owns  manages  leases  acquires and expands lucrative shopping centers  Its portfolio consists of over 325 properties in various US states and Puerto Rico  which are completely or partially in the possession of the company 
These are regional  communal shopping centers and properties with multi purpose uses  Furthermore  the company holds shares in numerous shopping centers in Europe  at seven premium outlet centers in Japan  and three further outlet malls in Korea  Malaysia and Mexico  The company is one of the largest lessors of commercial retail spaces within the USA  The rental contracts are generally concluded over several years in order to avoid frequent changes 
In the daily chart  the Simon Property Group Inc  stock stands shortly before a break of the small downward trend  which in turn is deep into the correction zone of the large upward trend between 206  and 171   This is exactly in line with our Dow Theory setup  This is why one can make an entry after the closing price breaks the 186 47  mark  I would place the partial profit takings at the  198 mark  at the 210  level and at the point 2 at 229   According to the general set of rules  the stop price for this trade is located beneath the correction zone at 170 5  

HCA Holdings  NYSE HCA  HCA Holdings is an American clinic operator and is among the largest service providers in the health sector within the USA  Currently  HCA operates around 165 hospitals as well as over 110 further practice centers  In the hourly chart  the value is currently forming a bottom formation 
Since the stock has already corrected significantly and the value has run deep into the green correction rectangle  an entry could be chosen at  66  The target is located at the point 2 at approx   83  The stop should be placed beneath the green box at  64 

General Growth Properties Inc General Growth Properties Inc  NYSE GGP   is an American real estate company  The company deals with acquiring  managing and leasing commercial premises  Included in the company s portfolio are the shopping centers Ala Moana Center in Honolulu  Tysons Galleria in Washington D C   Glendale Galleria in Los Angeles and Water Tower Place in Chicago  Along with shopping facilities  these shopping arcades also offer entertainment programs such as cinemas and restaurants 
Viewed in the short term  this value has a long dry spell behind it and now seems to want to slowly recover  A very good entry opportunity has become available here  For about two weeks now  a new  young uptrend with a correction zone between  25 36 and  23 89 has been developing 
After the last course high at  27 10  the price came significantly back and entered the green correction box once more  Although the price is still in the upper area of this box  if the entire market summons up enough strength  the price could pull directly up once again  The primary target is located at the last course high  the stop should be placed beneath the green box

143824,365339,SPG,Death Of A Critical Sector,opinion,"When I was a teenager  I spent a considerable amount of time at the mall  It was a great place to hang out with friends and basically  just be out of the house 
That s less true today  Teenagers don t hang out at the mall like my generation did  And they don t spend nearly as much money at the mall as previous generations 
This may seem like a small trend  but it s anything but  Teen spending habits are forcing a reshuffling of the entire retail landscape 
Between 1956  when the first enclosed mall opened  and 2005  more than 1 500 malls were built in the U S  During the 1980s and 1990s  we had  The Great Malling of America   There were years that saw the construction of 100 malls 
But  by 1998  that kind of construction tapered off dramatically 
Today  malls are dying  There hasn t been a new enclosed mall built since 2006  Instead  they re being abandoned and torn down 
We ve all heard the massive number of store closings and layoffs announced by Macy s  NYSE M   Kohl s  NYSE KSS   The Limited and Sears  NASDAQ SHLD  over the last couple weeks 
It s projected that in the next decade  half of all enclosed malls in this country will be gone  Some companies    and their investors    will suffer  Others  as I ll show you below  will thrive 
A Crumbling Foundation
This chart fills me with mixed emotions   

This is my Prime System Retail Index  or PSR for short  It s comprised of more than two dozen retailers 
For the past 17 years  the PSR has tracked the performance of these companies during Prime Periods  times you want to own shares  and Non Prime Periods  times you want to avoid them   The chart above shows the Prime Period for members of the index    October through May 
So far  the PSR is down 4 43  for the current period  In fact  15 components are down 10  or more since the start of October  And four of them are down more than 20  
On one hand  that bothers me  But on the other  the PSR was designed to reflect seasonal spending habits of consumers  There s a mixture of big box  online  stand alone  luxury  discount  accessory  apparel and mall based retailers 
As a result  it also shows the winners and losers by segment 
I can tell you that right now  accessories are far and away the best performers  These companies largely target the female consumer  and they re generally high end brands 
The second best performers are big box stores 
But what s dragging down the PSR is discount and  not surprisingly  mall based retailers  Of the 15 components down 10  or more since October  these two groups account for 12 of them 
Sales at traditional mall anchors fell more than 30  from 2005 to 2015  This is a revenue decline from  87 46 billion to  60 65 billion  Clearly  traditional enclosed malls can t compete against online and mobile retailers 
Online and mobile shopping is still increasing at eye popping paces  Black Friday alone saw online sales increase 33   And this is obviously creating a boon for online retailers 
For example  shares of Wayfair  NYSE W  hit a 52 week low in October  They re up 37  from that point  as the online home furnishing company has seen quarterly revenue increase more than 30  year over year  Annual revenue is expected to be up nearly 50  this year 
Shares of Overstock com  NASDAQ OSTK  are up more than 50  in the past year  Meanwhile  shares of Etsy  NASDAQ ETSY  are up more than 60   as quarterly revenue increased more than 20  
All three of these are in the top 10 holdings of the Amplify Online Retail ETF  NASDAQ IBUY   It s an exchange traded fund that focuses on companies that get at least 70  of their revenue from e commerce 
Traditional malls are also being undercut by outlets  Tanger Factory Outlet Centers  NYSE SKT  and Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  are seeing strong revenue growth 
A Welcomed Demise
Last June  I wrote about the decline of malls in America  This murder is being perpetrated by millennials  And  as I see it  it s a necessary death  Malls are outdated constructs    remnants of a world that no longer exists 
We can t stop the transition that s underway in the retail space  Maybe you don t conduct the majority of your purchases online  But that doesn t mean this shift isn t happening  It means only that you re becoming part of a minority 
Once older generations start adopting online shopping en masse    and they ll be forced to   e commerce and mobile sales will account for almost a quarter of total retail sales in the next decade 
As investors  we can profit  Just know that you re not going to find a lot of opportunities in traditional mall staples    at least  not until they wise up and push into the e commerce space 
Of course  the sad truth is    for most of these companies  it s already too late

REITs  Q2 Earnings to Watch for Friday

	We are approaching the end of one of the busiest weeks in the current reporting cycle  This week has been full of activity for the real estate investment trusts  REITs  also 

	Several big shots including Avalonbay Communities Inc     and Simon Property Group Inc     have come up with their earnings releases this week and now we have another chunk of REITs that are slated to report their result on Friday  Jul 29  Among them areChesapeake Lodging Trust    Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc     and  Ventas  Inc     
	Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  for the stocks 
	Let s now check how the following four companies are expected to perform  when they report their second quarter 2016 results on Jul 29 
	Chesapeake Lodging Trust is a hotel REIT focused on investments in upper  upscale hotels in business  airport  convention markets  and select service hotels in urban settings or locations in the U S  The company has an Earnings ESP of  1 33  and a Zacks Rank  3  Despite a favorable Zacks Rank  the stock s negative ESP lowers its chances of a beat this quarter 

   

	Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc  is a hotel REIT that currently owns or holds controlling interests in upper  upscale and luxury hotel properties primarily operated under premium brands  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 04   This is a major indicator of a likely positive surprise  Moreover  it has a Zacks Rank  3  This combination of Host Hotels  Zacks Rank  3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season 
	Host Hotels is anticipated to grow its revenue per available room  RevPAR  in 2016 from that of 2015 through value enhancement and rebranding initiatives  Further  the company stands to gain from the strength in employment   business investments as well as its strategic capital recycling program  The company is likely to perform well  also due to lower supply and less disruptions  In addition  adequate liquidity and a decent balance sheet are expected to support second quarter 2016 results  read more     

   

	Ventas is a healthcare REIT that has a large and diversified portfolio in the healthcare sector with exposure to all types of facilities  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes our surprise prediction difficult 
	The company s diversified portfolio allows it to capitalize on a wide range of opportunities  Amid increasing healthcare spending  aging population and a rise in insured individuals  it is expected to see a top line boost in the to be reported quarter However  in recent times  Ventas has undertaken a spate of acquisition and redevelopment activities  Though beneficial over the long term  such activities entail huge expenses that will affect the company s near term performance to some extent  read more

Retail REITs Dip on Macy s  M  Store Closure Announcement

Shares of retail real estate investment trusts  REITs  took a hit yesterday as Macy s Inc      revealed its plan to shut down 100 full line stores  The decision was triggered by the retailer s plans to reallocate investments in stores with high growth potential and focus on its digital sales 

Though Macy s did not divulge the precise list of stores it plans to close  the news worried investors about the adverse effect of store closures on the mall traffic  sales and  finally  the cash flow of mall landlords 
	As such  shares of Simon Property Group Inc       WP GLIMCHER Inc     and Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust    slipped 2 02   3 35  and 1 87   respectively  General Growth Properties  Inc       too  dropped 3 45  
	Of late  customers  shopping preferences and patterns are changing rapidly  with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  Concerns over reduced footfall in the brick and mortar shops  amid this e commerce boom  have also forced retailers to reconsider their physical presence  This  in turn  is leading several stores to be shut down 
	In fact  in this new technology era  with retailers embracing the omni channel concept  the retail real estate landlords are compelled to give a facelift to their malls  in order to lure customers  Their ultimate aim is to see higher demand for their space and  therefore  these firms are transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones and distribution centers 
	Retail REITs are also adapting to latest technologies to offer attractive services to their tenants and mall visitors  However  implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and  hence  is likely to curtail any robust growth in profit margins of the retail REITs in the near term

143936,365451,SPG, Fairly Valued Mid Cap Stocks  Part III ,opinion,"Introduction
This is the final installment in my series of articles on fairly valued mid cap selections  My inspiration to produce these articles was at the request and suggestion from regular readers who were frustrated at the lack of coverage and or articles on mid caps  To accommodate those requests  I screened through the S P 400 mid cap index with the assumption that it represented a credible universe of high quality mid caps  The fact that I was only reviewing the S P 400 index was missed based on many comments received on my previous articles in this series  In other words  I only included fairly valued research candidates that are members of the S P 400 index in this series 
As I was reviewing this universe of mid cap stocks  it became quite clear that there were more differences between individual mid cap companies than there were similarities  Therefore  I organized the mid cap research candidates into a series based on various industries and sectors  In part 1  I focused primarily on mid cap stocks for growth  In part 2 I turned my focus towards dividend paying mid caps  However  I broke part 2 into parts 2A and part 2B where I covered regional banks and Consumer Discretionary dividend growth stocks  In this final part 2C in this article series  I am presenting REITs and real estate oriented mid caps 
Furthermore  it s important to point out that my primary objective was to present a group of apparently fairly valued mid caps based on a cursory screen  Therefore  I left it up to the reader to conduct their own comprehensive research and due diligence on any of these research candidates that appeal to them  To clarify further  throughout this series I am not suggesting that these are the best mid cap stocks to invest in  Instead  I endeavor to present mid cap selections from the S P 400 index that currently appear attractively valued 
To summarize  just as it is with every other equity class  there are many different types of mid size companies with each possessing different features and characteristics  For example  the mid cap universe contains many intriguing growth opportunities  On the other hand  the mid cap universe also contains dividend paying companies of all categories  Investors can find high yielding mid caps  moderate yielding above average growing mid caps  and everything in between  Simply stated  not all mid caps are the same  The real estate oriented research candidates presented below come in all the flavors mentioned above 
Real Estate Investments and the Liquidity Factor
The two most dominant forms or choices for equity investors are stocks and real estate  Equity investing is also referred to as ownership versus investing in debt instruments often referred to as loaner ship  In other words  equity investors position themselves as owners of the asset they are investing in  In contrast  investing in debt instruments is mostly associated with a guaranteed or consistent income stream in the form of interest payments  However  debt instruments typically do not afford the opportunity to participate in growth or gain in excess of your original investment  On the other hand  although equity investing implies participating in potential gains  it is also more exposed to participating in potential losses  These factors represent the primary difference between equity investing versus debt investing 
In regards to the two major equity classes  real estate or stocks  the primary differentiator has traditionally been liquidity  Common stocks are publicly traded on stock exchanges and therefore readily liquid  In contrast  real estate typically requires a significant effort and time in order to complete a sale  In other words  real estate is generally not considered a liquid investment class 
Furthermore  liquidity can be either a positive or negative attribute  On the positive side  if you need to raise cash for any reason  the liquidity provided with stock ownership easily facilitates that need  Moreover  depending on how much cash you need  you might only be required to sell a small portion of your holdings  However  if for example you are invested in a rental property such as a house  you cannot simply sell the kitchen and keep the rest of the house  If you need cash out of an investment  you are forced to sell the entire asset  Under these circumstances  liquidity is a positive for stocks and a negative with real estate 
On the other hand  liquidity can also be a significant negative  With the liquidity provided with stocks  you might need cash during a bear market and consequently be forced to sell your asset for less than it s worth  Or worse yet  a bear market can incite panic in the investor s mind causing them to sell their asset at a loss simply because they have become frightened  In contrast  the time and effort required to sell a piece of real estate may save the investor from making such a mistake  In that case  real estate s lack of liquidity can be a real benefit 
Legendary investor Warren Buffett explains the liquidity factor far better and in a much more entertaining fashion than I  Warren is comparing two illiquid real estate investments he made in the early 1990s to his experience in owning stocks  The following excerpt from his summarizes and clarifies what I said above 
 There is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks  Stocks provide you minute to minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farm or the New York real estate  It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations placed on their holdings   and for some investors  it is 
After all  if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his   and those prices varied widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state   how in the world could I be other than benefited by his erratic behavior  If his daily shout out was ridiculously low  and I had some spare cash  I would buy his farm  If the number he yelled was absurdly high  I could either sell to him or just go on farming 
Owners of stocks  however  too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well  Because there is so much chatter about markets  the economy  interest rates  price behavior of stocks  etc   some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits   and  worse yet  important to consider acting upon their comments 
Those people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often become frenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering an implied message of  Don t just sit there  do something   For these investors  liquidity is transformed from the unqualified benefit it should be to a curse 
A  flash crash  or some other extreme market fluctuation can t hurt an investor any more than an erratic and mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment  Indeed  tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if he has cash available when prices get far out of line with values  A climate of fear is your friend when investing  a euphoric world is your enemy 
During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008  I never gave a thought to selling my farm or New York real estate  even though a severe recession was clearly brewing  And  if I had owned 100  of a solid business with good long term prospects  it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it  So why would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses  True  any one of them might eventually disappoint  but as a group they were certain to do well  Could anyone really believe the earth was going to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America  
REITs  Real Estate in Liquid Form
According to NAREIT  the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts  
 A REIT  or Real Estate Investment Trust  is a company that owns or finances income producing real estate  Modeled after mutual funds  REITs provide investors of all types regular income streams  diversification and long term capital appreciation  REITs typically pay out all of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders  In turn  shareholders pay the income taxes on those dividends 
REITs allow anyone to invest in portfolios of large scale properties the same way they invest in other industries   through the purchase of stock  In the same way shareholders benefit by owning stocks in other corporations  the stockholders of a REIT earn a share of the income produced through real estate investment   without actually having to go out and buy or finance property  
Definitionally speaking  NAREIT also explains the REIT structure as follows 
 To qualify as a REIT a company must 
Invest at least 75 percent of its total assets in real estate
Derive at least 75 percent of its gross income from rents from real property  interest on mortgages financing real property or from sales of real estate
Pay at least 90 percent of its taxable income in the form of shareholder dividends each year
Be an entity that is taxable as a corporation
Be managed by a board of directors or trustees
Have a minimum of 100 shareholders
Have no more than 50 percent of its shares held by five or fewer individuals

Investment Thesis
Although WP Glimcher is a relatively new entity with little history  I included it in this article because of its high current yield and extreme low valuation  Therefore  I believe a significant portion of the risk is already included in its price  low valuation   However  as is the case with many spinoffs  the company s high debt to capital ratio is a concern 
Company description

WP Glimcher was formed following Washington Prime Group s  NYSE  WPG  acquisition of Glimcher Realty Trust  NYSE  GRT  in January 2015  Washington Prime Group was formed in May 2014 following a spin off from Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   Today the company operates out of our headquarters in Columbus  Ohio  and we have an additional office in Indianapolis  Indiana

Investment Thesis
I included Omega Healthcare Investors based on its above average yield  consistent historical FFO growth and low current valuation  For disclosure  I am currently long OHI  and I will refer to REIT expert Brad Thomas and his article  to provide insights into this quality healthcare REIT 
Omega Healthcare Investors Inc  NYSE OHI 

Investment Thesis
I included EPR Properties as a fairly valued if not fully valued above average yield REIT with a consistent operating history based on FFO growth  Additionally  I included this research candidate because of its monthly dividend payment schedule which I felt might appeal to many dividend income investors 
EPR Properties  NYSE EPR 

Investment Thesis
My fourth and final research candidate  Jones Lang LaSalle  operates in the real estate industry  however  it is not a REIT  My primary motivation for including it as a research candidate was its low valuation indicating the potential for significant capital gains  This real estate management company does pay a small dividend but not enough to attract the dividend investor  Consequently  it is offered purely as a capital gain based on potential price recovery candidate  With this in mind  I ve included two F A S T  Graphs  with this example 
The first is a price and cash flow correlated valuation reference  and the second a price and earnings correlated valuation reference  Although the company looks attractive on both earnings and cash flows  Jones Lang LaSalle looks especially compelling relative to operating earnings 
Jones Lang LaSalle Inc  NYSE JLL 

For those readers not familiar with this company  I have included a few slides from its most recent investor presentation 

Summary and Conclusions
This concludes my series on fairly valued mid cap stocks  Not every investor may be willing to consider smaller size companies for their investment portfolios  especially those investors in retirement  However  smaller size companies generally have more room to grow than their larger counterparts  Consequently  there are those investors that prefer smaller companies on the belief that they are capable of growing faster   thereby generating larger gains 
On the other hand  my review of the S P 400 mid cap index found very few companies in the mid cap class that I considered attractively valued enough currently to include as potential research candidates  Nevertheless  at the request of several readers  I choose this series of articles on mid caps  Although I believe that the growth of a business represents one of the best sources of higher total returns  it only works when valuations are reasonable or attractive  Caveat emptor

143959,365474,SPG,Is Retail Weakness Just Seasonal ,opinion,"There was a lot of positivity coming from management teams on last week s earnings calls   One of the few areas of weakness that I heard anyone mention was from Simon Property Group Inc  NYSE SPG   which noted that retail sales at their malls continue to be soft 

 As you know  a number of retailers  both low and medium and even high end  are all seeing somewhat of a cautious consumer  And that certainly is affecting retail sales in our properties  

This echoes sentiment that was shared by the Container Store  NYSE TCS  a few weeks ago that we re seeing a broad based retail  funk    Both Simon s management and TCS  said that it s not just brick and mortar losing out to online sales either   Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  share price weakness may help confirm that 
It s very important to pay attention to weakness in retail  because consumer spending tends to be one of the first areas to lag when the economy is headed into recession   The retail weakness doesn t seem to gel with a lot of the other data that I m seeing though   Comments from Bank of America and JP Morgan each mentioned that credit card spending on discretionary items was strong   Suntrust noted that tourism in Florida is going  gangbusters  
These comments are leading me to gravitate toward another comment that Simon Property Group made about retail  June and July don t really matter all that much 

 the summer months are not big until late July and August because they re back to school  June is not an important month  Early part of July is not  So we ll see what happens 

Is it possible that the reason that retail looks notably weak is just that it s a seasonally weak time of year for retailers 
Below is a chart of the seasonality of retail sales using data from the Census Bureau   It s expressed as  seasonal adjustment factor  which means that when the reading is above one it s a relatively strong time of year and when it s below one it s a relatively weak time of year   The chart compares overall sales to sales at auto dealers and department stores 
This is indeed a weak seasonal time for department stores  which is the quintessential mall retailer   On the other hand  it s a strong seasonal time for auto sales  and as we know  car sales have been booming so far this year   Perhaps this is an indication that consumers are in an all or nothing mode   We re bingeing on things that we would normally spend on  and other categories are suffering   Maybe that bodes well for retailers come Christmas time   As you can see from the chart  November and December are the months that really matter for retailers  sales

143960,365475,SPG,21 Of 138 REITs In Up Trends  13 Beat VNQ,opinion,"Examine 138 REITs for price trend up or down
6 simple binary factors establish trend
21 in up trend  and 13 outperform REIT index 
These 21 REITs out of 138 in the Reuters DataLink database are in up trends  even if ever so slight in some cases   They may or may not be attractive to you by other metrics  but if you prefer to invest in stocks that are rising instead of falling  this batch is a good one on which to focus further fundamental examination 
Articles by   or other REIT oriented authors may be a good place to begin your research on names from this list that are of interest to you 
Independent of any fundamental views  this is the list of REITs that are moving up to one degree or another 

An up trend in this instance is defined by a binary computer filter of the tilt the tip of several moving averages  and by the stacking of shorter moving averages above longer moving averages  By using a binary  Yes No   set of selection criteria carried out with a computer  large numbers of securities can be quickly filtered to identify a list of prospects 
It s faster than manual inspection and absolutely faithful to the filter criteria  whereas inspection by eye is prone to a certain amount of wishful thinking by giving names you know or like a bit more leeway than other names  Once the binary filter reduces the universe  you can then use all the objective or subjective examination of the charts you like  as well as doing your deep dive into the business itself 
We used what might be called Moving Average Slope and Stacking based on 6 binary Yes No  1 0  measurements of the slope of the price chart as of Friday April 17  2015  shown below listed from most important parameter on top to least important on the bottom  
12 mo direction  is the 12 month average now higher than 10 days ago  Y N 
3 month av   12 mo av  is the 3 month average above the 12 mo average  Y N 
3 mo direction  is the 3 month average now higher than 10 days ago  Y N 
1 mo   3 mo  is the 1 month average now higher than 10 days ago  Y N 
1 mo direction  is the 1 month average above the 3 month average  Y N 
Price   1 mo  is the last price above the 1 month average  Y N 
The first 6 column in this image  header shaded gray  present the results of the 6 binary filter questions  The top 21 of 138 REITs are presented in this image 

The additional columns provide supplemental objective chart information
Z Scores  Z 12 mo  Z 3 mo and Z 1 mo present the number of standard deviations the price is from the corresponding 12 mo  3 mo and 1 mo moving average prices  For Z scores look out for     2 or more  as being possibly too far from its average to be likely able to maintain that distance  Those    2 are shaded pink  and those   1 80
Money Flow Index  MF14 presents the 14 day money flow index  a volume weighted version of the relative strength index   itself a measure of the tendency of the price to position itself within its average daily range   For Money Flow values over 70 are seen as overbought  and under 30 as oversold   Values   70 are shaded pink 
Directional Movement  PDI 14  MDI 14  indicates short term trend direction  A positive number means more higher highs were generated than lower lows over 14 days  and a negative number means more lower lows were generated than higher highs  Positive directional movement equals the current high minus the prior high  if the number is positive  Minus  negative  directional movement equals prior low minus the current low  For each period directional movement is positive  plus  when the current high minus the prior high is greater than the prior low minus the current low  and directional movement is negative  minus  when the prior low minus the current low is greater than the current high minus the prior high  The positive and minus directional movements are each averaged over 14 days and then the difference is calculated for PDI 14  MDI 14  
Average Directional Index Rating  ADXR 14   ADXR is a non directional trend strength indicator  based on calculation using Positive and Minus Directional Movement data  It has values from 0 to 100  Values above 25 are seen as indicating a  trending  price pattern  while values under 25 are seen as indicating a  non tending   rather sideways  price pattern  ADXR shows short term trend strength and PDI MDI shows short term trend direction 
Binary data and Z scores in the table above were produced using custom formulas in Equis Metastock with data feed from Reuters  and the other data is based on  out of the box  indicators in Metastock 
Note that Reuters adds suffixes to many securities to identify where they are traded

The 3 top performers among them were CONE  NRZ  and EXR  as this chart shows  also shows comparison with an investment grade corporate bond fund iShares iBoxx   Investment Grade Corporate Bond  ARCA LQD   in gold  since some investors have gravitated to REITs as bond alternatives in the past few years

Individual Price Charts  Computer generated binary tabular data is wonderful for sorting through large numbers of securities  and to subject selection to a limited set of strict objective guidelines  In the end  though  the human eye and brain need to look at the whole picture in a price chart with its enormous number of data points 
So here they are   charts for each of the 21 REITS  also showing the 200 day and 50 day exponential moving averages  and in the lower panel the ratio of the REIT price divided by the VNQ price

143971,365486,SPG,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   Large Cap Blend Style,opinion,The Large Cap Blend style ranks first out of the twelve fund styles as detailed in my style rankings for ETFs and mutual funds  It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 39 ETFs and 1 046 mutual funds in the Large Cap Blend style as of October 12  2012  Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the style  Not all Large Cap Blend style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 20 to 990   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Large Cap Blend style  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors seeking exposure to the Large Cap Blend style should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5 Best ETFs exclude ETFs with less NAV s less than 100 million Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsRussell Growth at a Reasonable Price ETF  GRPC  and ProShares UltraPro Dow30  UDOW  are excluded from Figure 1 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards Figure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  Best mutual funds exclude funds with NAV s less than 100 million Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsPowerShares S P 500 High Quality Portfolio  SPHQ  is my top rated Large Cap Blend ETF and GMO Trust  GMO Quality Fund  GQLOX  is my top rated Large Cap Blend mutual fund  Both earn an Attractive or better rating PowerShares S P High Beta Portfolio  SPHB  is my worst rated Large Cap Blend ETF and ProFund  Bull ProFund  BLPSX  is my worst rated Large Cap Blend mutual fund  Both earn my Dangerous rating Figure 3 shows that 448 out of the 1 599 stocks  over 51  of the total net assets  held by Large Cap Blend ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  only 2 out of 39 Large Cap Blend ETFs  less than 1  of total net assets  and 65 out of 1 046 Large Cap Blend mutual funds  less than 11  of total net assets  get an Attractive or better rating The takeaways are  you cannot simply judge an ETF or a mutual fund by a style label or its top five holdings  ETFs and mutual funds with the same style label can have drastically different holdings that will translate into significantly different returns for your investment portfolio Figure 3  Large Cap Blend Style Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   StocksSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management Investors need to tread carefully when considering Large Cap Blend ETFs and mutual funds  as only 2 ETFs and 65 mutual funds in the Large Cap Blend style allocate enough value to Attractive or better rated stocks to earn an Attractive rating  For example  here are two very different stocks that are both held by our worst mutual fund  ProFund  Bull ProFund  BLPSX  McDonald s  MCD  is one of my favorite stocks held by Large Cap Blend ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating  MCD is a model of effective capital management with a return on invested capital  ROIC  of 16 7  in 2011  This is in the 87th percentile of all Russell 3000 companies as McDonald s has improved its ROIC every year for the past decade  In spite of the recession  McDonald s has become even more profitable and efficient with their capital in the last four years  McDonald s is not only a great company  it is also an attractive stock due to the market s pessimistic view of future cash flows  The company s current stock price    92 36  implies that after tax profits  NOPAT  will permanently decrease by 10   This seems unlikely given that the company has increased its profits by an average of 11  over the past decade  Low expectations and strong historical performance make McDonald s an excellent long candidate Simon Property Group  SPG  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Large Cap Blend ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Dangerous rating  SPG has misleading earnings   its economic earnings are negative and declining while its reports accounting earnings are positive and increasing  During the 14 years in my model  the company has never generated positive economic earnings  Not only is SPG not profitable  it is also overvalued  To justify its current stock price    153 05   the company must increase profits by 12 3  compounded annually for 20 years  That is a lot of future value creation for a company that has never created value  Investors should avoid this stock BLPSX holds shares in over 400 companies  Investors would be better off allocating their money to a stock like MCD and avoiding SPG altogether rather than naively diversifying across many stocks Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Large Cap Blend ETFs and mutual funds Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst Funds Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Figure 5  Separating the Best
