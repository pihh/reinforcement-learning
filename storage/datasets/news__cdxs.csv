14789,236304,CDXS,3 Stocks Poised To Move Higher In 2019,opinion,"Now that the market is back in trend mode following a correction  we can ask the question what stocks are poised to move significantly higher in 2019  When looking for stocks that have room to run  some of the best bets are those that are moving out from a recent base after setting a new all time high for the first time in a few years 
It isn t always the first thrust to a new all time high that leads to big gains  as this sort of breakout is fairly obvious especially when a stock is extended from its last base  Rather than buying the initial surge to a new high  waiting for some sort of base to form that is 5 to 20 weeks in length and within 20 35  of the recent high is ideal  unless the stock forms such a base just below the all time high   A breakout from this base is a strong buy signal as can often lead to a significant rally when market conditions are healthy  It also helps to make sure the stock is in a top performing industry group 
Codexis  NASDAQ CDXS  broke out to a new all time high in 2018  clearing the prior high at  15 from 2010  Since clearing the high the past few breakouts attempts have failed to lead to a strong uptrend  but the price remains in a rising channel  which is bullish 

The weekly chart below shows the strong pick up in volume on the move through the 10 week MA  Look for CDXS to form a tight trading range during the next few weeks as a potential buy entry  A breakout to new all time highs from the current base on volume would be a clear buy signal 

Cyberark Software  NASDAQ CYBR  moved to a new all time high in 2018  clearing the prior high at  76 from 2015  The stall at  80 led to a three month long base that corrected 23  off the recent high  CYBR has already broken out from its base on volume but should be buyable on any test of the 10 week moving average on a weekly chart during the next few months 

Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK  moved to a new all time high in early 2018  clearing the previous high from 2014 but failing to follow through  The last breakout attempt in September failed along with the market  which led to a 22 week base that corrected 36  off the high  SPLK broke out from this base in early February but volume failed to impress  SPLK should be monitored for an entry after a few weeks of tight sideways action or on a test of the 50 day MA  Volume should come in on the next breakout if the stock is ready to launch higher 

We are currently long CYBR with a 28  unrealized gain from an entry in mid January at  79

14791,236306,CDXS,Caterpillar  CAT  Q3 Earnings Top  Stock Down On View Cut,opinion,Caterpillar Inc  s   NYSE CAT   third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents but plunged 19  from the prior year quarter  The results continue to reflect low end user demand across many of the company s businesses due to economic weakness throughout the world  The company s shares fell 1 97  in pre market trading  following the release Including restructuring costs  Caterpillar s earnings of 48 cents per share were 49  lower than the prior year quarter figure of 94 cents per share RevenuesRevenues plummeted 16  year over year to  9 16 billion in the quarter  falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 80 billion due to lower sales volume resulting from consistent weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in developing countries  Sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts  with major decline noted in the former  Caterpillar witnessed a revenue decline across all regions  Latin America was the worst  registering a 22  plunge in sales  primarily attributable to lower end user demand as a result of widespread economic weakness  In North America  Caterpillar witnessed a 20  decline in sales due to lower end user demand for infrastructure  continued weakness in mining and the impact of low oil prices  Sales in Europe  Africa and Middle East  EAME  tumbled 20  due to the weak oil and commodity price environment as well as an uncertain investment environment  Sales in the Asia Pacific region slumped 8  due to lower demand for Energy   Transportation applications Costs   Operating ProfitIn the quarter  cost of sales dropped 17  year over year to  6 527 billion  Gross profit plunged 15  to  2 6 billion  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses declined 12  to  992 million due to substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year and lower short term incentive compensation expense  Research and development  R D  expenses went down 12  year over year to  453 million Operating profit was  481 million  down 48  year over year  Lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization were partially mitigated by favorable period costs and variable manufacturing costs  The unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions  primarily in Construction Industries Segment ResultsMachinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales decreased 18  year over year to  8 5 billion  Sales of Energy   Transportation plunged 19  due to lower end user demand for all applications  Sales at Resource Industries dropped 25  owing to lower end user demand across all regions  Construction Industries sales dropped 13  owing to lower volumes and unfavorable price realization The ME T segment reported an operating profit of  366 million  plummeting 54  from  802 million reported in the year ago quarter  At the Energy   Transportation segment  operating profit dropped 16  as a result of lower sales volume partially countered by lower material costs Operating profit tumbled 8  at Construction Industries owing to lower volume and unfavorable price realization  The worst performance was witnessed at Resource Industries  with the segment incurring a loss of  77 million in the quarter compared with a loss of  42 million a year ago due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization Financial Products  revenues slipped 0 4  to  749 million as unfavorable impacts from returned or repossessed equipment  mainly in North America and lower average earning assets in Latin America and Asia Pacific were neutralized by higher average financing rates particularly in North America  Financial Products  profit was  183 million in the quarter  compared with  207 million in the prior year quarter Financial PositionCaterpillar ended the third quarter with cash and short term investments of  6 11 billion  down from  6 5 billion at 2015 end  Total debt to capital ratio was 70  at the third quarter end  down from 72  at 2015 end  The debt to capital ratio at ME T was 37 0  as of Sept 30  2016 within the company s target range of 30 45  Total cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2016 was  3 96 billion  compared with  4 86 billion in the prior year comparable period  Operating cash flow at ME T declined to  400 million in the quarter from  766 billion in the prior year quarter  Caterpillar anticipates ME T operating cash flow to exceed dividends and capital expenditures in 2016 BacklogAt the end of the third quarter  Caterpillar s backlog was at  11 6 billion  On a year over year basis  order backlog declined by about  2 1 billion  having recorded decreases in all segments  On a sequential basis  backlog declined  150 million CATERPILLAR INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    GuidanceGiven the challenging environment  Caterpillar now estimates revenues around  39 billion  as against the previous outlook of  40  40 5 billion  Further  Caterpillar now expects earnings per share  excluding restructuring costs  of  3 25  down from the earlier projection of  3 55  Restructuring costs are now projected at  800 million in 2016  higher than the prior stated  700 million  due to asset write downs recognized in the third quarter  The company remains cautious regarding 2017 and stated that sales and revenues will not be significantly different than 2016  However  given that most commodity prices have improved from the lows earlier in 2016 and assuming they remain stable and move higher in 2017  second half results will improve  Caterpillar apprehends that world economic growth will remain subdued at close to 2 5   similar to the past few years  The company will continue with its aggressive restructuring  focus on customers and on the future by continuing to invest in digital capabilities  connecting assets and job sites along with developing the next generation of more productive and efficient products Zacks RankCaterpillar currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Some other stocks worth considering in the same sector are Worthington

14792,236307,CDXS,4 Stocks  CREE  GLYC  MARK  USAT,opinion,"Cree  Inc   NASDAQ CREE   one of our swing trades  popped out of a wedge  and jumped 1 59  or 4 6   to 35 12  on 1 9 million shares traded  What you should be watching for is whether it takes out a double top at 38 50  If it does  that should lead it to 40  42  and 44  It has 8 6  
GlycoMimetics  Inc   NASDAQ GLYC  exploded on drug news on big volume on Tuesday  and when it got up to 18 at the top of the channel at the range of resistance  it backed off  It closed up 2 13  or 15   to 16 45  on 6 6 million shares traded  Let s see if it backs and fills and extends  If it does  I m looking for a 19 dollar target  and then maybe 22  The swing target I put on it on Tuesday says 22 and 25

14794,236309,CDXS,Cimpress Aims To Mitigate Risks By Decentralizing Operations,opinion,On May 15  we updated the research report on business services provider  Cimpress N V    NASDAQ CMPR   Cimpress  business is scalable and its web presence and online tools for customer use are well established  While additional demand often results in various capital investments such as additional printing presses  these fixed costs are spread over a wider revenue base  The company s solid operational position is reflected in its history of strong fundamentals  which we expect to continue  going forward Management has also decided to implement a radical change in the organizational structure by decentralizing operations to improve accountability for customer satisfaction and capital returns  simplify decision making and improve the speed of execution  With operations in about 50 locations spanning 30 countries across six continents  decentralized decision making will enable the company to be nimble and entrepreneurial  The evolved corporate structure will likely lead to more accountability as the company expands into new geographical regions and markets to strengthen its position as a leading provider of mass customization business products With the use of proprietary web based design software and advanced computer integrated printing facilities  Cimpress has a competitive advantage over traditional graphic design and printing methods  The company has shifted its value proposition away from deep discounts and free offer direct marketing efforts to tap the large market opportunity beyond the traditional base of highly price sensitive customers  At the same time  Cimpress is making steady progress with investments in new markets and its business strategy is focused on higher quality products and delivery  increased customer service and more transparent pricing to promote long term customer relationships In addition  Cimpress has been acquiring firms with complementary product offerings and expects to ramp up its revenues with operating synergies through economies of scale and technological collaboration to serve customers across the globe  Cimpress has outperformed the  in the last three months with an average return of 16  compared with a gain of 2 8  for the latter However  headwinds in currency translation often add to its woes as the company generates almost half of its revenues outside the United States  The strategic repositioning of the Cimpress brand further entails a huge risk  Presently  when the economy of Europe is highly unpredictable post the Brexit referendum  it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs  In addition  it is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members  Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non tariff barriers to trade between the U K  and the European Union  lowering productivity of the company Despite enjoying a leading position in the industry  Cimpress faces significant competition from traditional graphic design and printing companies and other online suppliers  Moreover  increasingly advanced desktop publishing software and more capable desktop printers offer small businesses another cost effective solution for their marketing needs  While these sources cannot meet the extent of Cimpress  product offerings  they can handle day to day marketing needs of small business customers  This could hurt top line growth of the company Nevertheless  we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Better ranked stocks in the industry include Codexis  Inc    NASDAQ CDXS    HD Supply Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ HDS   and KION GROUP AG   OTC KIGRY    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Codexis has a long term earnings growth expectation of 15  HD Supply Holdings has a long term earnings growth expectation of 15 7   It has topped earnings estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with a positive surprise of 3 7  KION GROUP has a long term earnings growth expectation of 6  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ,2018-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cimpress-aims-to-mitigate-risks-by-decentralizing-operations-200316456,200316456
14852,236367,CDXS,4 Stocks To Watch  AMED  FIX  TDOC  TREE,opinion,"The market is just chugging along in a down mode and unable to really get itself going  It appears to be trying to consolidate in this range  and perhaps it will get a better move going at some point  but there s still vulnerability  and the market is not oversold  Despite that  we are able to tread on the long side because every day there s stocks moving up  even in the worst markets  So let s take a look at some of the ones that popped on Tuesday 
Amedisys Inc   NASDAQ AMED  has been on our list for a long time  On Tuesday  it was up 2 56 to 47 44  or 5 7   on 700 000 shares traded  It had a long base  a breakout in April  a wedge  a flag  a crawling wedge  and a falling wedge at the end of April  at which time it went from 24 all the way up to Tuesday s high at 47 1 2  doubling in that time  Yet  with a pattern like that  momentum is very strong  If it gets through here  it could spike to the 53 55 range  with a secondary target of 60 62 
Comfort Systems USA Inc   NYSE FIX  has been in a beautiful  parallel  rising channel since October  having gone from 12  and change  all the way up to Tuesday s high of 28 80  up 1 17 to 28 79  or 4   on 635 500 shares traded  That was the highest level reached for this stock in its history  going all the way back to Jan 1997  After a massive  multi year base that was in the form of a big coiling base  it broke out  retested  and ran up  It s a very  very strong pattern  With 4 1 2 days to cover  this stock could spike up into the low 30 s 
Teladoc  Inc   NYSE TDOC  had a nice follow through day on Tuesday  after Monday s breakout  up another 1 62 to 34 82  or 4 88   on on 263 700 shares traded  It looks like it s going to hit the swing target around 36 pretty quickly  It may even get a bigger move up towards 38 40 
LendingTree  Inc   NASDAQ TREE   one of our best day trades in a while  had a very  very big day on Tuesday  up a whopping 34 91 to 117 51  or 43   on 1 3 million shares  It opened at 94 75  fell back to 93 30  ran to 119 23  before pulling back and closing at 117 51  Absolutely  all time high territory with a spike through the top of the channel  There may be some follow through that takes it into the 140 50 zone

14859,236374,CDXS,How Codexis  CDXS  Stock Stands Out In A Strong Industry ,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Codexis  Inc    NASDAQ CDXS    This is because this security in the Industrial Services space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Industrial Services space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 58 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Codexis is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have narrowed from a loss of 15 cents share to a loss of 14 cents share  while current year estimates have narrowed from a loss of 23 cents share to a loss of 21 cents share  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is also a favorable signal CODEXIS INC Price and Consensus    So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Codexis  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ,2016-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-codexis-(cdxs)-stock-stands-out-in-a-strong-industry-200148765,200148765
14861,236376,CDXS,6 Stocks To Watch  AMRS  AMSC  CLVS  CRC  LCI  MBOT ,opinion,"Wall Street took a pause and a breather and consolidated during the session on Wednesday  A lot of stocks we follow did not  They actually broke out and extended  Let s take a look at a few of them 
Amyris  Inc   AMRS 
AMRS  which had a big day on Tuesday on positive drug news  had a beautiful inside day on Wednesday on lower volume  Even though it was up just a penny to 5 48  technicals increased  and I still think this stock has a shot going into the 7  8  and 9 range 
American Superconductor Corporation  AMSC 
AMSC  after a couple days of selling  popped right back  jumping 1 41  or 11   to 13 88  on 875 877 shares traded  the biggest volume in three months  on Wednesday  In fact  intraday  it popped sharply in the morning to a high of 14 43  pulled back  and came right on again  with a terrific close  Mid channel target is 16  upper channel target 19 20 
Clovis Oncology  Inc   CLVS 
CLVS looks like it stuck its head out above resistance on Wednesday  running 1 06  or 4 23   to 26 13  on 2 5 million shares  after being held back for four weeks  If the volume picks up  I think we re still looking at 32 and 38 as targets 
California Resources Corporation  CRC 
CRC popped 48 cents  or 2 31  to 21 23  on 1 4 million shares  It s telling me it wants to go higher  At least it looks like it  It s above the 50 day  and above all three moving averages  I m looking for this stock to make a move as early as Thursday to 22 3 4  If it gets through there targets are 26 and maybe 30 
Lannett Company  Inc   LCI 
LCI had a nice day on Wednesday  It broke through resistance and extended  Not much  only 12 cents  or 1 43   to 8 52  on 1 9 million shares  but it was up another 1 17 in after hours  I like that it s moving  and if it accelerates here  look for it to run up to the 11 12 zone 
Microbot Medical Inc   MBOT 
MBOT has been up five days in a row with higher lows  and although it s not accelerating there is a big OVB improvement  It was up 23 cents  or 2 29  to 10 27  on a million shares  I think it s just a matter of time before this makes a run near 12  and a run near 13 3 4

106856,328371,CDXS,Codexis Is Chasing a Blockbuster Opportunity  Can It Compete With Gene Therapies ,news,"Genetic medicines and cellular therapies have an enormous potential to treat  and possibly cure  currently untreatable diseases  Nonetheless  it s important for investors to remember that  simpler  treatment options won t become obsolete just because gene therapy  gene editing  and immunotherapy approaches are becoming feasible 
Investors are hoping that the  simple is better  approach proves true for Codexis  NASDAQ CDXS   The company s first drug candidate  the enzyme based CDX 6114  is being developed to treat a rare disease called phenylketonuria  PKU   Can the simpler approach of Codexis compete with a growing list of gene therapies that are also targeting the disease 

An enzyme engineering platform with broad applications
Codexis isn t a biopharmaceutical company  It has developed a platform for engineering enzymes  which are complex molecules that power virtually all biological processes in living cells  Enzymes can also be added to industrial processes  health diagnostics  and consumer products to reduce energy consumption  lower input requirements  improve functionality  and eliminate toxic wastes  
Today  the company generates most of its revenue from three sources  selling enzymes that improve drug manufacturing processes  selling enzymes that improve the manufacturing process for a zero calorie sweetener ingredient from Tate   Lyle  and selling licenses to its enzyme engineering software platform  But Codexis is also eyeing a large opportunity in developing novel therapeutics  
In late 2017  Codexis and Nestle Health Science  owned by Nestle  entered into an agreement to develop rare disease drug candidates  The goal is to engineer enzymes that can be administered orally  rather than injected or given intravenously  which would provide a significant advantage in cost and convenience relative to treatments for many rare diseases 
Designing medicines that can be taken orally may not sound very novel  but enzyme based treatments are typically degraded as they journey through the gastrointestinal  GI  tract  That requires enzymatic medicines to be administered subcutaneously  which can trigger severe allergic reactions and doesn t efficiently deliver them to the liver  where they re most effective  Therefore  Codexis must engineer enzymes that are stable enough to make it through the GI tract so they can be transported into the liver    a capability uniquely accessible to Codexis 
The first asset to advance into clinical trials was the experimental PKU treatment called CDX 6114  Individuals born with PKU have a nonfunctioning copy of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase  PAH  that metabolizes the amino acid phenylalanine  Phe   When Phe accumulates to dangerous levels  it can cause significant intellectual disabilities in newborns and mental impairments in adults  Individuals must follow a strict  and expensive  diet that limits daily protein intake to just five grams and avoids the artificial sweetener aspartame  which breaks down into Phe  CDX 6114 was designed to help individuals metabolize Phe and live a normal lifestyle 
In early 2019  Nestle Health Science  which sells many nutritional products for PKU patients  exercised an option granting it exclusive rights to develop and commercialize CDX 6114  Codexis is eligible to receive up to  85 million in remaining development and approval milestones  up to  250 million in revenue milestones  and royalties on sales  
For comparison  Codexis generated  44 million in the first nine months of 2019  While the industrial business is growing  achieving success with the therapeutic pipeline could provide a significant boost  Will gene therapies stand in the way  

What s at stake for CDX 6114 in PKU 
The hypothesis supporting the collaboration between Codexis and Nestle Health Science is pretty simple to understand  Many rare diseases are caused when individuals fail to make a specific functioning enzyme  so treatments that provide a working copy could prove valuable  Of course  that s the exact hypothesis supporting the industry s pursuit of genetic medicines  
Whereas Codexis wants to provide an enzyme substitute through an orally available drug  a gene therapy aims to provide direct replacement of an enzyme by potentially fixing the genetic error at the root of a disease 
It might be tempting to think that gene therapy is the ideal solution for PKU  but not every gene therapy will succeed in providing a cure  If a gene therapy only partially succeeds in replacing adequate levels of the gene responsible for producing the PAH enzyme  then individuals might still be dependent on strict diets and imperfect treatment options  Simply put  barring the successful development of a curative gene therapy  the enzyme based approach of Codexis and Nestle Health Science could be a competitive option  
It s not much of a competition at the moment  as there s not much to compare  CDX 6114 is being studied in a phase 1b study  while early stage results for gene therapies have been unimpressive or non existent    

Data sources  Codexis  Homology Medicines  and BioMarin 
Despite the early stage nature of the industry s pipeline  the opportunity is large and the bar is relatively low  
Individuals with PKU currently have two main drug options  Kuvan and Palynziq  The two drugs  both sold by BioMarin  generated combined revenue of  396 million in the first nine months of 2019  But they re only partial solutions  
Kuvan is a coenzyme that can help to break down Phe  but it only works for individuals with milder PKU and comes with a relatively long list of side effects  It still generated  341 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2019  
Palynziq is a newer therapy  It s a substitute to working PAH enzymes required to metabolize Phe  but the drug can take up to 12 months to begin working and triggers significant side effects in most people  It comes with a black box warning for severe allergic reactions  observed in 9  of individuals in clinical trials   requires daily injections  and costs  192 000 per year  While doctors have been generally impressed with results for patients that stick with treatment  there s much room for improvement   
Competition is heating up  but investors must keep their cool
Codexis is hoping that CDX 6114 can provide a convenient and safe enzyme based treatment option for individuals with PKU  If the asset demonstrates promising clinical results in an ongoing phase 1b trial  then it could begin to factor into the pharma stock s price and the company s market valuation  After all  analysts expect Palynziq to generate over  1 billion in peak annual sales despite the drug s inconveniences and safety issues  and Codexis is valued at just  1 billion today 
However  investors do need to keep track of genetic medicines in development at Homology Medicines  BioMarin  and any other companies that throw their hats into the ring  RNA interference seems uniquely suited for a PKU treatment  but no such drugs are in development yet   If genetic medicines demonstrate a consistent safety profile and provide a cure for most individuals with PKU in early clinical trials  then CDX 6114 might have its market potential severely reduced before it even leaves the clinic  If genetic medicines only provide partial solutions  then the details and nuance might determine which approach  if any  will dominate the market 
The next batch of results from each company is likely to be available before the end of 2020  which means investors will learn quite a bit about the shape of the competitive landscape soon ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnz0t,2069559
