122472,343987,BDX,Fallout from money manager Kenneth Fisher s remarks tops  1 billion in lost assets,news,"By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber
BOSTON  Reuters    Fallout from Kenneth Fisher s alleged insensitive remarks about women escalated on Friday when a large Iowa pension plan cut ties with the money manager  whose firm has lost more than  1 billion in assets under management in the last week 
The Iowa Public Employees  Retirement System was the latest to notify Fisher Investments that it will terminate its contract with his firm  Fisher Investments manages  386 million of IPERS   34 billion trust fund 
Iowa joins pension funds run for Boston  the state of Michigan and Philadelphia in cutting ties with Fisher 
 IPERS staff has taken time to evaluate this situation  and it is our opinion that Mr Fisher s comments have damaged the credibility of the firm and its leadership   the Iowa pension plan said in a statement 
 As a result  the risk to IPERS is that the firm could lose investment talent  and or it may be unable to recruit high caliber talent in the future  Furthermore  the negative publicity will probably continue to be a major distraction to Fisher investment personnel  
Fisher Investments did not immediately comment 
In a video posted Oct  9 on Twitter  Alex Chalekian  chief executive of a financial advisory firm  called attention to comments Fisher made at a financial conference last week 
Chalekian said Fisher made derogatory comments about genitalia  picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein  among other topics  Epstein committed suicide in August while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges 
In a memo to his firm s employees sent to Reuters earlier this week by a spokesman  Fisher said   It pains me to know that my comments have caused you grief  concern  and indignation  I sincerely apologize  
SEI Investments Co on Friday said it was reviewing its business relationship with Fisher 
SEI serves as a trustee and sponsor on investment portfolios managed by Fisher for dozens of retirement plans that have included Becton Dickinson  NYSE BDX  and Co  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and Nextera Energy Inc  according to U S  Department of Labor disclosures 
 The comments made do not reflect SEI or our core values   the company said in a statement   As the trustee of certain trusts advised by  Fisher   our fiduciary duty requires us to focus on and protect the interests of the investors in those trusts  We are engaged in a due diligence review of  Fisher  and will make decisions that we believe to be in the best interests of investors after that process concludes  
Several other clients of Fisher  including Fidelity Investments  have said they are reviewing whether to keep his firm as a money manager 
The Kansas City Public School Retirement System  which has  78 million with Fisher Investments  will also review its relationship with the firm  Executive Director Christine Gierer said on Friday 
Gierer said she expects the situation will be discussed at the system s next board meeting  on Nov  4 
Fisher s setbacks come in the wake of the  MeToo movement  which has exposed widespread sexual harassment or abuse of women in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in media  politics  entertainment and business ",2019-10-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fallout-from-money-manager-kenneth-fishers-remarks-tops-1-billion-in-lost-assets-2000734,2000734

Blog Top Research Reports for Royal Dutch Shell  TOTAL and Becton  DickinsonThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Royal Dutch Shell  TOTAL and Becton  Dickinson  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Royal Dutch Shell s shares have outperformed the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry year to date   0 9  vs   0 5    The Zacks analyst believes that the Anglo Dutch company s position as a key supplier of liquefied natural gas should further benefit its long term cash flow growth on the back of attractive growth opportunities Europe s largest oil company s Q3 earnings was ahead of analysts  expectations  driven by strong performance from the Downstream and Integrated Gas units Moreover  its dividend is safe and secure  However  there are worries over drop in its cash flow excluding working capital while the company s poor reserve replacement ratio raises concerns about future production  Moreover  Shell s  1 7  2 3 billion impairment charge is expected to increase gearing  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point  You can  Shares of TOTAL have gained  8 3  in the past three months against the Zacks Integrated International Oil industry s rise of  0 7   The Zacks analyst believes that the company continues to benefit on account of strong contribution from startups and the expanding upstream portfolio that has above industry average exposure to the faster growing hydrocarbon producing regions of the world Strategic acquisitions and divestment of assets that are not in sync with its long term objectives are going to boost performance and further strengthen the company s cash flow generation capability  Cost saving initiatives are also aiding it to boost margins However  TOTAL s operations in some politically troubled

segments instills optimism in the stock Domestic revenues increased year over year in recent times  driven by segmental strength  Growth in Europe and APAC is an added positive  Expansion in gross margin is also encouraging  BD has issued a solid guidance for fiscal 2020  which is indicative of bright prospects A series of product launches is expected to boost the stock further  On the flip

122479,343994,BDX,Can Becton Dickinson  BDX  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Becton Dickinson  NYSE BDX   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this medical device manufacturer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 0 64   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Becton Dickinson was expected to post earnings of  3 30 per share  but it reported  3 31 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 30   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 05 per share  while it actually produced  3 08 per share  a surprise of 0 98  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Becton Dickinson  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Becton Dickinson has an Earnings ESP of  0 59  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-becton-dickinson-bdx-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200496690,200496690

122514,344029,BDX,Teledyne Technologies  Netgear  Boston Scientific  Medtronic And Becton Dickinson Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 16  2019    Shares of Teledyne Technologies   NYSE TDY   as the Bull of the Day  Netgear   NASDAQ NTGR   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Boston Scientific Corp    NYSE BSX    Medtronic   NYSE MDT   and Becton Dickinson   Co    NYSE BDX   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  During the recent market turmoil and amid fears of a looming recession as signaled by the inversion of yields on short and long term Treasury securities  there s been renewed interest in defensive stocks that are naturally resistant to changes in the economic cycle The reasoning is that companies that provide the goods and services that people  companies and even governments buy in all economic situations will maintain share value even as tech companies who are much more dependent on the business cycle suffer Health Care and Pharmaceutical stocks are an obvious choice  as are Consumer Staples and Utilities  Sometimes overlooked  the Defense Industry also generally holds up well during tougher economic conditions Teledyne Technologies offers the predictability of the Defense stocks  but also offers diversification into adjacent businesses that are minimally economically sensitive  Though it was initially focused on the defense industry   especially aerospace   Teledyne now provides cutting edge technology for medical imaging  deepwater oceanographic exploration and research  manufacturing automation and air and water testing With annual sales north of  3B  Teledyne receives about a quarter of revenues from the US Government  with the remaining 75  spread fairly evenly among Offshore Energy and Marine Instrumentation  Electronic Testing and Measurement  Commercial Imaging and Aerospace Industrial Since 2000  the company has increasingly diversified its lines of business  even as it divested operations in less profitable businesses like Aerospace Engines and Printed Circuits  The result has been a steady increase in gross margins Teledyne constantly seeks to reduce complexity and overhead  emphasize key customers and products and improve pricing on niche products For the past two decades  Teledyne has delivered consistently rising revenues  net earnings and cash flow  Over that period  the shares have risen more than 3200    easily outpacing the S P 500 and the Aerospace industry average Thanks in part to a stellar earnings history   including 20 consecutive beats of the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate  Teledyne shares have marched steadily higher  even shrugging off much of the recent trade and interest rate related volatility While sales growing in high single digits and earnings in the mid teens might not sound spectacular  it s a very comforting pattern in uncertain times  Last quarter s 17  beat of the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate was a standout in an earnings season that mostly saw more modest increases Estimates for full year 2019 earnings have risen from  9 35 share to  9 95 share in the past 30 days   a 12  increase over 2018  Those recent revisions earn Teledyne a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Teledyne s corporate slogan  Everywhereyoulook  is a nod to the company s industry leading imaging equipment as well as the ubiquity of its instruments and equipment in a wide range of modern equipment The company s proven track record  consistent performance and continued opportunities for growth and margin improvement make it a sound choice to anchor a portfolio during uncertain times  It s not a great time to be in the network equipment business  The US China trade dispute threatens to increase prices for firms which are heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and a threatened global economic slowdown would mean significantly reduced demand for finished products Netgear now finds itself stuck between the proverbial rock and hard place  with planned tariffs potentially increasing the cost of its products   manufacturing of which is outsourced to several other companies  primarily in China and Vietnam   just as demand for its commercial networking equipment seems likely to wane The products Netgear makes for the home consumer market tend to sell consistently  regardless of economic conditions  but the businesses that purchase more expensive switches  network appliances and storage solutions tend to ramp up their spending during boom times and cut back sharply when times are tougher The e commerce industry in particular tends to need additional network equipment immediately when sales are booming and is generally not price sensitive because they can make back the investment quickly by having fast and reliable networks  In lean times  however  there s generally plenty of network capacity and delaying the purchase of upgraded equipment Enterprise network equipment also typically has a usable life in excess of the length of time the owner needs it  It becomes obsolete before it wears out  Unfortunately this means it s a cash cow for equipment resellers who can repurpose pre owned equipment from large businesses as an upgrade for smaller businesses at a much lower cost than buying new Netgear shares are down more than 35  so far in 2019  badly lagging the S P 500 and the Hardware industry  A bottom line earnings beat in July breathed a bit of new life into the shares  but when you break down the report  it wasn t really all that strong Quarterly net revenue of  231M was the lowest level in more than two years  Operating margin of just 4 4  was more than 50  lower than the previous three quarters and though net earnings of  0 28 share exceeded already lowered expectations  that number was also down more than 50  than the previous quarter Each of Netgear s three global regions showed a decline in revenue  The Americas were down 9 9   Europe  Middle East and Africa were down 10 6  and Asia Pacific was down 6 3  Overall sales in 2019 are expected to be  1 05B   25  lower than the previous year   and 2020 is only a bit better at  1 08B Negative momentum on analyst revisions earn Netgear a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Additional content FDA Resets PAD Guidelines  The Road Ahead for Device MakersFollowing the FDA s last week announcement of its renewed guidance on the treatment of peripheral artery disease  PAD   medical device companies sound upbeat about the development so far More precisely  the updated guidance for the physicians is related to the benefit risk profile of peripheral paclitaxel devices intended for the treatment of PAD The FDA StatementEarlier in 2019  the FDA had notified health care providers about a late mortality signal in patients treated for PAD in the femoropopliteal artery with paclitaxel coated balloons and paclitaxel eluting stents In its revised guidance  the regulatory body has provided the advisory panel s analyses and recommendations for healthcare providers  It has also laid an emphasis on taking additional steps to address this signal including coordination with manufacturers on updates to device labeling and clinical trial informed consent documents for incorporating information about the late mortality signal Among the recommendations  the FDA noted that health care providers should discuss the risks and benefits of all available PAD treatment options with patients  This is because for many patients  alternative treatment alternatives like paclitaxel coated balloons and paclitaxel eluting stents mete out a more favorable benefit risk profile The FDA has also asked the clinicians to determine whether the benefits of using a paclitaxel coated device  in patients at particularly high risk for restenosis and repeat femoropopliteal interventions  outweigh the risks of late mortality MedTech Makers  RejoinderMedical device major Boston Scientific Corp  is pleased about the FDA s recommendation as this will allow physicians to continue accessing the company s Eluvia Drug Eluting Vascular Stent  DES  System  Per Boston Scientific  Eluvia has already demonstrated an excellent safety profile and a very low revascularization rate of 12 9  at two years in the pivotal IMPERIAL trial including many complex PAD patients Medtronic too is optimistic about the FDA s guidance  which it claimed has fueled the company s growth in the PAD treatment market  According to the company  its IN PACT Admiral drug coated balloons  DCB  have clear benefited the clinical outcomes and improved the quality of life across multiple randomized controlled clinical trials  Per the IN PACT SFA trial result  three of the four DCB patients remained intervention free through five years  While those requiring a repeat procedure  the time to reintervention was more than two years However  as a major setback  Becton Dickinson   Co  has announced that post the FDA Advisory Committee meeting on paclitaxel  the regulatory agency has notified that it is not going to grant any PMA  Premarket Approval to the company s

122517,344032,BDX,Will Becton Dickinson  BDX  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Becton Dickinson  NYSE BDX   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This medical device manufacturer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 0 88  
For the most recent quarter  Becton Dickinson was expected to post earnings of  3 05 per share  but it reported  3 08 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 98   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 57 per share  while it actually produced  2 59 per share  a surprise of 0 78  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Becton Dickinson  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Becton Dickinson currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 61   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 5  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-becton-dickinson-bdx-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200475161,200475161
122529,344044,BDX,Becton Dickinson to buy CareFusion for  12 billion in cash  stock,news,"By Deena Beasley  Reuters    Medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson   Co  N BDX  has agreed to buy CareFusion Corp  N CFN   a maker of infusion pumps and other medical devices  for  12 2 billion in cash and stock  marking the latest multibillion dollar healthcare sector deal 
Becton said on Sunday it would pay a total of  58 00 a share    49 00 in cash and 0 0777 of a share of Becton Dickinson   for each share of CareFusion  This would represent a premium of 26 percent to the closing price on Oct  3 
The acquisition  recommended by the boards of both companies  would aim to combine the two U S  based companies  complementary products for preparing  administering and monitoring medications and would also extend the companies  geographic reach 
Becton Dickinson makes products to deliver and administer drugs  like disposable needles  syringes and intravenous catheters  while CareFusion makes products to store the drugs and to deliver them  such as infusion pumps 
 The combined entity will offer a  one stop shop  solution for hospitals  which are looking for sourcing efficiencies as they navigate a tough healthcare environment   ISI Group analyst Vijay Kumar said in a research note  He said the new company will be a market leader in the  20 billion medication management segment 
A combined company  could improve patient safety plus reduce costs at the same time   said Vincent Forlenza  Becton Dickinson s chairman  chief executive officer and president in a telephone interview 
Cost related healthcare reforms  including those mandated under President Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act  have spurred consolidation for U S  health systems and hospitals  the main customer for suppliers of medical equipment 
 This is an industry that from a customer perspective is consolidating   said Kieran Gallahue  CareFusion s chairman and CEO   Healthcare systems around the globe are looking for companies that can bring greater scale to them   it is a way to drive down costs while improving safety  
Forlenza said Becton s geographic reach   around 60 percent of its sales are outside of the United States and 25 percent of sales are in emerging markets   offers a strong platform for products from CareFusion  which currently relies on the domestic market for 75 percent of its revenue 
Becton said the transaction is expected to provide double digit earnings growth  on an adjusted basis  in the first full year  and will be accretive to net earnings in fiscal year 2018 
Kumar estimated that in its first year  the deal would increase Becton s cash earnings per share by 15 percent  On a  fully synergized  basis  he expects the deal to be 40 percent accretive to cash EPS 
Healthcare companies have been merging at a record pace  with year to date activity topping  346 billion  compared to  212 billion in the year ago period  Thomson Reuters data showed as of September 
Medical device maker Medtronic Inc s  N MDT  planned acquisition of Covidien Plc  N COV  for  43 billion is another recent deal aimed at increasing supplier leverage in negotiating sales to hospitals 
Other recent large deals in the healthcare sector have included AbbVie Inc s  N ABBV  planned  54 billion acquisition of Shire Plc  L SHP   AstraZeneca Plc  L AZN  fended off a  118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer Inc  N PFE  
Each of those transactions involved so called  tax inversion  in which U S  companies look to avoid high taxes by acquiring overseas assets and reincorporating in countries with lower tax rates  In reaction  the U S  government last month took measures aimed at limiting the benefits of redomiciling overseas 
The Becton CareFusion deal is not a tax inversion   CareFusion is based in San Diego  while Becton is headquartered in Franklin Lakes  New Jersey 
The deal  subject to regulatory and CareFusion shareholder approvals and customary closing conditions  is expected to close in the first half of next year 
At closing  the companies said Becton Dickinson shareholders will own around 92 percent of the combined company and CareFusion shareholders will own around 8 percent

Top Stock Reports for Eli Lilly  Altria and Becton  Dickinson
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Eli Lilly  Altria and Becton  Dickinson  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rankedEli Lily s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date  gaining  10  vs   1 9   The Zacks analyst thinks Lilly s revenue growth in 2019 will likely be driven by higher demand for its newer drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio as well as new migraine drug  Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis face generic competition 
In 2018  Lilly made significant pipeline progress with several positive late stage data readouts  multiple approvals and regulatory submissions  Emgality could emerge as a significant contributor to long term growth  Lilly has also added promising new pipeline assets through business development deals 
However  generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line  Estimates have gone up ahead of Q1 results  Lilly has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters 
Shares of Altria have underperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past three months   12 7  vs   19 8    The Zacks analyst thinks the company has been steadily gaining from the popularity of Smokeless products  To further bolster this category  the company recently invested in JUUL and Cronos  Altria has also applied for converting its non voting interests in JUUL to voting securities 
Pricing also continues to drive the company s revenues  It has also undertaken cost reduction initiatives to counter interest burden  Altria plans to deliver annualized cost savings of nearly  575 million by the end of 2019  However  the company grapples with persistently declining cigarette shipment volumes  Stern FDA regulations combined with increased health consciousness are taking a toll on the cigarette category 
Going forward  management expects cigarette industry volume to decline in the range of 3 5 5   Further  the company s wine category has been sluggish  thanks to stiff competition 
Becton  Dickinson s shares have outperformed the Zacks Dental Supplies industry over the past year  gaining  12 5  vs   1 5   The Zacks analyst likes the solid performance by the core BD Medical and Life Sciences units  Domestic and international revenues increased year over year in recent times 
Management is optimistic about the C R  Bard buyout which has consistently proven to be accretive  Notably  a series of product launches and regulatory approvals in recent times continue to boost the stock  The company has kept its fiscal 2019 guidance intact 
On the flip side  contraction in gross and operating margins in recent times is worrisome  Customer ordering patterns are also expected to negatively impact fiscal second quarter results  Management expects unfavorable foreign currency to remain headwinds in fiscal 2019  Stiff price competition in the MedTech space adds to its woes 
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include T Mobile and General Motors

The company generates maximum revenues from Cardiovascular  Sales from its subsegments   Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions   were  603 million  up 5  year over year at CER  and  273 million  up 7    respectively  during the second quarter

Guidance
Boston Scientific has provided an update to its full year 2017 guidance 
The company raised its 2017 revenue guidance to the range of  8 89  8 99 billion  annualized growth of 6 7  on reported basis and growth of 6 8  on operational basis including contribution of approximately 120 bps from EndoChoice and Symetis  from the earlier band of  8 80  8 90 billion  annualized growth of 5 6  on reported basis and growth of 6 7  on operational basis   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is  8 87 billion  below the guided range

Our Take
Even amid challenging economic conditions  a competitive environment and severe currency headwinds  Boston Scientific posted a better than expected second quarter  with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues  ahead of the mark  While foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose challenges  we are concerned with the company s recent recall of one of its prime products  Lotus range of heart devices  Also the unimpressive defibrillator performance within the company s core CRM segment continues to remain a drag for the overall growth 
Nevertheless  Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets  which accounted for higher sales across all its geographies in the second quarter  We are also encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products  both in the domestic and overseas markets 
Among the recent developments  worth mentioning is the company s recent acquisition of Switzerland based Symetis SA  in a bid to fortify its structural heart business in Europe  This apart  the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator  ICD  and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator  CRT D  systems  It also received CE Mark for the Vercise Gevia Deep Brain Stimulation  DBS  System and the first MR conditional directional DBS system for treatment of movement disorder symptoms in patients with Parkinson s disease  dystonia and essential tremor

they re reported with our  A Sneak Peek at Both StocksSimilar to the sequentially last quarter  Edwards Lifesciences seems to be gaining from its strong Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy  THVT  segment  Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographical regions with notable strength in the United States  the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well as a continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last quarter  Also  with the receipt of an expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June  the top line at the THVT segment is expected to get a further boost this yet to be reported quarter   Read   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of  496 million reflects an increase of 20 9  from the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves  THV  sales in the United

on Oct 26  before the market opens Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Looking into C R  Bard s recent performance trend  we believe that the growing adoption of the company s flagship Lutonix drug coated balloon  DCB  will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the soon to be reported quarter  Within the Endovascular business  peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by an accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the United States  We expect this product to significantly contribute to the company s top line in this quarter   Read   Notably  the company s

reported figure  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s revenues is pegged at  992 million for the yet to be reported quarter as compared to the year ago reported figure of  932 million  reflecting a 6 4  gain In this regard  we note that C R  Bard is slated to be acquired by Becton  Dickinson and Company   NYSE BDX   for  24 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017  This acquisition is expected to strengthen the company s footprint in the home healthcare market in the United States C R  Bard  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Comparative AnalysisAnalyzing all the revenue drivers and other fundamental factors for both Edwards Lifesciences and C R  Bard along with their respective Zacks Consensus Estimates  we may conclude that Edwards Lifesciences is expected to perform better

122973,344488,BDX,Align Technology  ALGN  Q2 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,We expect Align Technology  Inc    NASDAQ ALGN   to beat expectations when it reports second quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27  after market close Last quarter  the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 26 87   It is worth noting that Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 19 89   Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP   Align Technology has an  of  1 37  as the Most Accurate estimate is at 74 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 73 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Align Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions The combination of Align Technology s Zacks Rank  2 and  1 37  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat What s Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings We are upbeat about Align Technology s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion  thereby ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients  In this context  the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA  region as well as Brazil in Feb 2017  This is likely to drive the company s results in the to be reported quarter In May  the company announced the receipt of two U S  patents for Align s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment  Moreover  in a bid to gain traction in the Invisalign platform  Align collaborated with Digital Smile Design in March  Post collaboration  Align s Invisalign clear aligner treatment can be used by dentists during tooth alignment procedures along with Smile Design protocols Align Technology  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Notably  to expand its Invisalign brand offerings  Align Technology introduced a patient friendly solution   Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement   for teens in March  According to the company  this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet to be reported quarter  Recently  the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners  In this context  Align collaborated with exocad GmbH in March  whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high tech workflow solution for efficient scanning  design and manufacturing of in house dental prosthesis  In February  the company had announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio Moreover  the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America  thereby driving Invisalign utilization  Management expects this bullish trend to likely continue in the yet to be reported quarter Notably  for second quarter 2017  the company projects earnings per share of 71 74 cents on revenues of  340  345 million  The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 221 000 to 224 000  up 25 27  from a year ago On the flip side  unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company s revenues in the to be reported quarter  Also  the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations  higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in

123047,344562,BDX,6 Dividend Growth Stocks To Trump Rising Yield,opinion,"Dividend stocks lost some of their shine due to rising yields after Republican Donald Trump was elected as the new president  Yet  investors are still adding some of these to their portfolio  In particular  stocks with a strong history of dividend hike year over year are enjoying a solid run Why Growth Focused DividendsStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pays high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation irrespective of the stock market direction  This is because these stocks generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely  which makes the portfolio safer Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broad stock market or any other dividend paying stock Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies to sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Median   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Zacks Rank Less than 3  Stocks

123109,344624,BDX,3 Medical Devices Stocks Set To Beat This Earnings Season,opinion,"As of the end of last week  310 S P 500 members have reported their Q1 results  representing 85 3  of the sector s total market capitalization on the index  While to our great disappointment  we have seen that total earnings for these index members are down  7 2  year over year on  2 4  lower revenues  here is some real good news for investors keen on the Medical sector 
So far  more than 60  of the Medical sector index members have released their first quarter financial numbers  out of which 78 1  have reported better than expected earnings performance on revenue beat of 68 8   Accordingly  earnings were up 6 3  year over year on an 11 8  revenue growth rate 
While the global economic hullabaloo has been seen to hit the economy hard  leaving the conventional heavyweights like Finance  Tech  aerospace or oil energy in a position to pull the industry wide average expectation down  this stupendous first quarter performance by the Medical sector is something investors definitely need to muse on Beaming Medical Device Space
In fact  if we eliminate major drug and biotech stocks from Medical  which are currently entwined in pricing and prescription drug affordability related issues  this space confined mostly by medical device stocks indeed lends a lot of optimism  A recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview claims that the medical device space is positioned for impressive growth in the near term  At a glance  worldwide  medical device sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1  to  477 5 billion by 2020 
Needless to say that the factors like the recent exemption of the Medical Device Excise tax for the next two years came in as a much needed breather for these Medical device stocks  This dreadful tax  which was commonly referred to as  fund of the Affordable Care Act  ACA    simply took a toll on the entire medical device industry  since its enactment in 2013 
Data published in a report in FierceMedical Device stated that in 2014  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  made a payment of  180 million in medical device tax payments  while Medtronic  NYSE MDT   legacy Covidien and Smith   Nephew  LON SN   SNN  paid  112 million   60 million and  25 million  respectively 
We believe this exemption  albeit temporary  has boosted the positive sentiment in the medical device investment world  as most analysts believe it to be adequate for companies to address pressing issues such as a lack of opportunity for research and development  innovation  pipeline development  and to make investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products 
Apart from that  the strong product cycle and consistent innovation across different markets have continued to remain the major growth drivers in the medical device subsector Making the Right Choice
With a wide number of stocks in the medical device sector that almost always muddle up one s stock picking prowess  the Zacks methodology could offer some relief  One can narrow down choices by focusing on stocks that sport the desirable combination of a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  
Going by this criterion  we hereby present three medical device stocks that are poised to beat estimates this quarter Becton  Dickinson and Company    NYSE BDX   
Popularly known as BD  this global medical technology company has an innovative product pipeline  which is a key catalyst in our view  A set of FDA approvals in the last quarter has added products like TotalysMultiProcessor and TotalysSlidePrep instruments  FACSPresto system and FACSPresto CD4 Hb Cartridge and Vacutainer UltraTouch Push Button Blood Collection Set to the company s ever expanding product portfolio 
Meanwhile  BD s expansion into overseas markets  particularly the emerging markets  is a major positive  Moreover  the CareFusion  NYSE CFN  merger has opened up significant growth opportunities for the company  Further  the combined manufacturing footprint and operations  along with lower overhead expenses should result in significant cost savings 
BD will report its second quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 5  The stock boasts an Earnings ESP of  1 99   coupled with a Zacks Rank  2 Cardica Inc     NASDAQ CRDC

123112,344627,BDX,5 Stocks We Like,opinion,"A small measure of stability has returned to markets early this week after a ferocious bout of volatility that wiped  3 trillion from the world s balance sheets in the worst two day sell off of all time 
Many investors are understandably nervous about what s next 
I m here to tell you  Don t be 
Chances are  the Brexit is probably not the first financial temper tantrum you ve lived through  nor will it be the last  Getting all worked up about it just isn t worth the aggravation 
Today we re going to talk about why  and what you need to do to build up a profit positioning reflex that the world s most successful investors regard as second nature 
It s deceptively simple  elegant  and easy to execute  What s more  once you ve built up the reflex I m going to talk about today  you ll know how to immediately position yourself for profits the next time markets pitch a fit 
And  you ll have a huge advantage over other investors 
 Euro Shrink  Will Bring Tremendous Profits
I ve been intimately involved with the markets now for 35 years as a trader  a consultant  and an analyst  and stuff like the Brexit comes and goes more often than any of us would care to admit  The Internet and 24 hour news cycle we live with today just makes it seem worse 
For example  I vividly recall Black Monday in 1987   my first major crash  It  too  was unprecedented  and in the pre Internet days the news headlines were going bananas  Cell phones were in their infancy and smartphones were just a pipe dream  People were forced to wait for the breaking headlines  which meant they actually had time to think 
That was followed shortly by the U S  Savings   Loan Crisis in 1989  the Asian currency contagion in 1998  the dot bomb crash of 2000  the terrorist attacks of 2001  and ultimately  the Lehman Brothers blowout of 2008 
There is no doubt in my mind that we re going to see more  exits    every one of which will be held up in the media as a sensational event  unlike anything we ve ever seen before  
Somewhat tongue in cheek  here s what I think we re dealing with 
There will be more  a Frexit  France leaving   a Spexit  Spain leaving   a Nexit  the Netherlands leaving  
Other headline worthy possibilities include a Departugal  Italeave  Fruckoff  Czechout  Oustria  Finish  Slovlong  Latervia  Byegium  It s Spainreal 
At the end of the day  the European Union  EU  could shrink all the way to  Ditchland  
I am not trying to ruin your day here 
What I want you to come to terms with is the flawed notion that a crisis like the Brexit is a  one and done  event  That s na ve at best  and wishful thinking at worst 
Since we ve been investing together  I ve helped you identify fabulous opportunities that have led to spectacular performance and thrashed the markets  Examples include Becton Dickinson and Company  NYSE BDX   American Water Works  NYSE AWK  and Altria Group  NYSE MO   These  must have  investments have beaten the markets over time by as much as 44 to 1 
I ve also helped you aggressively hunt down the weakest companies  like Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK   Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and GoPro  NASDAQ GPRO   often at times when Wall Street was enamored with them  They ve produced double digit profits for everybody who s following along  as I hope you are 
To be clear  I am not telling you this to brag  I make my share of mistakes  too 
What I want you to understand is that there s always opportunity   and the Total Wealth Principles  Tactics  and approach will help you find them when other investors cannot and the headlines make doing so seem impossible 
Capturing profits during challenging times doesn t start with analysis or even data  It starts with the person who looks back at you in the mirror every morning 
Just like riding a bike or learning to cook a five star meal  you have to build up the reflexes needed to handle an event like the Brexit profitably 
Let me explain 
Five Terrific Companies to Buy Right Now
The overwhelming majority of investors run for the hills when the markets go haywire  which is why their portfolios are a fraction of what they could be  and why they repeatedly miss out on the enormous gains they so desperately want 
But the best investors and the most consistently profitable players have a very different take  Many run straight into the fire knowing full well that they ve got the advantage   not to mention plenty of profit potential 
They re net buyers  and I want you to be one of  em 
You don t have to bet the farm or even make a major purchase  Even a single share of something will do 
My goal is to help you build up the reflex needed to capitalize on chaos  and the mental strength that will allow you to view every major market event as an opportunity  not an excuse to bury your head in the sand 
And that comes from doing  just like riding a bike 
A single of share of Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   for example  would have set you back  663 on Monday if you swooped in when it hit rock bottom  It s trading at  687 as I write this 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  dropped all the way to  108 23  It s at  114 at the moment  and climbing 
If that kind of volatility isn t your thing  consider some of the more defensive plays we ve talked about this year   names like Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN   Altria Group  and American Water Works Co 
They didn t drop all that much because they re attracting capital  so there s implied stability and profit potential to boot 
Now  I ve talked to tens of thousands of investors over the years  and many think that they re going to outsmart the markets by waiting for a pullback  when the recovery starts  
That s wishful thinking 
The pullbacks they re longing for no longer exist  Approximately 70  of today s trading volume is driven by computers  which means price movement is more like a dogpile  If you re not in when it starts  you miss 80  of the move  perhaps more 
Case in point  March 2009 
Lots of investors sold out in a panic as the S P 500 and the Dow collapsed  They felt great because they  got out of the way  or  didn t try to catch a falling knife    comments I heard repeatedly during presentations around the world  and that were echoed in a blizzard of email 
That didn t last very long though 
The markets reversed  the bulls went on a rampage  and the vast majority of those very same people were left on the sidelines and completely missed out on the 211 19  run in the S P 500 into July 2015  the 302 68  run in the Nasdaq  and the 172 92  run in the Dow over the same time frame 
Here s the thing 
Many investors fantasize about really big returns  but very few actually have the reflexes needed to achieve that   which is why we re having this discussion today 
They like to think it s the headlines  or the economy  or China  or any of half a dozen other scary things that s caused them to lose out 
But that s not the case 
They re simply missing the reflex they need to overcome their fears 
To be clear  I am not saying that you need to buy indiscriminately every time the markets falter  There are going to be times when the stuff simply hits the proverbial fan  But even that doesn t change the reflexive behavior we re talking about today 
Learn to overcome your fears for a darn good reason 
 because doing so can help you be far more profitable ",2016-07-01,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-best-stocks-in-the-world-are-on-sale-now-–-we-like-these-five-200139490,200139490
123135,344650,BDX,Where We ll Find the Biggest Potential Profits Of 2016,opinion,"In my 2015 forecast  I predicted that defense  natural resources  and medical device companies would be the big stories of the year  despite volatility that was going to give most investors fits 
Sure enough  Raytheon Company  N RTN  has taken off as the war against ISIS intensifies  Returns are now 214 66  and counting  American Water Works  N AWK  has logged an impressive 112 66   and Becton Dickinson and Company  N BDX  is rocking 124 62  to date  Bear in mind  these gains come despite the Dow and S P 500 being modestly down for the year 
I also urged you to avoid or short companies that didn t have the quality we know leads to bigger profits and more stable income  like Twitter  N TWTR  and GoPro Inc  O GPRO   Those shorts have produced returns of 36  and 71  to date 
As exciting as those numbers are  2016 could be even better 
The Bull Market Lives On  for Us
The Fed continues to fly by the seat of its pants using badly flawed economic models with no bearing on reality  Europe s already challenging fiscal situation is being compounded by an unprecedented migration from the Middle East  China s slowing down  and Japan fell into its fourth recession in five years  only to have the numbers revised away a month later  Nationalism is on the rise worldwide  as is protectionism 
So the investing backdrop is challenging  to say the least 
But some of our favorite companies continue to pull ahead  We saw a 30  performance gap between the best and worst segments of the S P 500 in 2015  and I see that becoming even more graphic this year  If projections hold   growth may average 8  in 2016 
The run could last another three years  although not all in a straight line  Since 1926  economic recoveries have lasted an average of 58 months  so you could argue that the current expansion is past its prime at 78 months  However  three recoveries since 1981 have gone on for an average of 95 months  according to Kiplinger  Central bank meddling  wrong though it is  has that positive side 
Investors remain more interested in buying than selling  During the run up following last August s flash crash  for example  volume was 5 1 in favor of buying several days running  According to InvestTech CEO James Stack  stocks tend to rise an average of 24  over the following 12 months when we see that happen 
Further  we d still have to go another 36 months to match the nine year bull market that started in October 1990 and produced returns of 546  
Smart Risks and Good Companies Will Beat Beat Bad Markets
Overweighting U S  based large cap stocks that provide products and services with the pricing power will be necessary to overcome more central bank meddling and increasingly challenging global protectionism 
Fuel for growth  technology enabled opportunities  and allocation will be key   they re all in industries where revenue is rising and  are stable or increasing 
The synchronized recovery central bankers and politicians have tried to engineer will  unfortunately  remain a fantasy  Recovery  reform  and resurrection will be worldwide buzzwords 
Despite runaway debt and resulting stagnant growth  America s still the global economic leader  The BRICS are B U S T E D but  at a 50  discount to U S  stocks  chances are we ll be doing some shopping there in the next 12 months 
Prepare to Capitalize on Volatility

Bonds remain relevant  for now  Yellen has already begun one of the slowest rate hike cycles in history  This leaves the cost of capital low  the dollar strong  and energy cheap  Tax advantaged munis and government paper will benefit in 2016 
Gold prices will remain trapped in a tightly defined range of  900 to  1 100 for much of the year depending on how the Fed handles additional rate hikes  That s good because it will give investors an entry point to hedge their bond portfolios before the real run starts 
Other themes we ll follow closely in 2016 include 
Digital protection  Thieves have stolen more than 200 million charge accounts and personal information in the past 24 months  They will steal more 
The  War on Success  continues unabated  Taxes will rise  as will the real cost of everything  Our politicians  as usual  will be clueless to the consequences 
Startups will have to prove it or lose it  FOMO   the fear of missing out   will be replaced by NLYA   not losing your asteroids   on the next round of  
Productivity growth remains slower than expected  Pessimists will call for more stimulus  not knowing that makes matters worse  Still  they ll probably get it since no politician wants to fail on his or her watch 
China will not collapse  but the slowdown will change global business in two ways  First  companies that overextended in China will collapse  and there will be a sharp rise in defaults  Second  there will be a fresh round of investment into China by Western companies doubling down 
Nowcasting  The practice of combining current data with forecasting will come into its own  speeding up corporate decision making and profit taking 
Human augmentation  We re less than five years away from the earliest human machine interfaces  and we re tracking emerging human augmentation companies more closely than ever 
Protracted low prices are wreaking havoc on overleveraged energy companies  leading the strongest to make exciting new investments  in each other  That will translate to strong growth when prices stabilize  and sooner than most expect 
In closing  never forget that there s always a bull market somewhere  My job is to help you find it  together

123136,344651,BDX,BDX  Excellent Candidate For Long Term Dividend Growth,opinion,"Becton  Dickinson and Company  N BDX  is a world leader in medication management and patient safety solutions  The company has been in operation for more than 115 years and has increased its dividend for 44 consecutive years 
With a diverse portfolio of medical products  meaningful exposure to emerging markets and a large acquisition under its belt  BDX appears to be an excellent candidate for long term dividend growth investors to consider 
Business OverviewBDX was founded in 1897 and manufactures a wide range of medical supplies  devices  lab equipment  and diagnostics products  Some of its key products include syringes  needles  dispensing systems  and catheters  but its portfolio is well diversified  Many products help hospitals deliver medicines to patients  Customers include hospitals  clinics  physicians  offices  pharmacies  labs  blood banks  and others 
By geography  the majority of BDX s sales are from outside of the U S   and the company generates around 25  of its total sales from emerging markets 
Business AnalysisBDX acquired CareFusion  N CFN  for  12 2 billion in March 2015  Analyzing this deal  which was 20 times larger than any acquisition BDX had ever made  will highlight some of the strengths of BDX s business model 
CareFusion is a provider of medical devices and diagnostic products to hospitals and physicians  This deal essentially doubled the addressable market opportunity that BDX s medical segment had from  8 billion to  16 billion 
BDX s extensive distribution channels  which reach all over the world  were a major driver behind the acquisition  CareFusion s complementary products can be plugged into BDX s existing channels to reach international markets it had never been in before  60  of BDX s sales are abroad  but 75  of CareFusion s business is in the U S   
As seen below  BDX will now be able to offer integrated medication management solutions and smart devices   from drug preparation and pharmacy to dispensing on the hospital floor  administration to the patient  and subsequent monitoring 
Source  BDX Investor Presentation
As hospitals increasingly look to cut costs and improve quality  we believe medical device suppliers will likely continue consolidating  With CareFusion under its belt  BDX should be able to better help hospitals manage their drug use and cut down on their waste for several reasons 
First  many of their products are complementary and will allow hospitals to save money by only purchasing from one supplier instead of several  For example  CareFusion manufactures equipment that pumps drugs into the catheters that are currently sold by BDX and put drugs into patients 
Additionally  CareFusion provides BDX with software that helps hospitals track drug usage and the machines they use to store medicines and fill orders  These offerings will become increasingly important as hospitals focus on becoming more efficient 
Other competitors lack the breadth and depth of BDX s portfolio and seem increasingly likely to get squeezed out by the larger players  BDX s brand recognition  distribution reach  and economies of scale serve as additional advantages in its markets 
Beyond its comprehensive product portfolio and distribution channels  BDX spends over  600 million on R D and has built up an arsenal of patents  The healthcare industry also operates under numerous regulations in every country  further raising barriers to entry Key RisksSimilar to our analysis of dividend aristocrat Medtronic  N MDT   BDX must comply with a variety of healthcare regulations  which could result in pricing pressure  lower reimbursement rates for some of its products  and other unexpected headwinds  For example  part of the Affordable Care Act  which was enacted in March 2010  enacted a 2 3  excise tax on U S  sales of certain medical devices 
On the flipside  at least in the U S   healthcare reform is helping more Americans gain health insurance coverage  increasing the number of needles  syringes  and other medical supplies consumed 
Outside if regulatory risk and currency headwinds  the company will have its hands full integrating CareFusion and extracting its expected synergies over the next few years  Given the size of this deal  especially compared to BDX s historical acquisitions  execution needs to be strong 
All things considered  BDX s diversified portfolio  recession resistant products  strong business model  long operating history  and disciplined management team increase the company s durability Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
BDX s dividend Safety Score of 88 is excellent  Over the last four quarters  BDX s dividend has consumed 45  of the company s free cash flow  providing plenty of cushion and room for future growth 
Looking longer term  we can see that BDX s payout ratios have largely remained between 25  and 40   the 2015 spike in its EPS payout ratio is due to noisy accounting charges and isn t significant   Such a stable ratio shows that BDX has done a great job of consistently growing its earnings to fuel its dividend growth and has been consistently profitable Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Evaluating BDX s performance during the recession can help us understand how resilience of its business  Many healthcare related products tend to be more recession resistant because sick and injured people still need to be taken care of regardless of economic conditions  As seen below  BDX s sales actually grew each year  and its stock outperformed the S P 500 by 20  in 2008 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The company has also generated a return on invested capital in the mid teens over the last decade  indicating that the company has an economic moat and has a stable business model Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Free cash flow generation is also very important to evaluate when it comes to evaluating the safety of a company s dividend  Businesses that fail to generate free cash flow must rely on debt and equity markets to keep paying their dividend and are often of lower quality 
BDX has generated positive and growing free cash flow in each of its last 10 years of business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  analyzing the balance sheet is important because companies with high amounts of debt could find themselves in a crunch if business trends deteriorate and they must make interest and debt payments  They will always pay credit holders before issuing a dividend 
BDX s balance sheet was stretched to finance the company s acquisition of CareFusion  but management is focused on paying down debt over the next several years  Given the company s consistent free cash flow generation  we aren t concerned by the temporarily higher debt load  Importantly  there is plenty of cash flow to comfortably cover a larger interest expense and the dividend  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
All things considered  BDX s dividend is extremely safe  With a long operating history  a diversified portfolio of recession resistant products  and strong brand recognition  BDX is a high quality blue chip dividend stock Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
BDX achieved an excellent dividend Growth Score of 79  which means that it has some of the strongest dividend growth potential in the market  The company s favorable rating is driven by its low payout ratios  strong earnings growth  and consistent cash flow generation 
BDX has increased its dividend for 44 consecutive years  firmly securing its spot on the list of dividend aristocrats  The company has consistently increased its dividend at a 10  annual rate over the last decade and most recently raised its dividend by 10  earlier this month 
Assuming BDX meets expectations for continued 10   earnings growth  we expect the dividend to continue growing at a similar rate Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationBDX trades at 17 6x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 1 8   which is lower than its five year average dividend yield of 2 0  
BDX s management team expects the company s sales and earnings to grow 4 5  and 10   per year  respectively  In other words  the stock appears to offer double digit total return potential if all goes as planned 
BDX appears to be an excellent business trading at a reasonable price  However  its low dividend yield makes it more appealing for very long term dividend growth investors ConclusionBDX is an excellent medical technology company  Its acquisition of CareFusion appears to offer numerous long term growth opportunities as the healthcare landscape continues evolving and international markets spend more on healthcare 
The company s dividend is extremely safe with excellent growth prospects as well  If the company can deliver on management s double digit earnings growth goal  the stock looks attractively priced at less than 18x forward earnings estimates

123144,344659,BDX,Will Thermo Fisher  TMO  Exceed Q1 Earnings Expectations ,opinion,"We expect Massachusetts based medical instruments manufacturer  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc    NYSE TMO   to beat expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Apr 28  Last quarter  the company had reported a positive earnings surprise of 47   Also  the four quarter trailing average beat is pegged at 1 41   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Thermo Fisher is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  Thermo Fisher s  is  0 58   since the Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 75 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 74  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  
Zacks Rank  Thermo Fisher currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Thermo Fisher s Zacks Rank  3 and  0 58  ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat 
What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
After a solid 2015  Thermo Fisher is looking forward to continue this momentum even in 2016  It is encouraging to note that with about 4  expected organic growth for full year 2016  the company anticipates reporting 7  growth in the first quarter 
As in 2015  even in the first quarter of 2016  the company expects to see strong growth in the bioproduction and biosciences businesses  Strong productivity and incremental cost synergies are expected to further improve operational efficiencies down the line 
With respect to Life Technologies synergy  per the company  it is perfectly on track to deliver revenue and cost synergy targets  By the end of 2015  the company realized  130 million of incremental cost synergies  in line with its full year target  Revenue synergies at 2015 end were  90 million  much faster than anticipated  This puts Thermo Fisher in a comfortable position to achieve its full year 2016 targeted synergy to deliver  150 million in revenue  The company is also confident of its overall three year synergy target which has been raised from  300 million to  350 million 
Apart from the Life Technologies integration  we are also focusing on the company s emerging market growth strategies  The company expects to garner 25  of total revenue from the high growth Asia Pacific and emerging markets by 2016 from 19  in 2011  10  in 2006   Thermo Fisher s expanding presence in emerging markets will continue to be an important growth driver for the first quarter 
In this context  we need to mention the company s recent decision to buy Affymetrix Inc   AFFX  for  1 3 billion  Affymetrix  which works on multiplex and simultaneous analysis of biological systems at the cell  protein  and gene level  facilitating the transition of research tools into clinical and applied markets  is expected to boost Thermo Fisher s offering in the fast growing flow cytometry market through an advanced antibody portfolio  Although this impending acquisition  to close in second quarter 2016  will not have any impact on the company s first quarter performance  investor sentiment is picking up based on this news 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

123178,344693,BDX,Lackluster Earnings Reports Put Eager Bulls Back Into Waiting ,opinion,"Even with many of the global issues pushed off the front page  eager bulls found yet another reason to keep the troops in the barracks  The only newsworthy items are related to corporate earnings reports  which have been mixed at best  interspersed with the occasional spectacular report    primarily from mega caps like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   or Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Some of the bulls have taken their chips off the table until after Labor Day  while others have merely scaled back to scalping some trades  Either way  stocks appear destined to thrash about for the rest of the summer 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 

Market overview 

Earnings season is off and running  and yes  some of the reports have been startlingly strong  Beyond the blowout numbers from mega caps like Google  Facebook  and Amazon  we have heard the occasional terrific report from firms like Sabrient favorite Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   On the flip side  IBM  NYSE IBM   United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and Verizon  NYSE VZ  have disappointed  In any case  leadership has been narrowing  and market breadth is about the worst in the past 15 years 

Healthcare has been by far the best performing sector again this year  but Financials are starting to perk up  And looking forward  there is optimism that banks will do well in an environment of rising rates and a steepening yield curve 

Of course  given the strength of the US dollar  commodities across the board are in glut mode  with much weeping and gnashing of teeth in the Energy and Basic Materials sectors  Nevertheless  refiners of petroleum products are doing quite well  thank you  and enjoying strong operating margins  The  crack spread   i e   the difference between the cost paid for crude oil versus the price received for refined product has been very attractive  Sabrient favorites in the space include Tesoro  NYSE TSO   Valero Energy  NYSE VLO   and Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  

Other than earnings  the other big news story is China s stock market  which took a big  8  hit on Monday  its worst selloff in eight years  which led regulators to announce they will begin buying shares as a way to stabilize the market 

Of course  the Fed s plan for making their first move with the fed funds rate is still a matter of interest  but it is certainly unclear as to when that might occur  despite the Fed s desire to not surprise the markets with such actions   I myself have long thought it might not occur until next year  but recently I gave more credence to the possibility of a move this fall  The Fed seems to be signaling September  and most economists seem to think that s the highest likelihood  But according to ConvergEx  the CME Fed Funds futures is indicating lower than 50  likelihood until December  and in fact  inflation and GDP growth are both indicative of a fragile economy that the Fed is unlikely to want to burden 

Bill Gross recently said that the Fed needs to just go ahead and raise the fed funds rate essentially to prove that the economy doesn t really rely upon low rates to function  Hmmm  We shall see  And for his own part  Jeffrey Gundlach has predicted that a move won t occur this year  and moreover  he thinks that the 10 year Treasury yield will soon fall again toward the 2  level  Note that the 10 year yield closed Friday at 2 27   while the 30 year yield was at 2 97  

The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed last Friday at 13 74  but then on Monday it spiked above 16  which is back above the 15 fear threshold  but still well below the 20 panic threshold that has held as resistance through the summer  In fact  S P recently reported that with the exception of gold and oil  volatility is generally down across asset classes  and implied volatility in every equity market is below its 200 day simple moving average 

SPY chart review 

The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed last week at 208  but then fell on Monday to close at 206 79  where it is again probing historically solid support at the important 200 day simple moving average  As I suspected it would  the long standing uptrend line was easily recaptured  after a brief hesitation   but recent news events once again brought the bears out in enough force to push price down once again  In effect  SPY succumbed to a triple top formation as shown  and in fact the Russell 2000 small cap index actually displays a more ominous head and shoulders pattern   Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all pointed downward with more room to run to the downside  Major support is right here at current levels corresponding to the critical 200 day SMA  which is still rising bullishly  by the way   followed by earlier in year support at 205  then round number support at the 200 price level 



Latest sector rankings  

Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 

In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 

Outlook score is forward looking  while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 


Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 

1  Healthcare has returned to the top spot with an Outlook score of 82  primarily due to favorable sentiment among Wall Street analysts  net upward revisions to earnings estimates  and a market topping forward long term growth rate  However  its forward P E remains pricey  Financial takes second with a score of 78  primarily due to its low forward P E  Utilities falls to third place with a score of 72  followed by Technology and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   All five score above 60  and then there is a gap down to Industrial at 36 and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  at 35  Thus  we have a two tier ranking 

2  Energy remains at the bottom with an Outlook score of 5  while Telecom again takes the second spot in the bottom two with a 17  Both sectors score poorly in most factors of the GARP model across the board  although Telecom has enjoyed recent upgrades to earnings estimates 

3  Looking at the Bull scores  Healthcare  Financial  and Technology all share the top score of 59  Energy has the lowest Bull score of 48 and is the only one below 50  The top bottom spread has narrowed to only 11 points  reflecting high sector correlations on particularly strong market days  i e   broad risk on buying   It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 

4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the top score of 55  followed by Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   which means that stocks within these sectors have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Basic Materials scores the lowest at 39  The top bottom spread is 16 points  which reflects moderate sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 

5  Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed by Financial  while Energy is clearly the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  is the best  followed by Healthcare and Utilities  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Energy and Materials are the worst 

6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings continue to look mostly neutral  with Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  in the top five  well ahead of Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   Industrial  and Basic Materials  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 

Stock and ETF Ideas 

Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   now reflects a neutral bias and suggests holding Healthcare  Financial  and Utilities in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is below its 50 day but still above its 200 day simple moving average  

Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Healthcare  Financial  and Utilities sectors include iShares Global Healthcare ETF  NYSE IXJ   PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio  NYSE KBWB   and Guggenheim Invest S P 500 Equal Weight Utilities ETF  NYSE RYU  

For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Healthcare  Financial  and Utilities sectors include Becton  Dickinson   Co  NYSE BDX   Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   The Travelers Companies  NYSE TRV   SunTrust  NYSE STI   The AES Corp  NYSE AES   and Level 3 Communications  NYSE LVLT   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm 

If you prefer to play a bounce and maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Financial  and Technology  in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Healthcare  in that order 

IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but
