178237,399753,TJX,Target and TJX Companies to Benefit From Pier 1 s Closures,news,"Pier 1 Imports  NYSE PIR   known for its eclectic range of home furnishings and decorative items  recently announced the closure of 450 of its stores in order to right size its business in the face of decreasing revenues  The company faces challenges from increasing competition from discount stores and e commerce  In its recent fiscal third quarter  ended November 30  earnings report  the company announced double digit declines in both comparable sales and net sales 
While the home goods store works to close hundreds of stores  other retailers in the space could benefit from the closures  Research company Telsey Advisory Group wrote that Target  NYSE TGT  and The TJX Company s  NYSE TJX  HomeGoods stores are potential beneficiaries  as the two retailers have a high percentage of stores within three miles of a Pier 1 location  This means potential market share gains could boost the sales of Target and HomeGoods  Both retailers sell unique  well priced items for home  as Pier 1 is known for 

Target stands to gain market share
In mid January  Target announced holiday sales that were below expectations  with comparable sales in the November December period increasing 1 4   The weakness was due to the toy and electronics categories  Some analysts didn t see this announcement signaling anything wrong with the company s strategy  citing that this holiday season had six fewer shopping days than last year s  Target has had an impressive eight straight quarters of comparable sales growth of 3  or more 
Now Target stands to gain share in its home department from Pier 1 store closures  as 35  of Target stores are within three miles of a Pier 1  The big box store continues to have success with its home category  with low single digit comp growth in the latest fiscal third quarter  ended November 2  off very strong growth a year earlier  Much of this success results from the retailer s private brand strategy  From 2016 to 2018  Target launched 20 of its own brands  concentrated in the apparel and home divisions 
If Target receives additional customer traffic from people who used to shop Pier 1 for furnishings and decor  not only will Target s home department get a boost  but other categories could see additional sales  One of Target s strategies has been to draw traffic into stores with exclusive products  often collaborations with in demand designers like Marimekko and Lilly Pulitzer   then getting them to buy from other departments and view the store as a convenient  one stop shop   For example  75  of Target customers who visit with the intent to buy a non food item also up buying at least one food product  
The company trades at 17 times forward earnings  below the S P s 19 times and the consumer discretionary sector s 25 times   and is expected to have a 9  increase in earnings in 2021  Given Target s successful strategy with private label brands and impressive growth  shares are worth buying for those looking for exposure to the retail space 
TJX s HomeGoods and Homesense could also benefit
TJX is the parent company of popular home furnishings retailers HomeGoods and Homesense  which are known for affordable  eclectic products  These specialty stores have an opportunity to gain market share from the Pier 1 closures  helping boost future sales growth  59  of HomeGoods stores are within three miles of a Pier 1 store  according to Telsey Advisory Group 
In TJX s most recent earnings report  for the period ending September 30  2019   the company announced a consolidated comparable sales increase of 4   over a very strong 7  increase  in the prior year  The HomeGoods division s comparable sales increased 1  year over year  over a 7  increase last year 
CFO Scott Goldenberg commented that  customers love HomeGoods  and we are very confident in its enduring appeal for consumers and the fundamental strength of this division  
The additional business from former Pier 1 customers will further boost the success of both HomeGoods and complementary Homesense stores  which launched in the U S  in 2017  The company operated 807 HomeGoods stores and 32 Homesense stores in the U S  as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020  This is up from its 526 HomeGoods stores in January 2017  Executives see potential in the long term for about 1 000 HomeGoods and 400 Homesense stores in the U S

178249,399765,TJX,At shuttered Ohio plant  workers still hope for new GM vehicle,news,"By Nick Carey LORDSTOWN  Ohio  Reuters    When asked about reports General Motors Co  N GM  may turn its shuttered Lordstown  Ohio  plant into a battery factory   Buffalo  Joe Nero snorts and points at the vast complex that until six months ago made the Chevrolet Cruze   You can t support a plant like this making batteries  We need a new vehicle allocated to us   said Nero  62  who has worked at five plants over 42 years with the No  1 U S  automaker    It wouldn t even cover 10  of the facility or hire 10  of the people  and they wouldn t pay enough to support yourself  let alone a family   he said  The United Auto Workers  UAW  union  which went on strike last week  agrees   The sprawling Lordstown plant at one time employed more than 4 500 workers  GM s decision to close it and three other U S  facilities due to sagging U S  passenger car sales has drawn widespread criticism  including from President Donald Trump  Ohio is a crucial swing state in the 2020 presidential election  The closure is part of the reason for the UAW strike  to demand that GM build another vehicle there  The union also wants GM to reduce the use of temporary workers and share more of its profits  a decade after the union helped the company through a government led bankruptcy   Visiting nearby Youngstown soon after becoming president in 2017  Trump told workers that factory jobs would not leave  advising them   Don t move  don t sell your house   Since GM s announcement  Trump has urged the Detroit company to move vehicle production back to the United States from Mexico   As part of contract talks with the UAW  GM has suggested the Lordstown facility could be converted to an electric vehicle  EV  battery plant  Separately  it says it is also negotiating to sell the plant to a group affiliated with EV start up Workhorse Group Inc  O WKHS    A source familiar with GM s plans said if the sale goes ahead  the automaker would then build a new battery plant near the Lordstown facility  Workhorse declined to comment  In Washington in June  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra defended the Workhorse plan  She also told Reuters that GM had no intention of building a new vehicle in Lordstown  Lordstown workers say that s the only way there will be enough well paid manufacturing jobs for the community  They   and the UAW   place the blame squarely on GM   You did everything GM ever asked of you and it still wasn t enough   UAW Local 1112 president Tim O Hara told 100 cheering workers during a rally outside the plant on Friday   We re going to hold the line as long as it takes   The reality is that GM needs to cut back underutilized U S  manufacturing capacity even at current levels  said Sam Fiorani  a vice president with Auto Forecast Solutions   There s no chance that GM is going to put a product back into that plant   he said   They have too much capacity as it is   GM s capacity utilization rate in its North American plants is about 75 percent  excluding idled assembly plants in Lordstown and Detroit  research firm LMC Automotive said  THE LAST CRUZE  The 6 2 million sq foot  576 000 sq meters  Lordstown complex has manufactured more than 16 million vehicles since it opened in 1966  The last Cruze rolled off the line in March  Most workers here have taken transfers to other GM plants  But around 450 workers have not  many because they did not want to uproot their families  Even if the Workhorse deal goes through  workers wonder how many people the plant would employ  whether they would still be working for GM and what kind of pay cut that would entail  UAW workers at the top of the wage scale earn about  31 an hour  compared with the  15  17 an hour workers are paid at a GM battery plant near Detroit that operates under a side agreement  Analysts said neither a Workhorse nor a GM plant would be likely to employ even half the plant s previous workforce   Nothing other than vehicle production has even a hope of replacing the jobs and income and economic impact of what was previously there as an automotive assembly plant   said Kristin Dziczek  vice president of industry  labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research based in Ann Arbor  Michigan  The UAW said in a 2018 research paper that the disruptive effect of electric vehicles and their less complex batteries compared with gasoline powered engines meant that fewer workers were going to be needed in the future  Teresa Oakes  44  has done the math   If they made batteries here it would allow them to lower wages to the bare minimum   said Oakes  who worked at the plant for 10 years   GM should bring back vehicles they make in Mexico and have them made by U S  workers instead    Most other jobs in the Lordstown area pay less  including at warehouses like the one discount retailer TJX Companies Inc  N TJX  is building nearby  Rick Michaels  49  took a transfer to a plant in Lansing  Michigan  and travels 4 1 2 hours home every weekend to see his family  He was on the picket line at Lordstown all week   If GM opened a battery factory here  that would barely employ all the people here   Michaels said on Friday  pointing at the rally crowd   There would be no way for me to get back home   Doug Grant  59  was picketing in a homemade T shirt that read  DID YOU MAKE  21 905 256 IN 2017  on the front and  MARY BARRA DID   on the back  Grant  who said he declined to take a transfer to another GM facility  said it could take years to get a

Revenues are expected to be  10 31 billion  up 4 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TJX 
For TJX  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TJX will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that TJX would post earnings of  0 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 62  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
TJX doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tjx-tjx-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200484685,200484685

178286,399802,TJX,3 Recession Proof Stocks To Consider As Slowdown Fears Escalate,opinion,"Signs of an upcoming economic recession continue to build  Just yesterday  the U S  ISM manufacturing release showed the sector contracted in August  the first time this has happened in over three years  As well  underlying worries about a weakening economy  plus the U S  China trade war now entering its second year continue to weigh on markets and economic activity   
Meanwhile  the yield on the benchmark U S  10 year Treasury note keeps slipping and  since August  has repeatedly inverted below the 2 year rate a bond market phenomenon that has historically preceded recessions 
Still  even if a downturn were to occur  there are a wide range of stocks available to help boost your portfolio  In our view  the three names below present a buying opportunity should the U S  economy slide into a recession 
1  Dollar General  Recession Proof Discount Retailer
Shares of Dollar General  NYSE DG   the largest discount retailer in the U S   are up nearly 44  this year  The stock closed at  155 63 on Tuesday  within sight of an all time high of  158 90 touched on August 30  giving it a market cap of  40 billion 
The company s recession proof status makes sense  After all  when money becomes tight  consumers tend to look for thriftier priced shopping alternatives  a sweetspot for discount retailers 
Dollar General  which operates more than 15 000 stores in 44 states  mostly sells groceries  household supplies and personal care products at rock bottom prices  It has publicly described their core customers as households earning less than  35 000 
 





The Goodlettsville  Tenn  based chain posted surprisingly strong second quarter results on August 29  despite rising tariffs on goods it imports from China 
Dollar General reported earnings per share of  1 74  beating EPS expectations of  1 57  Sales in the quarter totaled  6 98 billion  up more than 8  from the same period a year earlier  and just ahead of forecasts for revenue of  6 89 billion 
Same store sales  a key metric in retail  which measures store by store sales performance  rose 4   surpassing expectations for a 2 5  gain 
The strong results prompted the retailer to raise its full year fiscal 2019 guidance  It now expects sales growth of 8   up from prior guidance of 7   and same store sales growth in the low to mid 3  range  compared to previous expectations of approximately 2 5  
2  Planet Fitness  Low Fee Health Club Chain  
As evidence starts to mount that the U S  economy is hitting a soft patch  Planet Fitness  NYSE PLNT  should also be on your radar  The fitness center operator  which offers  10 membership options  now has 14 million subscribers across 1 859 locations  making it one of the largest U S  fitness club franchises by number of members and locations 
Planet Fitness  membership based business  which is driven by low monthly fees  makes it one of the top recession proof names to consider  The company is also likely to benefit from its lack of exposure to China  which makes it less at risk from the U S  China trade war 
Shares of Planet Fitness  which have gained almost 25  since the start of 2019  ended at  67 08 last night  giving it a market cap of  6 18 billion 

The Hampton  New Hampshire based company easily beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines when it released earnings for its fiscal second quarter on August 6  Earnings per share totaled  0 45 in the quarter ended June 30  surpassing expectations for EPS of  0 41 and up from  0 34 in the same period a year earlier  Revenue surged 29 3  to  181 6 million  surpassing forecasts of  167 8 million   
The strong quarterly results were driven by an 8 8  jump in same store sales growth 
The company also boosted its full year earnings and sales outlook  It now expects earnings per share to jump 26  for the full year  while revenue is forecast to rise 18   up from prior guidance of a 25  increase in EPS and a 15  gain in sales 
3  TJX Companies  Off Price Retailer  
The final name to consider is another the retail sector denizen  Off price retailer TJX Companies  NYSE TJX   which owns T J  Maxx  Marshalls  and Home Goods brands  is likely to benefit from an economic downturn as consumers migrate to discount retailers as spending contracts 
The price conscious chain  which operates a total of 4 412 stores in nine countries  including the U S   Canada  the UK  Ireland  Germany  Austria  the Netherlands  Poland and Australia  offers a wide selection of well known designer brands at a deep discount  providing consumers with what management calls  a treasure hunt  shopping experience 
The stock  which settled at  54 28 last night  has gained nearly 21  in 2019  giving it a market cap of  65 5 billion 

The Framingham  Mass  based discount clothing and home decor chain reported second quarter earnings per share of  0 62 on August 20  matching expectations  Revenue climbed to  9 78 billion  up 5  from the  9 33 billion it brought in during the same period a year earlier 
Comparable sales rose 2   thanks to a ramp up in foot traffic at its T J  Maxx and Marmaxx branded stores  The company also enjoyed same store sales growth of 1  at its TJX Canada segment and 6  at TJX International 
 This quarter marks the 20th straight quarter of customer traffic increases at T J  Maxx and Marmaxx   CEO Ernie Herrman said in a statement   This speaks to the consistency and fundamental strength of our treasure hunt shopping experience through many types of retail and economic environments  ",2019-09-04,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-recessionproof-stocks-to-consider-as-slowdown-fears-escalate-200461222,200461222

178417,399933,TJX,TJX  TJX  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"TJX  TJX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This parent of T J  Maxx  Marshalls and other stores is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 5  
Revenues are expected to be  9 19 billion  up 5 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 18  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TJX 
For TJX  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 79  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that TJX will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that TJX would post earnings of  0 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  13 24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

178462,399978,TJX,U S  labor market flexes muscles as February payrolls soar,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employers stepped up hiring in February and the jobless rate fell to its lowest level since the spring before President Barack Obama took office  which could put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June 
Nonfarm payrolls increased 295 000 last month after rising 239 000 in January  the Labor Department said on Friday  The broad job gains came despite disruptive winter weather that took hold across large parts of the country in mid February 
The unemployment rate dropped two tenths of a percentage point to 5 5 percent  the lowest since May 2008  slipping into territory that some Fed officials consider consistent with full employment 
 The labor market is on a roll  This should ease fears at the Fed that the global downturn and sharp drop in oil prices are materially disrupting the U S  economic outlook  and keep the Fed firmly on course for a June lift off   said Scott Anderson  chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco 
U S  stocks and shorter dated government bonds fell sharply as traders brought forward bets on when the Fed would raise rates  The dollar hit an 11 1 2 year high against the euro  which has been under pressure since the European Central Bank announced a bond buying program to lower euro zone borrowing costs 
Last month s decline in the unemployment rate  however  largely reflected people dropping out of the labor force 
But economists  who had expected payrolls to rise only 240 000 and the unemployment rate to fall to 5 6 percent  noted that other indicators monitored by the U S  central bank showed a rapidly tightening labor market 
February marked the 12th straight month that employment gains have been above 200 000  the longest such run since 1994 
Average hourly earnings rose by three cents last month  leaving the year on year gain at 2 percent  That compared to a 2 2 percent rise seen in the 12 months through January 
While economists acknowledged that persistently sluggish wage growth and very benign inflation argued against the Fed pulling the trigger in June  they said tightening conditions in the labor market could force the central bank s hand 
A Reuters survey of 16 large banks conducted after the jobs report found that many economists expect a June rate hike 
 Even if the Fed decides to delay the lift off in policy  it is hard to see the downward trend in unemployment not continuing   said Jeremy Lawson  chief economist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh  Scotland 
 Will the Fed really want short term interest rates to be negative when the unemployment rate falls below 5 percent late this year or early next year  
WAGE VIGIL
Fed officials are monitoring pay data closely to help determine when enough pressure has built in the jobs market to merit higher borrowing costs to keep the economy from overheating 
The central bank has kept its key overnight lending rate near zero since December 2008 
Wage growth could get a lift from an announcement last month by Wal Mart  N WMT   the world s largest retailer  that it would spend more than  1 billion this year to increase wages for about 40 percent of its U S  workforce 
Other companies including TJX Cos Inc  N TJX  and health insurer Aetna  N AET  also have announced pay increases 
The closely followed employment report was released a little more than a week before the Fed s March 17 18 policy meeting  Many economists expect the central bank could signal its openness to a June rate hike by dropping a pledge to be  patient  in considering such a move 
 It is most likely they will drop  patience  in March   said Samuel Coffin  an economist at UBS in Stamford  Connecticut 
February s sturdy jobs report reinforces the view that a recent cooling in economic growth reflects temporary factors  such as harsh winter weather and a now settled labor dispute at West Coast ports 
That dispute weighed on exports and imports in January as the trade deficit narrowed by  3 8 billion to  41 8 billion  a separate report from the Commerce Department showed 
While the labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  fell one tenth of a percentage point to 62 8 percent last month  other measures on the Fed s so called dashboard improved 
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to its lowest level since September 2008 
The number of Americans unemployed for 27 weeks or longer also dropped to a six year low 
Overall  private payrolls increased 288 000 last month  with construction employment rising 29 000  Manufacturing payrolls were up 8 000 and government employment jumped 7 000 
There were hefty gains in retail payrolls  while employment in the leisure and hospitality sector recorded its largest increase since August 2012 

The mining sector saw an acceleration in job losses last month  with payrolls posting their biggest decline since August 2009  It was hurt by a loss of 1 100 jobs tied to oil and gas extraction  which has taken a hit from lower crude oil prices ",2015-03-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-labor-market-flexes-muscles-in-february-331220,331220

Investors will be hoping for strength from TJX as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 27  2019  On that day  TJX is projected to report earnings of  0 68 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 1 45   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  10 98 billion  up 0 2  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  2 45 per share and revenue of  38 83 billion  These totals would mark changes of  21 29  and  8 26   respectively  from last year

Looking at TJX s earnings history  the stock has closed higher or flat the day after the company reported in three of the last four quarters  including a 6 9  surge in February  after the company reported solid same store sales  Looking back eight quarters  the shares have moved 3 2  the day after earnings  on average  regardless of direction  This time around  however  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 5 6  move for Tuesday s trading

178533,400049,TJX,Can TJX  TJX  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering TJX  TJX   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry 
This parent of T J  Maxx  Marshalls and other stores has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11 11  
For the last reported quarter  TJX came out with earnings of  1 17 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 per share  representing a surprise of 11 43   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 02 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 13 per share  delivering a surprise of 10 78  
Price and EPS Surprise

For TJX  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
TJX currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 69   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 13  2018 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-tjx-tjx-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200354774,200354774
178534,400050,TJX,TJX  TJX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when TJX  TJX  reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 13  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This parent of T J  Maxx  Marshalls and other stores is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 21 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21  
Revenues are expected to be  9 47 billion  up 8 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 07  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TJX 
For TJX  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that TJX will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that TJX would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of  11 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
TJX appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tjx-tjx-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200355486,200355486

178768,400284,TJX,Straddles And Strangles For Earnings Season  ,opinion,"With earnings season in full swing  here s an options strategy that s perfect for a company about to report  
 

A straddle involves buying both a call and a put at the same strike price  at the money  at the same time  
 

With options  you buy a call if you expect the market to go up  And you buy a put if you expect the market to go down  
 

A straddle  however  is a strategy to use when you re not sure which way the market will go  but you believe something big will happen in either direction  
 

And earnings season is a great time to do this because very few things can send a stock soaring or plummeting like an EPS surprise  
 

For example  let s say a stock was trading at  100 a few days before their earnings announcement  So you decide to put on a straddle by buying  
 

  the  100 strike call
  and the  100 strike put 
 

Because you only plan on being in the trade for a few days  to maybe a few weeks   you decide to get into the soon to expire options  

Note  usually  I ll advocate buying more time and getting in the money options  And I still do    when playing one side of the market   

But when playing both sides of the market simultaneously for an event you expect to take place in the near immediacy  the opposite is best  Why  Because at expiration  your profit is the difference between how much your options are in the money minus what you paid for them  So if you don t need a lot of time  this keeps the cost down and your profit potential up   
 

If you paid  150 for an at the money call option that will expire shortly and another  150 for an at the money put option that will expire shortly  your cost to put on the trade was  300  not including transaction costs   
 

If that stock shot up  10 as a result of a positive earnings surprise  that call option that you paid  150 for would now be worth  1 000  And that put option would be worth zero   0   
 

So let s do the math  if the call  which is now  10 in the money  is worth  1 000  then subtract the  150 you paid  and that gives you an  850 profit on the call   
 

The put  on the other hand  is out of the money  and is worth nothing  which means you lost  150 on the put  
 

Add it all together  and on a  300 investment  you just made a profit of  700  Pretty good   especially for not even knowing which way the stock would go  
 

However  if you paid more for each side of the trade  those would be extra costs to overcome  
 

But by keeping each side s cost as small as reasonably possible  that leaves more profit potential on the winning side and a smaller loss on the losing side  
 

Moreover  if the stock stays flat  in other words  the big move you expect to see doesn t materialize  thus resulting in both sides of the trade expiring worthless   your cost of the trade was kept to a minimum  
 

So buying a straddle by its very nature should be looked at as a short term trade  If the outcome of the event that prompted you to get into the straddle in the first place now has you strongly believing that a continuation of the upmove or downmove is in order  you could then exit the straddle and move into the one sided call or put and apply the in the money and more time rules for those  
 

Here are 5 optionable stocks due to report earnings over the next two weeks that could see some volatile price action one way or the other  

 Alibaba  NYSE BABA

TJX Companies had an incredible day in the market yesterday  while most of the market was seeing declines  The gains are for a good reason  The company reported its earnings for the most recent quarter at the open of the market yesterday morning  blowing away expectations  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from earnings  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from TJX moving forward 
TJX Companies Beats Earnings Expectations And Approves Buyback 
As mentioned above  TJX had an incredible day in the market yesterday after releasing its earnings report for the fourth quarter  The company beat both earnings and revenue expectations as well as approved a big buyback  Here s what we saw from the report 
Earnings Per Share   During the quarter  TJX produced incredible earnings  While analysts expected to see fourth quarter earnings come in at  0 94 per share  the company actually reported earnings in the amount of  0 99 per share  beating expectations by  0 05 
Revenue   In terms of revenue  TJX also blew away expectations  During the fourth quarter  analysts expected that the company would produce revenue in the amount of   87 billion  However  the company actually reported revenue in the amount of  8 96 billion 
Buy Backs   Following the release of the overwhelmingly positive earnings report  TJX made another big announcement  A large buyback has been approved by the company s board of directors  Through the plan  TJX plans to buy back between  1 5 billion and  2 0 billion worth of its own stock  This is incredibly important as companies tend to buy their stock back when they feel as though there is an incredible growth opportunity on the horizons  So  this is a key sign that we can expect to see future growth in the stock 
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  When positive news is released  we expect to see gains and when negative news is released  we expect to see losses  However  there are few pieces of news that have the ability to move the needle in the market quite like earnings  So naturally  we are seeing incredible gains in the value of TJX as the result of of the overwhelmingly strong earnings report  
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from TJX stock  The reality is that the company has proven its ability to grow  Throughout the past four consecutive quarters  the company has beat expectations with regard to earnings  Now  with the buyback in focus  it s clear that insiders in TJX are expecting to see incredible growth in the value of the stock  With a strong team  strong management  and incredible products  I m expecting to see incredible gains in the value of the stock moving forward

178833,400349,TJX,5 Solid Retail Stocks Likely To Beat This Earnings Season ,opinion,"With the earnings season at centre stage  investors are on the lookout for companies that can beat their earnings estimates  While many sectors have already seen over half their companies report earnings  most retailers are yet to come out with their results this season 

Though change is the only constant in the stock market  not much about the economic scenario has altered since the last quarter  which bore the brunt of foreign currency headwinds  weakness in the energy sector and other global worries  These factors  along with slow consumer traffic largely impacted the Retail Wholesale sector as well  which commenced 2016 with soft sales through March 

Further  the recent data compiled by the Conference Board reveals that the Consumer Confidence Index  which had improved to 96 1 March  slipped to 94 2 in April  Also  the gross domestic product  GDP  for the first quarter of 2016 improved only 0 5   against a 1 4  rise witnessed in the preceding quarter  per the Bureau of Economic Analysis 

While these factors are likely to leave any investor perplexed  they shouldn t lose hope as there are a number of bright spots which can bring their cheer back 

Notably  the earnings season hasn t been so bad thus far  implying that either investors were expecting results even weaker than this or the estimates for most companies was already lowered to easy to beat levels  Per the latest   as of Apr 29  2016   out of the S P 500 Retail Wholesale companies that have already reported their quarterly results  84 6  beat earnings and 61 5  surpassed revenue estimates 

Also  a gradual recovery in the housing market and the manufacturing sector  coupled with an improving labor market  is playing a major role in lifting buyers  confidence 

That said  we bring to you five retail stocks that may show promise even amid a not so congenial economic scenario  based on their favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive

178835,400351,TJX,5 DuPont Tested Stocks That Promise Solid Returns,opinion,"Return on equity is one of the top metrics on an investors  mind  when they set out to select stocks  and quite rightly so  However  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to better returns 
Yes  we are talking about DuPont  NYSE DD  analysis  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into different components 
ROE   Net Income Equity
Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
ROE vs DuPont
Although the importance of ROE can t be stressed enough  the fact is that it always doesn t provide a complete picture  But the DuPont analysis allows investors to assess which of the elements is dominant in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having high margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden 
So  an investor looking at two stocks only from an ROE perspective will be impartial if the values are the same  However  DuPont analysis will help to differentiate between the two stocks and find the better one  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three ratios   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring 
DuPont analysis is not very difficult  as the required numbers are available in a company income statement and balance sheet 
However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters
  Profit Margin more than or equal to 5  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE 
  Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales 
  Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets 
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally outperform the market 
  Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed 
Here are 5 of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen 
Philip Morris International  Inc     NYSE PM   
Medifast Inc     NYSE MED   
H   M Hennes   Mauritz AB    OTC HNNMY   
The TJX Companies  Inc     NYSE TJX   
NVR  Inc     NYSE NVR

178855,400371,TJX,Euro Remains Heavy Ahead Of ECB,opinion,The US dollar is broadly firmer though the Antipodean currencies continue to enjoy residual strength  The Canadian dollar is not being dragged up with them on account of Bank of Canada meeting today  Although Governor Poloz dampened expectations for a cut with last week s reiteration that the January rate cut was an insurance policy to buy time  Yesterday s somewhat firmer than expected Q4 GDP  2 4  vs 2 0  consensus  would have seemed to have solidified such expectations  the details were less encouraging  keeping some wary of a cut today  Inventory accumulation accounted for 0 4 percentage points and the two sectors the central bank has identified as key for the recovery  investment and exports both fell  The US dollar has been carving out a large triangle pattern against the Canadian dollar since the end of January  The bottom of the triangle is flattish around CAD 1 2450  The top is marked by a falling trend line that coming in now near CAD1 2620  We look for an eventual break higher  Earlier today  India surprised the market with another 25 bp rate cut  to 7 50   between central bank meetings  The timing surprised the market  and it seemed to be at least in part to a response to the recent budget agreement  China  which cut key lending rates over the weekend  followed up today with a cut in the short term lending facility  The overnight rate was cut 50 bp to 4 50   and the 7 day repo rate was cut to 5 5  from 7   Turning to the other BRIC countries  note that Brazil is widely expected to hike the Selic rate later today by 50 bp to 12 75   Russia s central bank meets at the end of next week  and many are looking for it to cut its key rate  which stands at 15   having peaking at 17  before the late January cut  Japan  UK  and the eurozone reported somewhat disappointing service PMI figures  Japan s was the most disturbing  It fell to 48 5 from 51 3  the lowest since April 2014  The eurozone service PMI slipped to 53 7 from the 53 9 flash reading  It is still higher than the January s 52 7 reading  Hence  the report does not undermine the idea that the region is finding better traction  The UK s service PMI slipped to 56 7 from 57 2 in January  The consensus anticipated a small increase to 57 5  The composite PMI was unchanged at 56 7 as well  This seems broadly consistent with around 0 6  quarterly GDP  Despite the respectable growth  the deflation headwinds appear to have strengthened as BRC shop prices fell 1 7   accelerating from  1 3    Food prices are  0 4  lower than a year ago  vs  0 5  in January   while non food prices are off 2 5   after  1 8  in previously   The euro continues to trade heavily ahead tomorrow s ECB meeting  The optionality and stops around  1 1150 were taken out  and the euro approached  1 1115  The  1 11 area is thought to hold additional barriers  As has characterized Draghi s tenure at the helm of the ECB  a bold action is announced  which is light on details  Later those details are provided  That is what tomorrow s ECB meeting is largely about  details of its sovereign bond purchase plans  In addition  the the Bank of Canada meeting  the North American session features the US service ISM  which is expected to be slightly softer than the 56 7 reading in January  and more importantly the ADP employment estimate  The ADP report appears to have stolen some of the thunder from the national report  However  barring a major surprise with the job creation  which has been particularly volatile  the focus has shifted towards earnings  The ADP report sheds no light on hourly earnings  However  there are a number of developments that point to some modest upside pressure  which the Federal Reserve would like to see before hiking rates  First  as we have noted many cities and states have risen or will raise minimum wage  There has been industrial action on West Coast ports that is now resolved  There is also one of the largest strikes in a couple of decades against refineries  This remains unresolved  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  and T J  Maxx  NYSE TJX  are raising wages this year and next year  That could impact as many as 8 mln workers  Oil prices are firmer following yesterday s API report showing less than a 3 mln barrel build in inventories  somewhat less than expected  The official Department of Energy estimate will be released later today  Meanwhile  the Saudis  heading off calls for an emergency OPEC meeting  suggest the market is stabilizing  and its boosting prices to Asia  where the competition has been among the fiercest  in the last three years  reduces discount  ,2015-03-04,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/euro-remains-heavy-ahead-of-ecb-243869,243869
178856,400372,TJX,Top Stock Trade Idea For The Week  TJX Companies,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea
TJX  NYSE TJX  jumped higher after reporting earnings in August and then consolidated  The stock never pulled back with the market in October and that got some people s attention  In fact as the market started to rise TJX started to push higher through the end of the year  In 2015 it has tightened consolidation against resistance at that end of year high  in an ascending triangle  On a conservative measure  if it breaks to the upside  it would establish a price target of 78  The last leg higher took 2 months 
The momentum indicators are bullish heading into this week  with the RSI moving higher  It has been bullish for over a year  The MACD crossed up Friday  giving it a bullish signal  Finally the Bollinger Bands  are tightening  often a precursor to a move 
There is no resistance above the top at 69 50 to 70  Support lower may be found at 67 60 and 65 65 followed by 64 25 and 61  Short interest is negligible at less than 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next in late May 
TJX Companies  NYSE TJX 

Trade Idea 1  But the stock on a move over 69 75 with a stop at 67 50  A straight stock buy 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the April 70 Calls  offered at  1 00 late Friday  on the same trigger  A defined risk way to participate in upside price action 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the May 70 80 Call Spread  about  1 50   Give the stock more time to move higher and caps the return for lower cost 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the July 65 70 bullish Risk Reversal   1 40   Adds leverage from the short Put and long term upward potential at low cost 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the October 70 80 Call Spread   3 20  and sell the April October 67 5 Put Calendar   2 80 credit  for a net 40 cent cost 
Gives a long term upside potential in the call spread and lowers the cost by selling the Put Calendar  to give big leverage  but also protection through April Expiry 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  Heading into spring  College Basketball s March Madness  the April options cycle and the last full week of March  sees the equity markets are looking strong 
Elsewhere look for gold to bounce higher in its downtrend while Crude Oil consolidates in its downtrend  The US dollar Index is consolidating the move up and US Treasuries are looking strong  The Shanghai Composite is also strong and looks to move higher while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside in the short run but not looking really strong 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and drifting lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s  ARCA SPY    ARCA IWM  and  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts also look good for more upside with the IWM the strongest even at all time highs  and the SPY and QQQ showing signs of a possible short term pause before another move up  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

178857,400373,TJX,Treasuries   Most Oversold Since 2009  But Conflicting Signals Grow,opinion,"While contemplating a couple of different blog posts yesterday  Gary Morrow s  from This Week on Wall Street  TWOWS   pretty much made my decision regarding to what to write about tonight 
Gary and I know each other from our days as co contributors at Jim Cramer s  TheStreet com  or I guess what it is known as today   The Street    through most of the last decade  I think Morrow is a very good technician across a number of different time frames  A former CME trader back in  the day  when the CME currencies were active  Gary cut his chops in open outcry trading at the CME  where technical analysis rules the roost 
Some small positions in the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  ARCA TLT  and the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF  ARCA AGG  were put on to the long side yesterday for clients  given the oversold nature of interest rates  However  another post from Doug McKay  Gary s partner at TWOWS   on SPDR Gold Shares  ARCA GLD  is also worth noting 
On the longer term chart  not shown  the GLD looks like it is forming a longer base  The  why  of gold s suggested bottoming action is as important to me as the base itself  and I wonder if it isn t due to some possible signs of inflation emerging 
WalMart s  NYSE WMT  recent wage hikes  along with TJ Maxx  NYSE TJX  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD  following suit  were one important indicator that the long trend towards disinflation could be ending  It is a guess of course  but I bet the Fed pays more attention to  demand pull  inflation than what is traditionally seen as  cost push   i e  commodity  inflation  but that is one opinion   Long WMT  small position in MCD owned since 2003  
With so much retail sales data so weak  the jobless claims strength is puzzling  but the strength in claims continues unabated 
Finally  the Employment Cost Index  ECI  recent strength is worth noting  Here is the  to the Business Insider story and ECI graph that caught my eye shortly after its release on April 30  15 
Given Morrow s note on the oversold nature of Treasuries  if the TLT does rally  but it can t push through  123 82  or the 200 day moving average  that could be it for record low rates

178875,400391,TJX,Retail s Inventory Management Looks Solid,opinion,"There have been a few comments on retail apparel earnings calls suggesting that retailers are currently managing their inventories relatively tightly   Fossil Group  NASDAQ FOSL   for instance  said this 

 What we discovered or what we experienced in the second quarter was that both with department stores and some of our boutiques  they were really focusing on managing their inventories tightly  And relative to our expectations  we saw some compression on sales because they were reducing their inventory level  

TJX Companies  NYSE TJX  echoed that sentiment on its call Tuesday 

 we are very clean in the stores  In fact  our inventory  well  it s been lean off season and  given the second quarter with sales picking up  our clearance levels are very under control  No real liabilities there  

If this is true  it s a good sign for retail that inventories are under control   Lean inventories are not only more efficient from a working capital standpoint  but also could help signal that the highly promotional environment that retailers have been complaining about is about to let up  If retailers are more conservative with their inventories  they don t have to take as many markdowns to clear it 
If retailers are running their ships more tightly it s not really showing up in financial statements quite yet though   Below is a chart of a few important retailers  days of inventory on hand  365 COGS Inventory  since 2000   If anything it looks like retail inventories have been trending slightly higher as of late   For what it s worth  the Census Bureau s data shows that retailers   is above its recession low  but below where it was at the beginning of the year
