1300,222815,CTL,Telecom Stock Roundup  AT T s Financial Update  Verizon s 5G Deployment   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks scripted a remarkable turnaround and witnessed an upward trajectory  courtesy the last minute  Phase One  trade deal between the United States and China  Although the two sides are yet to sign the agreement  which is likely to take place in January 2020   the partial trade accord represents a major breakthrough in the 21 month standoff between the world s two largest economies  The trade truce buoyed investor sentiments and propelled the industry to mirror broader equity market performance Per the agreement  the Trump administration has called off a 15  tariff on nearly  160 billion worth of imports from China  including toys  smartphones  laptops and other electronics items  In addition  the U S  government will halve its 15  levy on  120 billion worth of Chinese import basket  leaving the tariff regime limited to 25  taxes on  250 billion and 7 5  on  120 billion  In response  the communist nation has suspended the planned addition of 10  and 5  tariffs on some U S  imports  Moreover  China has reportedly agreed to purchase  200 billion of U S  goods over the next two years  including  40  50 billion of agricultural products each year   The deal also aims to iron out the sticking points of forced technology transfer and IP rights protection with China pledging to introduce strict policies to safeguard these issues  The agreement will be strictly monitored by an enforcement arm and will include a dispute resolution mechanism headed by top level executives The trade agreement has offered a much needed respite to the beleaguered industry just before the holiday season  weeding off sector uncertainty and probable tariffs on popular consumer goods and telecom equipment  With the successful completion of the  Phase One  deal  the next round of negotiation is likely to be centered around digital trade

205207,426723,CTL,Better Buy  CenturyLink vs  Verizon,news,"Putting CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  and Verizon  NYSE VZ  in the same ring to duke it out doesn t seem like a fair fight  Verizon is one of the two largest wireless carriers in the country  CenturyLink is a struggling telecommunications provider  fighting for scraps that the industry titans leave behind 
Verizon isn t exactly a market darling  Revenue has risen by no more than 4  in each of the past three years  But it s a speed freak compared with CenturyLink  which has posted declining revenue in five of the past seven years  The two years in which it did manage to shell out positive top line spurts  it was entirely the handiwork of its roughly  25 billion acquisition of Level 3 in 2017 

 
Rolling with the punches
Verizon closed out 2019 with its largest wireless net adds during the fourth quarter in six years  but operating revenue only managed to climb 1 4  for the period  Gains on the wireless and consumer front are being weighed down by the logical fade of its wireline segment  Adjusted earnings also clocked in roughly flat with the prior year s showing  just missing Wall Street s profit target for the first time in more than a year 
Verizon is making big investments in 5G and expanding into other services  but it s still trying to run a tighter ship  It s now more than halfway through completing its 2018 plan to achieve  10 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2021  It sees consolidated revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth accelerating slightly in 2020  rising in the low to mid single digits 
CenturyLink isn t faring as well  It doesn t report its fourth quarter results for another two weeks  but revenue has posted single digit declines through the first three quarters of 2019  Organic growth hasn t been impressive now that we ve lapped the Level 3 acquisition  
It s not all bad news at CenturyLink  It posted sequential top line growth in the third quarter  and it s coming through with improvement in margins on some fronts as its cost savings play out  But it did also fall short on the bottom line in its latest reported quarter  and free cash flow is still stuck in reverse  
The only category in which CenturyLink comes out ahead in this battle with Verizon is when we look at shareholder distributions  CenturyLink s yield of 7 2  is far meatier than Verizon at 4 1   However  Verizon has come through with 13 consecutive years of increased dividends  CenturyLink cut its dividend by more than half last year  It s showing some signs of improvement  but the nod here for the better buy has to go to the steadier and more successful Verizon  Even a dividend investor can t live by high payouts alone ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppgq-,2073012

205209,426725,CTL,These 3 Stocks Are Well Positioned to Drive Growth in the Coming Decade  Top Financial Blogger,opinion,Mr  David Alton Clark  the founder of Clark Capital  has earned a reputation for recommending solid investments that stand the test of time  According to TipRanks  a fintech company that tracks and measures the performance of financial experts  Clark s investment ideas have seen an average yearly return of 25 6  with a success rate of 70   It s not a surprise  then  that Clark has held down the  1 spot on Tiprank s Top 25 Financial Bloggers list for a majority of the past decade Highlighting the current geopolitical and macro economic landscape  Clark advises against making any big bets until the Chinese Coronavirus outbreak is contained  Clark states   Often these types of viral outbreaks effects on the markets are only temporary  Yet  I advise against attempting to catch a falling knife  Wait for the markets to turn prior to starting any new positions  You may miss out on a small amount of the upside  nonetheless  you will have greatly reduced the risk to your hard earned nest egg   Furthermore   with the economic expansion entering its 11th year  the odds of a pullback in the near term are relatively high especially if the coronavirus worsens and caused economic activity to dampen just as the markets are reaching all time highs   says Clark With this in mind  we asked the top financial blogger if he would share his three stock picks for the coming decade  Let s take a closer look Zoom Video Communications  ZM Cloud based video and web conferencing Zoom Video Communications is my speculative high flyer selection  I always suggest an investor allocate at least 5  of their portfolio to a speculative play with the potential for exponential growth This company falls into my long term sustainability thesis I believe more and more companies will adopt  In my heyday as a consultant and auditor for Ernst   Young I traveled far and wide to meet face to face with clients across the country  Now  we are entering an age where visualization will become the norm rather than the exception as companies strive to become better stewards of the environment  This pick seems like a no brainer with all the current focus on climate change and the environment presently  Plus it saves companies time and money  It checks all the boxes for me Zoom is growing by leaps and bounds currently with an over 80  sales growth rate quarter over quarter and 100  EPS growth over the past year  Even so  with a sky high forward P E ratio you could make the case that most of prospects for growth are already priced in  Nonetheless  the stock is currently trading at 30  below its recent 52 week highs  This is definitely a speculative play not to be taken lightly  It will be a wild ride  yet I believe in the end Zoom will come out on top and be a profitable investment over the long haul  High risk equals high reward The stock has fallen on hard times as of late trading 30  off its recent 52 week highs  Nevertheless  it has recently bounced off its lows and is poised to retake its 200 day sma and breakout of the recent downtrend  As always  never plunk down your entire allocation in one fell swoop  Always layer in to new positions overtime to reduce risk especially in the current market environment Wrap upAs I said before  layer into the position as any type of negative macro event may provide a better entry point over the course of the decade  I like to say its  time in  the market not  timing  the market that generates profitable investments and creates long term wealth  My 12 month price target is  100 over the next 12 months providing over 30  near term upside   See Zoom stock analysis on TipRanks CenturyLink  CTL Telecommunications giant CenturyLink is my contrarian income dividend play with potential for capital appreciation  The stock has been in the doghouse for quite some time  yet  has recently shown signs of strength  I see the company well positioned to benefit from the roll out of 5G networks The stock has been under pressure since management cut the dividend  Nonetheless  with a current dividend yield of 7 2  and a forward P E ratio of 9 52  the stock makes for an excellent contrarian turnaround play  Whenever analyzing these types of investments the key factor I look for is cash flow  CenturyLink checks this box with a P FCF ratio of 8 25 and a book value per share of  12 75  So  if I can buy a stock for book value  a 7 2  yield  plenty of free cash flow to cover the dividend and capital expenditures  I am in  As always  take your time building a position  As the recent coronavirus outbreak demonstrates  no one can anticipate an erroneous exogenous event  My primary investing mantra is  Patience equals profits  The stock has recently bounced off the 200 day sma and is current attempting to break through resistance at the 50 day  With and RSI of 49 its neither over bought or oversold  CTL is expected to report earnings on February 12th  With the current macroeconomic environment I would wait until after earnings to initial a position Wrap upThe company just recent double their capacity to transmit content in 11 cities across Asia Pacific  APAC  to cater to growing demands from global broadcasters  over the top  OTT  video streaming platforms and gaming companies to deliver high performing web applications  ultra high definition  UHD  video streaming and game downloads CenturyLink is well positioned to benefit from the coming 5G revolution  With a 7 2  yield and trading for book value  the risk seems well worth the reward at present  I d say we have the potential for 20  upside over the next 12 months  What s more  you get paid 7 2  while you wait   See CenturyLink stock analysis on TipRanks Apple  AAPL Apple is my cash cow solid capital appreciation play  The company is printing money and is well positioned to benefit from the upcoming 5G revolution  Furthermore  Apple has created an ecosystem around its primary product  the iPhone  which is increasingly inescapable  Apple is continuously expanding services and creating new peripheral devices that augur well for continued growth  I would not bet against them  I have been a user of Apple products since day one Apple is a cash flow machine  The company currently has a huge cash hoard of over  200 billion  although it now has approximately  100 billion in debt  With a forward P E of 24 the stock has doubled in valuation over the past 12 months from 12  The stock is up 95  over the past 52 weeks  The fundamentals are looking somewhat rich at the moment  Even so  this may be justified with the advent of 5G just around the corner The current technical status for Apple is somewhat overheated  The stock is trading at just 1  off its 52 week high and has recently gone parabolic  The current trajectory of the stock will be hard to sustain  I would wait for a pullback of 5 10  in the stock prior to imitating a new position  With several supplies located in China Apple has significant exposure to China  If the coronavirus outbreak worsens  we could see the stock pullback significantly  I submit this would be an excellent buying opportunity though Wrap upApple always seems to have another ace up their sleeve  From the Apple Watch to the new Apple Airpods to the new streaming service offering  I only see blue skies ahead in the coming decade  Use any pullbacks to build a full position in the stock  I see 10  upside over the next 12 months with a  356 price target

205210,426726,CTL,Earnings Preview  CenturyLink  CTL  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This communications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 8  
Revenues are expected to be  5 54 billion  down 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CenturyLink 
For CenturyLink  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenturyLink will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CenturyLink would post earnings of  0 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 31  delivering a surprise of  3 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line

205219,426735,CTL,Seattle beat Toronto to claim MLS title,news," Reuters    Seattle Sounders claimed their second MLS Cup in four years as three second half goals gave the hosts a 3 1 win over Toronto FC in front of a capacity crowd at  CenturyLink   NYSE CTL  Field on Sunday 
It was the third time in four years that the teams had met in Major League Soccer s blue riband match  with Kelvin Leerdam  Victor Rodriguez and Raul Ruidiaz all finding the net 
Seattle won their first title when they beat Toronto in 2016 while the Canadians got their revenge in the 2017 title game 
This time  the Sounders delivered the title in front of a record home crowd 
 You get to share this moment with 70 000 people  obviously the love gets amplified a little bit   Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei told reporters 
 To be able to give them this moment means everything to me  
In the latest chapter of the rivalry between the teams  Seattle took the lead after 57 minutes when Leerdam s angled shot hit Toronto defender Justin Morrow and flew into the net

205220,426736,CTL,Take 5  Seahawks in trouble vs  49ers ,news,"Normally  the Seattle Seahawks should have the upper hand in Week 17 s biggest matchup  a rematch with the San Francisco 49ers 
They won the first encounter in Santa Clara  Calif   and now will benefit from the raucous home crowd at  CenturyLink   NYSE CTL  Field in prime time 
And yet  there are many reasons to think Sunday s game won t play out like the first meeting between the NFC West rivals 
1  Injuries undermining Seahawks  offensive identity
On many teams  losing your top three running backs would lead to a shift in offensive identity  toward a pass heavy approach  But that simply isn t the Seahawks 
Head coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer believe in starting with the run  and that isn t going to change with Chris Carson  Rashaad Penny and C J  Prosise all on IR  That s why Seattle signed Marshawn Lynch  but it s hard to know what to expect from a 33 year old running back who hasn t played in 14 months  Counting on Travis Homer as a bell cow is equally unsettling 
Making matters worse  left tackle Duane Brown  the team s best pass blocker and run blocker  is out after meniscus surgery  Second year man Jamarco Jones wasn t as bad Sunday against the Cardinals as Chandler Jones  four sack day would suggest  but he s still a major downgrade  He now will face Nick Bosa and the 49ers  menacing D line 
It certainly doesn t help that quarterback Russell Wilson has lacked sharpness lately  especially with his vision for open receivers  That could change in a heartbeat    and Wilson is always a threat to create with his legs    but the consistency must improve 
2  Clowney ailing  and Kittle returns
The Seahawks  defense mostly contained the 49ers in the first meeting  but the driving force was defensive end Jadeveon Clowney  who racked up a sack  a forced fumble  five quarterback hits  several additional pressures and a fumble recovery for a touchdown 
Clowney has played in only two games since while battling a core muscle injury  and even if he returns this week  it s hard to imagine him being as effective  Offensive tackles Joe Staley and Mike McGlinchey were rusty in Week 10 as both returned from injury  but they ve settled in recently 
Perhaps more importantly for the 49ers  tight end George Kittle is healthy after sitting out the first meeting  As Kyle Shanahan s centerpiece in both the run game and pass game  Kittle s presence can t be understated  He ll draw many of the targets that went to ancillary pieces  like Kendrick Bourne  who had several key drops  in Santa Clara 
Kittle also presents a tough matchup given the Seahawks  defensive preferences  Seattle plays its base 4 3 defense on around 75 percent of the snaps  an extremely high number in today s pass happy NFL  Playing base personnel typically leaves a linebacker  rather than a safety  on the tight end  While Bobby Wagner and K J  Wright are outstanding cover men  Kittle is a difficult cover for any linebacker 
3  Green Bay s highly underappreciated DPOY candidate
Green Bay Packers outside linebacker Za Darius Smith might be the most underrated player in football  Perhaps his evisceration of the Minnesota Vikings  offensive line on Monday night will help change that  but Smith somehow was snubbed for the Pro Bowl despite being a viable Defensive Player of the Year candidate 
After piling up 3 5 sacks and five QB hits against the Vikings  Smith has 13 5 sacks and an NFL high 35 hits this season  more than justifying the four year   66 million contract that some questioned when the Packers signed him this offseason 
Perhaps most impressive about Smith is that he wins from everywhere  and in all kinds of ways  He can come off the edge and turn the corner with speed and hands  or go through offensive tackles with power and leverage  He often lines up inside over guards  whipping them with violent hands and quickness 
Even more intriguing  Smith thrives as a stand up rover  often coming from a yard or two off the ball and timing the snap count before bursting through the A gap  He s been so good in this area that coordinator Mike Pettine has begun incorporating the tactic on first and second down  not just obvious passing situations 
Facing an inconsistent Detroit Lions O line on Sunday  Smith should be able to build on his production in the regular season finale  He probably still won t garner much attention in the DPOY race  but he absolutely deserves first team All Pro honors 
4  Eagles  defense must be sharper
The Philadelphia Eagles allowed just nine points to one the league s most talented offenses last week  keeping Dallas out of the end zone  But the Cowboys  lack of production and scoring was hardly all the Eagles  doing 
Between Dak Prescott s scattershot accuracy and several drops  Dallas had at least 10 routine completions    many that would have gained good chunks    fall incomplete  It was an ugly performance from Prescott  whose injured shoulder was likely a factor  Whatever the reason  the Cowboys did not exploit several Eagles missteps 
The New York Giants  offense is much less talented than the Cowboys   but the unit has scored 77 points across the last two weeks  and rookie quarterback Daniel Jones appears healthy  Between running back Saquon Barkley and rookie wideout Darius Slayton  the Giants have the explosiveness to break big plays  as they did throughout last week s win 
The Eagles  offense lacks the weapons to rack up points against almost anyone    even if Zach Ertz can play through his rib injury    so the defense must be careful 
5  Titans  offense too reliant on explosive plays 
Since Week 10  when they won at Kansas City  the Tennessee Titans have 16 plays of at least 30 yards  tied for second in the NFL over that span despite one week on bye  Those plays have averaged 51 1 yards with eight touchdowns  both of which lead the league 
That sort of explosiveness is staggering for a run heavy offense that changed quarterbacks midseason  Coordinator Arthur Smith has been outstanding with his play action designs  and Ryan Tannehill has been decisive and razor sharp with his accuracy  Running back Derrick Henry and rookie wideout A J  Brown are both terrors in the open field 
But are the big plays sustainable 
Brown  remarkably  has accounted for six 30 yard plus gains since Week 10  but he s benefited from poor coverage and tackling  One came on a run  a misdirection toss play last week  the type of play that normally goes for 20 to 30 yards  not a 49 yard touchdown 
Another huge gain  57 yards  came on a run by  of all people  tight end Jonnu Smith  on a relatively standard crack toss play after Smith lined up at running back  Smith also broke multiple tackles on a 41 yard TD last week  and Tajae Sharpe scored a 36 yarder on a broken play in which Tannehill ad libbed  These sorts of plays feel more like outliers than the norm 
Smith s run came in Week 15 s loss to the Houston Texans  who the Titans must beat Sunday to ensure a playoff berth  Tennessee s only longer gain in that contest was a 60 yard go route to Brown  requiring a great route and a perfect throw  Together  those two plays accounted for 27 1 percent of the Titans  yardage 
That s not to say Tennessee can t create more big plays at Houston  but two proved too few last time  And if the explosive plays disappear  the offense could dry up quickly

205221,426737,CTL,Why CenturyLink s Stock Fell 12 8  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Louisiana based telecom CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  fell 12 8  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  The bulk of the decline occurred in the spring  followed by relative peace and quiet in the summer and fall 
So what
There was nothing terribly wrong with CenturyLink s earnings report in February    the company met Wall Street s revenue estimates and beat analysts  consensus projections on the bottom line  However  the stock took its first big step down of 2019 the next day  because CenturyLink also slashed its quarterly dividend from  0 54 to  0 25 per share 
Management explained that the reduction wasn t due to any critical need for extra cash  but that it wanted to speed up the rate at which it was paying down its debt  with the goal of bringing CenturyLink s  leverage to less than 3 25 times adjusted EBITDA earnings  That argument went over like a lead balloon with investors  triggering a slow slide in CenturyLink s share prices over the next couple of months  The slide was accelerated by a delayed 10 K filing  and didn t stop until management announced that CenturyLink was looking for a buyer for its consumer services business  By the middle of May  the stock had dropped 30 6  year to date 
That low point didn t exactly mark the start of a turnaround  but CenturyLink s stock price largely followed the trends of the broader market for the rest of the year 

Now what
CenturyLink should be able to hit its debt reduction target in three years  according to management  but that forecast assumes that its adjusted EBITDA profits rise over the next few years  The company s leverage ratio  which was raised by the massive buyout of Level 3 Communications in 2017  stood at 4 0 times adjusted EBITDA at the time of the dividend reduction  
It was good to finally see the company grab the debt monster by the horns  even if it had to steeply cut its payouts to do so  I still find it difficult to get excited about this stock  even its current bargain bin valuations of 9 2 times forward earnings and 1 0 times book value  The stock is priced for utter disaster and nearly 10  of the shares are still sold short  I wouldn t touch this ticker with a  buy  button on a 10 foot pole under these risky circumstances  There are simply too many better investment ideas out there today ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgh2s,2056970

Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  is a stock many investors are watching right now  CTL is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 9 83  which compares to its industry s average of 13 03  CTL s Forward P E has been as high as 14 19 and as low as 7 31  with a median of 9 32  all within the past year 
CTL is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 33  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CTL s industry currently sports an average PEG of 2 72  Within the past year  CTL s PEG has been as high as 3 18 and as low as  9 46  with a median of 0 87 
Another notable valuation metric for CTL is its P B ratio of 1 03  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 75  Over the past 12 months  CTL s P B has been as high as 1 21 and as low as 0 63  with a median of 0 92 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  CTL has a P S ratio of 0 61  This compares to its industry s average P S of 0 97 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in CenturyLink s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  CTL looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2020-01-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-centurylink-ctl-stock-200496703,200496703

cents per share compared with  272 million or 25 cents per share in the year ago quarter  The improvement was primarily due to higher operating income and lower interest expense Net income  excluding the aggregate effects of integration and transformation costs  and special items of  26 million and  55 million  respectively  came in at  328 million or 31 cents per share compared with  327 million or 30 cents per share in the prior year quarter  The bottom line  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny RevenuesQuarterly consolidated operating revenues declined 3 6  year over year

million compared with  785 million reported in the prior year quarter mainly due to decline in legacy voice services  Revenues from Wholesale declined 6 6  year over year to  1 025 million  despite

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CenturyLink shares have lost about 21 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15  
What s Next for CenturyLink 
While CenturyLink has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CenturyLink was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

205258,426774,CTL,Take 5  Mahomes vs  Sacksonville highlights Week 5,news,"The crown jewel of Week 5 will be Sunday s game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City  In the best matchup on one side of the ball we ve seen this season  the NFL s stingiest scoring D  14 0 points per game  will try to slow down Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid s top scoring unit  36 2   Mahomes has already torn up the Chargers  and 49ers  defenses    which branch from the same Cover 3 heavy tree as Jacksonville s scheme    but the Jags offer more schematic complexity and an entirely different level of talent  How Jalen Ramsey matches up to Tyreek Hill will steal headlines  but let s start with what should be the most critical battleground  the trenches  1  Showtime Mahomes meets Sacksonville Between the Chiefs  endless weapons and Reid s scheming  it s easy to overlook a front five that has been the NFL s best in pass protection  Kansas City ranks second in sack rate  3 6 percent  and first in sacks allowed  five  after holding the Broncos  fearsome rush to one sack on 47 dropbacks Monday night  Mahomes  escapability helps    he routinely slithered out of trouble in Denver    but scrambling QBs  Russell Wilson  Ben Roethlisberger or Aaron Rodgers to name a few  usually inflate sack totals  That has yet to bear out in K C   where the Chiefs  front has been excellent at sustaining blocks initially and then fighting to the whistle once a rusher gains a step  With former Browns first round bust Cameron Erving emerging at left guard  there are no weak links in the bunch  Left tackle Eric Fisher and center Mitch Morse are steady veterans who almost never whiff blocks  Right guard Laurent Duvernay Tardif  M D   is less consistent  but he works effectively in tandem with Mitchell Schwartz  who remains a premier right tackle  That chemistry will be tested heavily on Sunday  Rather than relying solely on the ample talent up front  defensive coordinator Todd Wash    who was the team s D line coach from 2013 15    employs a litany of stunts and twists to further exacerbate opposing protections  Calais Campbell and Malik Jackson are superb at setting up such ploys with crushing power  and Yannick Ngakoue and Dante Fowler Jr  have the lateral burst to loop and finish  When rushing head on  Campbell s power and hands make him a threat from any position along the line  Ngakoue looks even scarier in his third season after supplementing exceptional burst and bendability with an improved bull rush and hand fighting techniques  Jackson  Fowler and Marcell Dareus are each dangerous enough to win on a given play as well  Mahomes showed in Denver he can beat great coverage when the rush doesn t get home  It s up to the Jaguars  front to make sure he doesn t get many chances  2  Hill presents unique challenge for Ramsey No defense creates pressure on every play  of course  and you can be sure Mahomes won t be too shy to test the game s top cornerback  Hill doesn t seem timid about the matchup  either   He think high of himself   Hill told reporters of Ramsey   He s alright  I guess  I can t wait to line up against him  I hope he presses me   Careful what you wish for  When Ramsey jams  receivers rarely escape his 33 3 8 inch tentacles cleanly  Then again  the 5 foot 8  185 pound Hill presents an awfully small target  and his world class speed makes for a devastating punishment if the press whiffs  But that won t scare Ramsey  who is not only the NFL s most gifted corner  and he knows it  but also one of its most technically sound  The third year pro has the timing  feel and burst to squeeze deep routes into the sideline  Likewise  his lower body fluidity is astonishing for his size  allowing him to pivot or break downhill at the top of routes with ease  With how often the Chiefs move Hill around  he and Ramsey might meet on less than half of the game s snaps  and Ramsey should win most battles at the line of scrimmage  But Hill could swing the matchup by getting loose for a home run  especially given Reid s proclivity for exploiting Cover 3 and Cover 4 with downfield designs  3  Josh Rosen needs someone  anyone  to co star You ll probably read something Sunday evening or Monday morning declaring Rosen s second start a  breakout  game  citing a tidy stat line  Don t fall for the false narrative  The most NFL ready passer of the 2018 class    and the fourth QB taken because some coaches can t stand a know it all    looked like exactly that against the Seahawks in his starting debut  But you d never know it from the box score  15 of 27  180 yards  one TD   in large part because he got little help  Rosen s second and fourth attempts clanged off the hands of Larry Fitzgerald  of all people   and rookie Christian Kirk  respectively  voiding gains of 17 and 30 yards  His seventh attempt was a 27 yard touchdown    threaded through the needle of Tre Flowers and a shaded Earl Thomas    until replay showed Chad Williams got only one foot inbounds  All three were surgically accurate throws despite Seahawks pressure  It didn t end there  Rosen s ninth throw went off  I kid you not  Fitzgerald s hands  preventing an 11 yard TD  albeit against tight coverage  His 12th was dropped 51 yards downfield by wide open speedster J J  Nelson  Six plays later  an 18 yard would be TD to Kirk was disrupted by defensive pass interference  setting up David Johnson s 1 yard score  It s not unrealistic to say Rosen could have been 21 of 28 for 354 yards and four scores  Beyond missed opportunities  Rosen looked and played like a seasoned vet  He audibled to a tunnel screen to beat an overload blitz  used a shoulder roll to fool Bobby Wagner and open a void in his zone  and routinely stepped up calmly through muddy pockets with his eyes downfield  He was hit seven times but sacked only once  and led drives at the end of both halves that ended Phil Dawson misses  Rosen s ability should shine through more easily in Santa Clara this week  Despite DeForest Buckner s strong start  the 49ers rank 27th in sack rate  and coordinator Robert Saleh s Cover 3 heavy defense has been regularly exploited by flood concepts and seam throws  If Rosen can get more than a modicum of help from his teammates  the once moribund Cardinals offense should look much more lively  4  These Rams are built to bully the Seahawks Favored by seven on Sunday  L A  is the largest favorite at  CenturyLink   NYSE CTL  Field since the Saints  favored by 10  lost the  Beastquake  game in January of 2011  As strange as it sounds  the spread should probably be larger  Even overlooking Sean McVay s scorching offense    which gets to pick on an Earl Thomas less secondary    the Rams  front seven vs  the Seahawks  O line is a more overwhelming mismatch than usual  Aaron Donald   Co  have gone through Russell Wilson s protection like wet toilet paper for years now  but Ndamukong Suh s arrival should make Seattle s front five more like melting whipped cream  The Rams  modest total of eight sacks belies an NFL high 41 4 percent pressure rate  per Pro Football Focus   and Suh is a major reason why  He gets there himself    two sacks  T most on team   six QB hits  most     but also pushes pockets with raw power  setting up teammates by keeping quarterbacks from stepping up  He hounds opposing centers but has also been shockingly dangerous on the edge  picking up both of his sacks from there  including one through a chip block vs  the Chargers  Between Suh s forays outside and flashes from intriguing fourth round rookie John Franklin Myers  concerns about L A  s edge pressure have been soothed  Inside  Donald and Suh can only be slowed  not stopped  Wilson has taken four sacks per game  You get the picture  The Rams left Seattle last December with a 35 point win  and the rivals have gone in opposite directions since  It might get ugly again on Sunday  5  Fan the Falcons aTakk Big Ben  Stopping Ben Roethlisberger with yet another key defender out  Grady Jarrett  ankle  seems nearly impossible  but the job might fall to blossoming second year defensive end Takk McKinley  McKinley isn t yet a down to down force  especially in the run game  but his explosiveness could produce the splash play Atlanta s defense needs  Unlike one dimensional teammate Vic Beasley  McKinley s game has enough power to complement his tremendous speed and burst  The 250 pounder used excellent leverage and drive on bull rushes for two of his three sacks against the Bengals last week  including one after lining up at 3 technique against guard Alex Redmond  
McKinley s third takedown was initially ruled a strip sack that he recovered for a critical turnover midway through the fourth quarter  before being overturned on review  In a likely shootout between two teams that can t afford to lose  that s exactly the sort of play Atlanta s defense must make on Sunday to swing the outcome    Field Level Media",2018-10-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/take-5-mahomes-vs-sacksonville-highlights-week-5-1634186,1634186

Prior to today s trading  shares of the communications company had gained 0 44  over the past month  This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector s gain of 3 47  and the S P 500 s gain of 2 8  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from CTL as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be August 7  2019  In that report  analysts expect CTL to post earnings of  0 31 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 19 23   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  5 63 billion  down 6 86  from the year ago period 
CTL s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  1 32 per share and revenue of  22 41 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  10 92  and  4 97   respectively 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for CTL should also be noted by investors  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model

205264,426780,CTL,FLM All 32  Team by team NFL notes,news,"AFC East Buffalo Bills  NBC Sports  Peter King has been covering football a long time and has seen really bad player debuts and really good ones  He marked the first career start of Bills quarterback Josh Allen in the not too bad category   Well  I thought it was better than I expected   King said   He is obviously going to have difficultly with protection issues  the Bills are  And so you re probably not going to be able to use everything  You wonder how many seven step drops he has  when he does take snaps from under center  when that happens  but overall you know  I d give him a good mark   Miami Dolphins  Will the real  FitzMagic  please stand up  That s a nickname that has been associated with Tampa Bay quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick in the past  and with his hot start in 2018  it s gotten a lot of use  But one player is officially laying claim to it  Representatives of Dolphins defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick last week filed a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on his behalf  Fitzpatrick    Minkah  that is    wants to sell merchandise and apparel using the moniker  His mother said the Alabama product  whom the Dolphins took 11th overall in April s draft  has used the nickname since high school  New England Patriots  Down 14 0 to Jacksonville after the first quarter Sunday  Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels huddled together the offense    and yelled  He explained why on a conference call   Our overall performance  I feel like that s what my job is and so I didn t do a good enough job obviously on Sunday   he said   We didn t score enough points  didn t produce enough first downs  didn t control the game at all  and we weren t playing as well as any of us would like at that point in the day  I think part of coaching is understanding there s times where you do things quietly and pull somebody aside  and there s other times where you either just want to try to create a spark or what have you and just refocus on the things that are really important  and that s really all I was doing   New York Jets  Football fans lauded the most recent season of HBO s  Hard Knocks   which featured the Cleveland Browns  The Jets meet the Browns on Thursday night  and coach Todd Bowles was asked this week if he learned anything about the opponent from the show  He said he hadn t watched it   I watch  Power  and  Queen of the South  and that is about it   he said   That s my leisure time   The 2010 Jets  coached by the animated Rex Ryan  were the subject of  Hard Knocks  that season  Would Bowles ever want his team on the show   If I had to do it  we d do it   he said   But  I d probably be the most boring person on the show  I don t think they want to come this way   AFC North Baltimore Ravens  Left tackle Ronnie Stanley is expected to be a game time decision Sunday when Von Miller and the Denver Broncos are in town  When Stanley was hurt last Thursday at Cincinnati  he was replaced by right tackle James Hurst  and Orlando Brown Jr  entered the game at right tackle  Neither matchup is ideal for the Ravens against Miller  who has 4 0 sacks in two games to lead the NFL  Stanley would not confirm reports that he injured his right arm  and said he wouldn t have final say in whether he plays this week   It is coach Harbaugh s decision   Stanley said  Cincinnati Bengals  With kicker issues aplenty around the league  the Bengals this week moved to lock up placekicker Randy Bullock with a two year extension through the 2020 season  Bullock has made all 12 of his kicks this season  four field goals  and 27 of 30 field goals with the Bengals  Head coach Marvin Lewis said his confidence in Bullock was high  but it wasn t always that way  Bullock missed two extra points and a potential game winning field goal last season  At that time  Lewis said the misses  affect our patience level   Cleveland Browns  When you have one victory in a span of 37 games  progress is measured any way possible  Quarterback Tyrod Taylor is expecting the Browns to realize a major breakthrough this season  and the fourth quarter of the last week s game at New Orleans is a big reason why   For us to take the ball down and score in a critical moment and then to get the ball back down the field for a chance to tie the game was definitely some growth   said Taylor  who completed a pair of passes to set up the potential game tying field goal in the final 21 seconds of the loss   It is our job to keep getting better   Pittsburgh Steelers  While the Tampa Bay Buccaneers voice optimism first round pick Vita Vea could be in the lineup on  Monday Night Football   the Steelers are still gauging the availability of both of their offensive guards  David DeCastro and Ramon Foster  DeCastro didn t play Week 2 with a fractured hand  and Foster is  managing a knee injury   according to coach Mike Tomlin  Offensive tackle Marcus Gilbert  hamstring  is also on the injury report  DeCastro said he hopes his injury would be a one game issue  Tomlin would only say DeCastro  has a chance  to go against the Buccaneers  Vea  a 347 pound nose tackle  has been mostly idle since being carted off the field with a calf injury on July 29  His return would give Tampa Bay a likely jolt alongside Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy  AFC South Houston Texans  Quarterback Deshaun Watson said he s not worried about the Houston area superintendent of schools making an inflammatory comment about the trustworthiness of black quarterbacks  Lynn Redden    superintendent of the Onalaska Independent School District in the Piney Woods  about an hour north of Houston    is reportedly under investigation for a comment made on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  about Watson holding onto the ball as time ran out in Week 2  Redden claimed he thought the comment was a direct message   When you need precision decision making you can t count on a black quarterback   Redden wrote  later admitting to the message in a Houston Chronicle interview  Texans coach Bill O Brien shared his pointed thoughts on the post Wednesday   I really don t want to waste a lot of time responding to outdated  inaccurate  ignorant  idiotic statements  I ll just let Deshaun s proven success on the field  and  his character off the field speak for itself  He s one of the greatest guys I ve ever coached  He represents everything that s right about football  about life  His teammates respect him  his coaching staff respects him  In this day and age  it s just amazing that BS exists  but it does   Indianapolis Colts  Le Raven Clark could remain in the lineup at left tackle Sunday  and the task is tall against the Philadelphia Eagles  deep defensive line rotation  Clark started at left tackle in Week 2 when Anthony Castonzo s chronic hamstring injury kept him on the sideline  after Joe Haeg filled in for Castonzo in Week 1  Castonzo will attempt to return and make his season debut against the Eagles  but head coach Frank Reich indicated the Colts are playing it safe with quarterback Andrew Luck s blind side protector   We think he s going to be back   Reich said  cautioning that both player and coach expected Castonzo to start at Washington  Jacksonville Jaguars  Leonard Fournette was back on the field for practice Wednesday  returning for the first time since he exited the Week 1 win over the New York Giants with a hamstring injury  Fournette  who said his hamstring popped  did not play last week in the Jaguars  win over the Patriots  But his understudy  T J  Yeldon  missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury  Quarterback Blake Bortles said Fournette looked good   It looked like he was Leonard  He was flying around  making some good plays  He got some touches and looked good   Bortles said  Tennessee Titans  Quarterback Marcus Mariota experienced tingling in two of his fingers  and the Titans are not sure when he will be ready to return from an elbow injury suffered Week 1  Mariota took the practice field Wednesday with the index and middle fingers cut out of a glove on his throwing hand  He said the issue is with the nerves in those fingers   It s getting better  but it is frustrating  It is hard because it s one of those things where you can t really do a whole lot   Mariota said  Blaine Gabbert  who started Week 2 and guided Tennessee to a 20 17 win over Houston  will continue to take the first team reps with the offense in preparation for Sunday s game with the Jaguars  AFC West Denver Broncos  Quarterback Case Keenum isn t known for his legs  but he had three carries for 16 yards and a touchdown Sunday in a comeback win over the Oakland Raiders  However  he paid a bit of a price  missing Wednesday s practice with left knee soreness   I guess I need to slide a few more times instead trying to go run and bounce around off of defenders   Keenum told reporters Wednesday  adding he wanted to practice but coaches held him out   But I want to get a first down  I want to score  I m competitive in that way   Coach Vance Joseph expects Keenum to return to practice Thursday and play on Sunday in Baltimore  Kansas City Chiefs  As fantastic as Patrick Mahomes  season has started  coach Andy Reid knows that opposing teams will get a better read on the young QB as they get more film to study   That s the challenge   Reid said Wednesday   As they study him  you ve got to be able to rise up and do that  Is there going to be a hiccup here or there  Yeah  there s going to be learning experiences going on here  And everything hasn t been roses to this point    it looks like it  but that s not been the case   Reid added that Mahomes got great experience in training camp going against defensive coordinator Bob Sutton s complex designs  but he expects other challenges   Everybody s got their flavor  on defense   and you ve got to be able to answer it   Reid said   If you don t answer it  then you ve got problems   Los Angeles Chargers  Most out of conference games inherently feature unfamiliarity between opponents  but Philip Rivers has a pretty good feel for the Los Angeles Rams  defense after playing for Wade Phillips from 2004 to 2006 and facing him twice a year when Phillips was with the Broncos in 2015 and 2016   They don t try to trick you with their scheme   Rivers said Monday   They just line up and say they re better than you  and shoot  that works for them a lot of the time  So it ll be a heck of a challenge   Rivers is also all too familiar with former Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and former Chiefs corner Marcus Peters  whose four picks of Rivers are his most against any single QB   I d put  em up there with the top corners in the league  both those guys   Rivers said  Oakland Raiders  Despite Derek Carr s 29 for 32 day against the Broncos on Sunday  wide receiver Jordy Nelson again wasn t heavily involved in the offense  finishing with two catches for 30 yards  The former Green Bay Packer now has five grabs for 53 yards through two games  but those numbers should increase  according to coach Jon Gruden   We expect to see more and more from Jordy as the weeks unfold   Gruden said Wednesday    Amari  Cooper had a big week last week   Jared  Cook had a big week in Week 1  Hopefully Jordy has one this week   Cooper broke out in Denver with 10 grabs for 116 yards  one game after having just one catch for 9 yards  NFC East Dallas Cowboys  With the addition of Brice Butler  the Cowboys now have seven wide receivers  One of them  Cole Beasley  doesn t seem worried about how quarterback Dak Prescott will distribute the ball   Like I ve been saying  the strength is in the group   Beasley said  via The Dallas Morning News   We don t need a No  1  superstar type guy  When you spread the ball around and each guy just makes their plays when their number is called upon  it s like the same thing  I think it just makes us that much harder to defend  not knowing where the ball is going to go   New York Giants  Coach Pat Shurmur has named veteran John Greco as the starting center  replacing Jon Halapio  Halapio was lost for the season with a broken leg and broken ankle that he suffered during the 20 13 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday night   We ll start with John and then obviously get Spencer ready to go   Shurmur said during a conference call   We have guys on the roster who have played center  John Greco went in there and played and then we brought in Spencer Pulley on the roster who played all last season at center  with the Chargers   so we ve got guys that have done it and they ll just slide up and get ready to go   Philadelphia Eagles  Quarterback Carson Wentz will reclaim his starting spot Sunday  more than nine months after suffering a serious knee injury  And one of the men charged with protecting him  right tackle Lane Johnson  doesn t want him to try to do too much   All he has to do is just be Carson Wentz   Johnson said  via the team s website   You don t have to be Superman  You don t have to go out of the way to make plays  just do what you do  Don t overcomplicate it  He just needs to be him  He s super talented  super humble  and works hard man  so he ll be fine   Washington Redskins  Safety D J  Swearinger said his team might have gotten too self satisfied after a Week 1 win when it came time to the following game    a 21 9 home loss to Indianapolis   We can t relax   he told the Washington Post   Last week     for whatever reason  there was complacency in the building  But we haven t done anything  so we should never get complacent around here  I feel like we just gotta work as hard as we can this week to be focused on the little things and the little details  because they re going to be huge going against  Week 3 opponent  Green Bay   NFC North Chicago Bears  Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky remains his own harshest critic  which is not a major shock to head coach Matt Nagy  Nagy said Wednesday he wants Trubisky not to dwell on individual plays that don t work  and to leave failed drives in the past to avoid carrying the weight into more important spots in the game  One area in which Trubisky is excelling is throwing on the move  Nagy said changing the launch point is elevating Trubisky s comfort level and confidence   Mitch does a really good job   Nagy said   He did it in college  He was really good outside the pocket  And so we need to be able to figure out ways to do that and where we feel it s advantageous for the offense and I know he s comfortable in that   Detroit Lions  Matt Patricia s NFL voyage began with the New England Patriots as a quality control coach in 2004  when his best friend on the support staff of Bill Belichick was an offensive assistant  They ll convene again Sunday night at Ford Field when first time head coach Patricia goes for his first win by trying to stop that assistant    current Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels   Josh and I are really close   Patricia said   I think the two of us leaned on each other quite a bit  helped each other out a lot as young coaches and developing into wherever we are right now      Utmost respect for him   Even McDaniels expects a few surprises from Patricia   He ll keep you off balance  There s definitely an element of spinning the wheel with Matt   McDaniels told Masslive com  Green Bay Packers  Cornerback Kevin King s groin injury kicked the door open for the Minnesota Vikings  fourth quarter rally last week  and King is a longshot to return this week at Washington  King  23  was a first round pick in 2017    his season ended early due to a shoulder injury    and helped frustrate Kirk Cousins through three quarters in Sunday s game  Without King  the Packers are going to need to be creative   We probably didn t handle Kevin King s injury very well   McCarthy said   We just weren t as detailed down the stretch  It was obviously an ability for them to extend drives  and they hit the big play there on the  75 yard Stefon Diggs  touchdown  too   Minnesota Vikings  Settling the kicker position might finally be checked off of general manager Rick Spielman s to do list  The Vikings parted with kicker Daniel Carlson in what head coach Mike Zimmer described as an easy decision after Carlson failed to deliver in overtime at Green Bay  His replacement happens to be the second most accurate kicker in NFL history  Dan Bailey  Bailey was on the street only because the Dallas Cowboys opted not to pay his  4 million salary and released him Sept  1   I wanted to go somewhere that had an opportunity to win and be a part of an organization that s right there and right on the brink of having a lot of success   Bailey said Wednesday   When this situation came up  it fit the bill perfectly  I can t complain about eight games out of the year inside  at U S  Bank Stadium   that was a plus   NFC South Atlanta Falcons  Injuries are denting the depth chart of the Falcons  and wide receiver Julio Jones was the latest casualty  Jones missed Wednesday s practice with a calf injury  but the injury is not considered serious  Head coach Dan Quinn called Jones day to day  and of more concern are the potential absences against the New Orleans Saints of running back Devonta Freeman  knee  and defensive ends Takk McKinley and Derrick Shelby  groin injuries   Already down multiple starters due to injury  the latest role player to be thrust into a starting role  guard Wes Schweitzer  is stepping in for Andy Levitre  who was placed on injured reserve Monday with a triceps injury  Carolina Panthers  Linebacker Luke Keuchly grew up 25 miles from Cinergy Field    formerly home of the Cincinnati Bengals    and dreamed of wearing a tiger striped helmet  In high school  he was a lacrosse rival of Bengals coach Marvin Lewis  son  Marcus  On Sunday  he ll play a professional game against the Bengals for the second time  The previous game was a 37 37 tie in Cincinnati in 2014  and Kuechly led all players with 13 tackles   I was a Bengals fan   Kuechly said  recalling a game in which Corey Dillon rushed for nearly 200 yards against the Browns  Lewis said the Bengals are  still trying to clone guys like Luke Kuechly around here   New Orleans Saints  Lamenting a stagnant running game and other issues with his typically potent offense was not a high priority for Sean Payton on Wednesday  but he has made a call for more playmaking from Saints tight ends  Veteran Benjamin Watson has been the primary tight end this season with Josh Hill playing about 20 percent of offensive snaps  Watson has seven catches in two games   I can play better  definitely  make more plays  do more   Watson said   That s the goal  The goal is always to get better  so I definitely feel like I can get better   Drew Brees uncharacteristically missed a wide open Watson in the end zone in the first quarter on Sunday  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  Ryan Fitzpatrick is guaranteed only one more start before Jameis Winston s suspension ends  Buccaneers coach Dirk Koetter is not planning to commit to either one until he s required to do so  Winston can be activated Tuesday  one day after Tampa hosts the Pittsburgh Steelers on  Monday Night Football   Fitzpatrick has nine of the team s 10 touchdowns  one rushing  in two games and completed 78 7 percent of his passes entering Week 3  good for a passer rating of 151 5  A third stellar showing against a Steelers defense lit up for 42 points by second year quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs last week could shift the impending decision   Right now we re going to start working on Pittsburgh  and that s all that matters right now   Koetter said   Everything else is in the future because it could all change just like that   NFC West Arizona Cardinals  At 0 2 with the league s second worst point differential  minus 52   the Cardinals don t have a lot to hang their hats on  but there could be reinforcements coming Sunday against the Chicago Bears  Tight end Jermaine Gresham and defensive end Markus Golden  who are each returning from serious injuries sustained in 2017  returned to a full practice Wednesday for the first time this season   That is a major plus when you are talking about a team that is 0 2  that needs a spark  needs some energy   coach Steve Wilks said   Those two guys definitely bring that  particularly Jermaine  Very vocal  high strung guy  Loves to compete  is going to get his teammates going  And Markus is the same way  I can t wait to get those guys back out there  and hopefully it s this week   Los Angeles Rams  After adding three players with a combined 12 Pro Bowl nods to their name  five each for Ndamukong Suh and Aqib Talib  two for Marcus Peters  this offseason  the Rams  defense is off to a scorching start  The unit has allowed the fewest points  13  and first downs  25  in the NFL while ranking third in yards per game  fourth in interception rate and fifth in yards per play  Talib and Peters have been particularly special  allowing just 37 yards combined through two weeks  per Pro Football Focus  This week  they face a familiar foe in Philip Rivers  whom Talib has intercepted once and Peters has intercepted four times  more than he s victimized any other QB   I d put  em up there with the top corners in the league  both those guys   Rivers said Wednesday  San Francisco 49ers  After serving a two game suspension  middle linebacker Reuben Foster returns to the team this week  an addition that coach Kyle Shanahan expects to make a major difference   Reuben s one of our best players   Shanahan said Wednesday   Just having his presence out there  just from a leadership standpoint  guys gravitate to him  We really enjoy having him around   Shanahan added that Foster  seems great mentally  and should be in good shape after two weeks off  The team has not decided yet how to use Foster with fellow

205266,426782,CTL,CenturyLink   Sale Of The Century,opinion,"Always interesting to analyse stocks in a longer term downtrend and CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  is certainly one such stock  which has seen its share price slump from a high of over  24 per share towards the end of last year  to the current level of  10 23 at the time of writing  as we prepare to see a move into single figures  This stock has many of the characteristics of Ford  NYSE F   F  which I have highlighted in other analysis  and which has since managed to recover back into double figures  So the question now pressing CTL watchers is simple   is it time to buy  And for an answer let s start with volume 
Here we certainly see initial stopping volume during February and also March with two stand out high volume weeks  both characterised with deep wicks to the lower body as the market makers move in to absorb some of the heavy selling  This has also been repeated once more in early May with further buying on a similar candle  Last week s limp effort to rally was a sign the stock is not yet ready to reverse and therefore further  mopping up  is likely with a congestion phase to follow  Patience is therefore required before any reversal can take hold 
So one for a speculative buy once we have moved deeper into single figures  and if you want to see how this chart is likely to develop in the weeks and months ahead  check out Ford  Then it s a question of selecting the entry level once a platform of support has been built  and any resistance breached ",2019-05-22,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sale-of-the-century-200423689,200423689

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This communications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 28 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12  
Revenues are expected to be  5 73 billion  down 3 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 64  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CenturyLink 
For CenturyLink  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenturyLink will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CenturyLink would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 37  delivering a surprise of  2 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 25 93   A quarter ago  it was expected that this communications company would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 37  delivering a surprise of 2 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
CenturyLink  which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry  posted revenues of  5 65 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 43   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 95 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CenturyLink shares have lost about 24 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 1  
What s Next for CenturyLink 
While CenturyLink has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CenturyLink was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Blog 5G Likely to Spearhead Innovations in Global FarmingWith the telecom industry on the cusp of 5G boom  various technological firms are aiming to stretch the boundaries of 5G to reap its immense benefits across diverse industries  The farming industry is the latest to be bitten by the 5G bug as it aims to automate production and scale up farm outputs for future population explosion Why 5G 5G is billed as the technology of the future with faster download speed and seamless transfer of data  Leveraging state of the art communication network architectures  5G is touted to be the primary catalyst for next generation Internet of Things  IoT  services  These include connected cars coupled with augmented reality and virtual reality platform  smart cities and connected devices that revolutionize key industry verticals  Moreover  5G is likely to augment the scalability  security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry  which is expected to lead to the wide proliferation of IoT Leveraging such technological advancements  the farming industry is using remote sensors and drones as key tools to test and collate data for the latest farming technologies  Drones with 5G capabilities have been used to boost potato production in the Netherlands through precision agriculture tests  The test involved capturing accurate images of the field through a camera drone and sent to an agricultural machine through 5G mobile connection on real time basis  This has helped to set the precise dose for proper protection of the crop from pests to boost farm productivity  As the entire process required large bandwidth hitherto unavailable in existing 4G networks  5G emerged as the perfect option to achieve the desired results  Moreover  it saved time for farmers to physically scan the entire field to detect the quantum of pesticide required for the crops Other 5G Innovations in Farming5G sensors  artificial intelligence and cloud computing methods are increasingly being adopted in Japan to monitor water temperature and salt concentration in oyster farms  Drones with 5G capabilities are used to capture images of fish as they swim in large tanks in farmed fishing  These images are then analyzed to calculate the timing and volume of seafood required according to the weight of the fish  These efficient farming operations are vital to sustain the growing industry that is crippled with shrinking workforce and aging population  Moreover  it helps to reduce seafood wastages to a large extent and improves farm productivity A U K  government initiative with support from tech firm Cisco Systems  Inc  has launched a smartphone app called Me Moo to track  connected  cows  The project involves 5G connected collars that send daily updates on the cow s health and behavioral patterns for accurate data  Veterinarians and nutritionists can then monitor this data for proper feeds and medicines that would have been otherwise been impossible for farmers to do on an individual basis on large farmlands Road AheadSuch technological innovations seem to be the call of the hour to bridge the gap between the soaring global population and the food produce required to feed it  Per the UN Food and Agriculture Organization  the world will need to grow 70  more food in 2050 than it did in 2009  No wonder that leading technological firms are pitching in their contribution to spearhead innovations in the farming industry  At the same time  firms like T Mobile US  Inc   CenturyLink  Inc  and United States Cellular Corp  are working tirelessly for rural broadband expansion to benefit the overall industry With such a holistic growth model  5G is poised to be the next game changer in the farming industry Today s Best Stocks from

The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
CTL currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 63  while USM has a forward P E of 32 18  We also note that CTL has a PEG ratio of 0 76  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  USM currently has a PEG ratio of 32 18

205308,426824,CTL,Telenav  TNAV  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Telenav  TNAV   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  6 75 in the previous session  Telenav has gained 63 8  since the start of the year compared to the 17 7  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 6 6  return for the Zacks Wireless National industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 7  2019  Telenav reported EPS of   0 06 versus consensus estimate of   0 12 
For the current fiscal year  Telenav is expected to post earnings of   0 43 per share on  214 17 million in revenues  This represents a 75 84  change in EPS on a 101 7  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn   0 28 per share on  236 01 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 34 88  and 10 2   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Telenav may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Telenav has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Telenav currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Telenav passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Telenav shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Telenav Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Telenav have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Gogo  GOGO   CenturyLink  NYSE CTL   and China Mobile  Hong Kong   CHL   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Telenav  Still  the fundamentals for Telenav are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-03-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/telenav-tnav-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200399390,200399390

What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes  a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment 
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency 
There are some investors  though  who think it s possible to beat the market with great stock selection  this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta  which track non cap weighted strategies 
Based on specific fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such  these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance 
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices  from equal weighting  one of the simplest strategies  to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility momentum based weighting  However  not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns 
Fund Sponsor   Index
The fund is managed by First Trust Advisors  FGD has been able to amass assets over  464 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs  This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index before fees and expenses 
This Index is an indicated annual dividend yield weighted index of 100 stocks selected from the developed market portion of the Dow Jones World Index 
Cost   Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF  and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 58   making it one of the more expensive products in the space 
FGD s 12 month trailing dividend yield is 5 54  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk  investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund  Luckily  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
Looking at individual holdings  Centurylink  Inc   CTL  accounts for about 2 23  of total assets  followed by Gamestop Corp   class A   GME  and Element Fleet Management Corp   EFN CT  
The top 10 holdings account for about 16 83  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
The ETF has gained about 6 13  so far this year and is down about  11 67  in the last one year  as of 01 24 2019   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  21 06 and  28 07 
The ETF has a beta of 0 81 and standard deviation of 13 70  for the trailing three year period  making it a low risk choice in the space  With about 102 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index Fund is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market  However  there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider 
IShares MSCI ACWI ETF  ACWI  tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF  VT  tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index  IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has  10 79 B in assets  Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has  12 46 B  ACWI has an expense ratio of 0 31  and VT charges 0 10  
Investors looking for cheaper and lower risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs

Coming into today  shares of the communications company had lost 0 4  in the past month  In that same time  the Computer and Technology sector gained 5 57   while the S P 500 gained 6 55  
CTL will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 13  2019  On that day  CTL is projected to report earnings of  0 36 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 100   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  5 80 billion  up 8 9  from the prior year quarter 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for CTL  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 64  lower  CTL currently has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell

205318,426834,CTL,CenturyLink  CTL  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This communications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 36 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  100  
Revenues are expected to be  5 80 billion  up 8 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 28  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CenturyLink 
For CenturyLink  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 77  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenturyLink will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CenturyLink would post earnings of  0 27 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 30  delivering a surprise of  11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CenturyLink doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/centurylink-ctl-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200384416,200384416

What s Next for CenturyLink 
While CenturyLink has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

205336,426852,CTL,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For CenturyLink  CTL ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering CenturyLink  NYSE CTL   which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this communications company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 12 08   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  CenturyLink came out with earnings of  0 30 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 27 per share  representing a surprise of 11 11   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 23 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 26 per share  delivering a surprise of 13 04  
Price and EPS Surprise

For CenturyLink  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CenturyLink has an Earnings ESP of  8 77  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 13  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-centurylink-ctl-200378490,200378490

OMAHA  Neb   Reuters    Katie Ryerson and her father took a train from their hometown of Columbus  Ohio  to Omaha  Nebraska  for her first  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa  shareholder meeting  a weekend the conglomerate s billionaire chief Warren Buffett calls  Woodstock for Capitalists  
They were part of a crowd expected to top last year s estimated 37 000  Shareholders filled the downtown  CenturyLink   NYSE CTL  Center s 18 000 seat arena  plus overflow rooms  on Saturday for the meeting itself with the man dubbed  the Oracle of Omaha  
 My dad bought shares of Berkshire for me when I was born   said Ryerson  a student at Michigan s Hillsdale College 
 It is amazing   she said in an exhibit hall where stockholders thronged to buy products made by Berkshire units   So many people are dedicated to the same thing  I m kind of overwhelmed  
Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger taught and entertained shareholders as they answered more than five hours of questions at the meeting  the weekend s main event 
It was also a time for many to shop and eat 
The Fruit of the Loom unit erected crowd control barriers after crowds overwhelmed its display area last year  A line to get inside early on Friday afternoon stretched 150 deep 
 Very interesting  like a carnival atmosphere   Les Magee  a retired accountant from Gainesville  Florida  who was attending his first meeting  said as he waited on that line   It s like Disney  because of the lines  
See s Candies sold most of the 21 714 pounds of confections it brought  And by the time doors were closing on Saturday afternoon  Dairy Queen was down to two boxes of unsold frozen treats  It had brought 25 000 dessert bars and Blizzards 
Buffett got his usual vanilla orange bar for free this year 
 We re always going to buy a few things   said Joseph Schwartze  a retired carpenter from Omaha  after he purchased Ginsu knives   We never go to the meeting  He starts talking about derivatives  and I would go to sleep  
Other shareholders get little sleep  As usual  several hundred lined up before daybreak on Saturday to enter the arena  many to get good seats 
They are not allowed to hold places once inside  But that is not the rule outside  where Mark Hughes  an investment adviser from Ashton  Maryland  attending his 26th meeting  said he got on line at 2 15 a m

The power to set the agenda and to frame the issues is more important than most understand  The punditry will not be explaining this in the week ahead  but they will be practicing it  By watching for it  or simply ignoring financial news  you can avoid the biggest current investment danger 
Don t Get Framed  
Last Week Recap
In my last edition of WTWA I asked what might disrupt the delicate balance of news  That was a good question  Despite plenty of discussion it remained unanswered during my vacation  Earnings are strong as are economic reports  The only changing elements are the subjects of tweets and assorted corporate issues 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I especially like the version updated each week by Jill Mislinski  She includes a lot of valuable information in a single visual  The full post has even more charts and analysis  including commentary on volume  Check it out 

The market was headed for a nice weekly gain until Friday s trading  The late day rebound held the week s loss to 25 bps  Despite the swingy chart the range for the week was only 1 3   I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in our Indicator Snapshot section below  Volatility remains well below the long term range 
In the same post Jill includes an update on drawdowns  This helps us see the nature of this rally   occasional declines even in the context of a major stock rally 

Personal Note
Mrs  OldProf and I enjoyed our trip  For me it had the customary effect of forcing my mind away from markets  It helped that our timing was good  the market increased by 1  while we were gone and maintained low volatility  Economic news remained solid  as did corporate earnings reports  If you were going to take some time off  this was a good choice 
I used some extra thinking time to consider priorities  I am committed to making sure that WTWA has timely information on broad themes as well as highlighting specific news and ideas 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
When relevant  I include expectations  E  and the prior reading  P  
New Deal Democrat s regular weekly review of high frequency indicators remains positive overall but has slipped to neutral for those in the long term forecast  A small change could send this forecast into negative territory 
The Good 

The JOLTs report reflects continuing structural strength in the labor market  The Washington Center for Equitable Growth has the best chart pack on JOLTs  The quit rate remains at historically high levels  positive  since this implies worker confidence in the job market   The Beveridge curve shows that conditions are at pre recession levels  With the tighter labor market  job openings are now yielding fewer hires 


Larry Williams  Daily Speculations  provides anecdotal support with a sign he is seeing everywhere on his travels  He notes that some include bonuses for immediate applications 

Business owners remain highly optimistic  David Templeton  HORAN  reports the data from Gallup  He notes that finding qualified workers remains the biggest challenge for small business owners 



PPI remains tame with a headline increase of 0 0  and 0 1  on the core  E  0 3 and 0 2  P  0 3  on both 
Initial jobless claims remain at record lows  this week only 213K 
Companies remain optimistic  Avondale Asset Management reviews transcripts from earnings calls and presentations  Their full report is loaded with excellent examples  Their overall summary 

Optimism abounds as the boom times in the economy persist  As a result  companies have lots of positive commentary and reasons to be excited  Despite this  talk of trade war hangs over the markets  Few people talk about risk  but history dictates that markets are cyclical  



The Bad 

Real wages have declined on a YoY basis  despite the increase in aggregate payrolls  New Deal Democrat highlights the 2 9  CPI increase and compares it to the gain of 2 7  of non managerial workers  He explains why the reported aggregate wage growth does not tell the whole story  Eddy Elfenbein observes that most of the increase came from more than six months ago  The July report registered a gain of 0 17   He notes   That s still tame  



Rail traffic was higher YoY  but Steven Hansen  GEI  notes that the rate is decreasing  Read his full post for deeper analysis  several sources  and plenty of charts 

Even the bad news this week was mostly neutral  Feel free to add items I missed in the comments 
The Ugly 
The biggest local news on my return was the violent weekend  There were 74 gunshot wounds  Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that  20 percent  of the 11 people who died due to gun violence last weekend were participating in a  large outdoor unsanctioned gathering    Fox News   Many gatherings grow rapidly via social media and some become gang targets 
There was a lot of political finger pointing last week  but little real substance  I suspect WTWA readers may not find Superintendent Johnson s 20  analysis to be very convincing 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar 
The calendar has important housing data  retail sales  and the preliminary August report for Michigan sentiment data  Important earnings reports continue 
Nothing seems more significant than the events that occurred in the recent quiet period  The delicate balance continues 
Briefing com has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme 
While I checked in during my vacation  I took time off from my intensive reading and stock research  There was plenty of important news  but the market reaction was muted  There was plenty of commentary  of course  but nothing fresh  The most important consideration for investors is how this might affect your personal choices  On Friday  someone asked me what I made of the day s action  There are better things to do than worry about a tweet with no policy specifics  related to a single country  and apparently leading to a move of less than one percent  One pundit got it right  It was a slow summer Friday in search of a story 
The financial news   at least for the moment   is not much about news  There is plenty of opinion  with few neutral sources  Everyone wants to set the agenda and to frame the issues in a way friendly to their viewpoint and business  If you understand this  it is the first step toward self protection 
Don t Get Framed  
Here are the most important misleading frames 

The bad driver  constantly watching the rear view mirror  Adherents of this approach believe the best way to determine future expectations is to look at the past  often an arbitrary period  This may include considering past earnings  past business cycles 
The anthropologist  who insists on humanizing the market  Statements like  This market is trapped in a narrow range and just wants to break out  provide no analytic content  Since most people believe they understand human behavior  but do not know much about group behavior  these statements have unwarranted appeal 
The announcer interprets daily market action as if it were a sporting event   The bulls need to hold 2820 or look out below  
The breathless newscaster exaggerates the importance of minor events or modest market moves   The Dow is 40 points off the low of the day  
The ideologue uses political viewpoints as a basis for finding investments  Just because a policy is endorsed by a leader you favor  does not mean that it will be effective  And vice versa

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Dr  Brett Steenbarger s post about the need for discipline  As usual  his audience consists of traders  but the logic is also important for investors  It is also a perfect fit for our theme  He begins with the idea that you must master your thoughts  If not  you will not be able to control your actions  After some helpful examples he notes the important stage of learning discipline 

Across performance activities we can see that disciplined performance is a necessary phase of development  The basketball or football player learns to follow a game plan  not just do what they feel like doing  The poker player learns to fold when the cards aren t right  It s common for developing psychologists to learn their craft from manuals that are research validated and that give them a game plan for helping people with various problems  Discipline is all about sublimating the ego to sound rules and principles 

Once you have a firm foundation  you can consider some exceptions

Abnormal Returns is an important daily source for all of us following investment news  His Wednesday Personal Finance Post is especially helpful for individual investors  There were many helpful links this week  ranging from retirement issues to how young people should get started  My favorite covered a topic relevant to many of my clients  blending some work with retirement  Morningstar s Mark Miller describes how you can reduce your overall workload and remain engaged  Extra income is helpful as well

Final Thoughts 
The best way to avoid the seductive pull of the carefully framed arguments is to develop an effective method  Then be disciplined in following it 
The selection method  Stick to fundamental valuation of your long term investments  You are not trying to outguess Mr  Market s latest mood 

The reward for stock ownership is a flow of earnings  Look forward in your analysis  If it is a cyclical stock  look for solid business cycle evidence to help your evaluation  Consider debt  competition  and business trends  Find stocks that are cheap on a price to earnings basis  In some cases  it is better to use cash flow or enterprise value  You can learn to do this  but it requires study and the willingness to follow a group of watch list stocks  You cannot merely follow tips  The tipster might not be around to tell you when to exit  Following Brian Gilmartin s excellent updates helps in this task  Anyone tracking his coverage of growth estimates has been on the right side of the market 
Compare your stock portfolio with other asset choices but do so carefully  Asking your list of  stock questions  about high yield bonds  rental property  or structured products is not easy  Do not take a stated yield at face value 

Analyzing risks   Understand the risk types and implications 

Headline risk is usually just noise  You can consider it if there are quantifiable impacts on the economy or corporate earnings  but not merely because it sounds bad  And  there are always those who will tell you that a certain event is  just the start  
Market volatility is often described as risk but is not actually important unless you need your investment funds very soon  You must expect declines of 15   20  in your stock portfolio as a part of long term investing  Look at the drawdown chart in today s introduction 
Recession risk and financial stress are important  These are almost always associated with the largest market declines 

Just as you have a method for evaluating potential investments  you need a process for risk recognition  That is the purpose of the Quant Corner in WTWA 
The example of the  bad driver  reminded me of a childhood experience with my dad  While I was not yet of driving age  he occasionally suggested some great techniques  We were rolling along a state highway with no stop signs or traffic signals ahead  There was little traffic  Suddenly  Dad hit the brakes  slowing before we passed an intersecting farm road  The vehicle on that road just blew through the intersection  ignoring his stop sign  Dad had spotted him a ways back and became suspicious  His risk recognition skills were great in many fields  In this case  it probably meant that I am here today to write about it 
 This is a crucial time for investment decisions  If you are flying solo  you might want to request my papers on risk or the top pitfalls for individual investors  If you are concerned that you do not have a good risk reward portfolio  or one suited to your needs  feel free to ask us for an analysis  For any of these just email main at newarc dot com

So far this year  shares of the company have gained 17 9   outperforming the  s 7 8  growth 

 
How Are Estimates Faring 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is pegged at  1 34 billion  indicating year over year decline of 9 3   Impacts of strategic decisions to exit long accounts and non profitable contracts  divestitures done in 2017  and adoption of 606 accounting standard are expected to continue weighing on revenues  In the last reported quarter  revenues totaled  1 39 million  down 7 3  on a year over year basis 
On the earnings front  the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 29 cents  reflecting year over year decrease of 31 8   This year over year decline can be attributed to drop in overall revenues  investment  primarily in our sales force   2017 divestitures completed in 2017 and the run off of the company s Student Loan business  In the last reported quarter  adjusted EPS of  29 cents rose 81 3  on a year over year basis

205364,426880,CTL,4 High Yield Landmines To Avoid At All Costs,opinion,"The stock market s up  so yields are down  And while there are still some generous payers available  be careful   some are paper tigers that will probably suffer this year 
That s exactly the danger that s facing four enticing high yielders  yielding up to 20    that I ll discuss with you shortly 
Since stock prices generally follow their payouts higher  it s important to remember the opposite also happens  When dividends get cut  shares get crushed 
I ve warned readers about Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  and its dangerous dividend for years now  Hopefully investors listened to me  because those that didn t lost  two ways    they lost their yield and they lost their capital 
The Danger of Dividend Cuts
Frontier s 2017 dividend cut   as well as its 2018 dividend suspension   are just one cautionary tale  The telecom s debts from buying Verizon s  VZ  wireline business  as well as a shrinking customer base  eventually forced FTR s hand  Declines came  then a cut to the dividend  followed by even more declines   and eventually the payout was wiped out altogether 
The following four stocks yield anywhere between 7  and 20   and all of them are potentially toxic to retirement accounts in one way or another  whether it s plain vanilla underperformance  or a serious risk of an eventual dividend cut 
Global X SuperIncome Preferred ETF  SPFF  SEC Yield  7 3 
Preferred stocks are a great source of safe  stable yield that trade more like bonds than stocks  But they re far from a guarantee of riches  and some funds just flat out get them wrong 
Take the Global X SuperIncome Preferred ETF  SPFF   for instance 
At a quick glance  SPFF isn t all that different from other preferred funds  It holds a basket of preferred stocks  a majority of which come from financial institutions such as Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   DB   That s par for the preferred course  It s even better in one significant way  yield  SPFF s 7  plus output is among the best in the space 
But this is a small portfolio of just a few dozen preferred issues  and it s very top heavy  with nearly a quarter of the fund s assets dedicated to the top five holdings alone  Also  the fund is hyper focused on yield   so much so that it delves into not so stellar preferreds to do so  More than two thirds of the fund is invested in junk grade preferreds  and it has been even riskier in the past  The small number of holdings helps amplify the effect of poor performances from any one issue 
That has led to a history of underperformance against even some of the most mediocre competition in the space 
Global X s SuperIncome Preferred ETF  SPFF  Is Far From Super
CenturyLink  NYSE CTL Dividend Yield  11 3 
The aforementioned Frontier isn t the only telecom that has gotten taken to the woodshed in recent years  While big telcos like AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  VZ  remain stable players  regional players such as CenturyLink  CTL  are having a difficult time 
CenturyLink is a Louisiana headquartered telecom that provides services such as home high speed internet  TV and phone  as well as business and government communications services  across 37 states  In fact  in terms of lines served  it s actually the No  3 telecom behind Verizon and AT T 
Some bulls are touting a turnaround story for CenturyLink due to its acquisition of Level 3 Communications  which admittedly did have a big impact on Q1 s top line  CTL reported a 41  year over year increase in revenues to  5 95 billion  But that s a natural effect from a bolt on acquisition  and that number in fact missed estimates of  5 96 billion  Meanwhile  higher expenses dragged on the bottom line  which dropped from 30 cents per share in the year ago quarter to just 11 cents 
CenturyLink at least is dredging itself out of the old wireline business and positioning itself more into high speed internet and business communications  But it pays out a dividend that it has not been able to cover with earnings for years  And while the picture is a little better when looking at the dividend versus its cash generation  it s still a tight fit that ensures the payout at the very least won t expand   and still may be a cut risk if the company itself can t organically grow 
CenturyLink s  CTL  Dividend Has Been Stretched for Years
Government Properties Income Trust  GOV Dividend Yield  12 2 
Government Properties Income Trust  GOV  is a REIT that  as the name suggests  owns 108 properties in 31 states and the metro D C  area  and leases them out primarily to federal and other government tenants  Roughly 90  of the company s rental income comes from governmental entities 
Investors also should note that GOV owns a 28  stake in Select Income REIT  SIR   which specializes in  strategic  single tenant properties  think corporate headquarters  
You d think that government tenants would translate into stability  but at the moment you d be wrong 
The company s occupancy at the end of 2017 was 94 2   down from 95 1  at the end of 2016  Moreover  Government Properties says about 5  of its annual base rent is likely to be lost to vacancies over the next 12 months 
It s not a pretty picture elsewhere  First quarter FFO shrank from 56 cents per share to 55 cents  and same store net operating income fell 1 2  year over year  The company is selling assets in an attempt to fix its balance sheet  and while AFFO still is enough to cover the dividend  that figure is shrinking while its payout remains the same 
Government Properties Income Trust  GOV  Is Drowning in the Swamp
CBL   Associates Properties  CBL Dividend Yield  19 7 
There s no hard and fast rule on what constitutes a  dangerously high  yield  but I think it s safe to say that anything yielding around 20  or more should be looked at with a skeptical eye 
Enter CBL   Associates Properties  CBL  
CBL   Associates is a retail focused REIT that specializes in suburban town centers  At first blush  this isn t the worst place to be in retail   rather than being a pure play on stores  its properties also boast dining  entertainment and even health   wellness businesses 
Still  its locations appear far from immune to the troubles plaguing the broader retail space  The company saw adjusted funds from operations shrink from  2 41 per share in 2016 to  2 08 per share in 2017  That s plenty of room to cover its 20 cent quarterly dividend  but about that payout   it s about 25  lower than the last time I discussed CBL 
Despite being able to cover its then 26 5 cent quarterly payout with AFFO  CBL   Associates slashed the dividend last year amid declines in its core operational metric  sinking occupancy and lowered full year guidance  For the full year  same center net operating income declined 2 9    driven by revenue declines of  20 9 million primarily due to lower occupancy and rent reductions related to tenants in bankruptcy  
First quarter earnings released in April didn t provide much additional encouragement  FFO sank from 52 cents per share to 42 cents per share  with total portfolio same center NOI declining 6 8   and portfolio occupancy declining a full percentage point to 91 1  
It s difficult to say that CBL is necessarily a dividend cut risk given that  again  it s generating about double the AFFO needed to cover it  But it already cut back once under a similar circumstance  and the REIT clearly isn t cleaning up its mess

205366,426882,CTL,2 Tips  And 4 Sells  To Protect You From Next Dividend Big Dividend Cut,opinion,"It s something I hear from readers all the time   Brett  the 7   dividends you recommend in the Contrarian Income Report service are well and good  but are dividends that high really safe to invest in  I m worried about a dividend cut  
The answer 
They are absolutely safe so go ahead and enjoy the outsized cash payouts delivered by our Contrarian Income Report selections  which I ve carefully chosen and safety checked to let you retire on a  500k nest egg  and maybe even less  
And for stocks outside of our portfolio  you just need to take a few quick steps to stay off the rocks 
I ll show you 3 time tested dividend safety tips today  Plus I ll name 4 deadly dividend payers you need to sell now  or avoid if you don t already own them  as we move through this article 
So let s get going  starting with 
Dividend Safety Tip No  1  Mind the  Correct  Payout Ratio
The payout ratio is the first stop many folks make when checking out a dividend stock  and it should be a slam dunk  it s simply the percentage of net income a company has paid out as dividends in the last 12 months 
So if that percentage is below  say  50   you re good  right 
Well  not exactly  Because way too many people are looking at the wrong payout ratio 
That s because the net income half of the ratio is an accounting creation that can be manipulated and often has little relation to the actual cash the firm is making  To get the real story  we need to look at the free cash flow  FCF  payout ratio 
FCF is a snapshot of how much cash a company is generating once it s paid the cost of maintaining and growing its business  You calculate it by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operating activities  you can find both figures under the  Financials  tab on Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance  
Which brings me to the first dividend that s undoubtedly on the chopping block right now  the sky high 6 6  payout at L Brands  NYSE LB   owner of Victoria s Secret 
If you own LB  you re already sitting on a 32  loss in the past year  while the rest of the market has gained 15   That s tough enough to take  but it gets worse  the lingerie peddler s payout is on borrowed time and when it goes  it s going to catch the herd completely off guard  pummeling the stock again 
That s because all those folks following the net income based payout have no idea  Sure  LB pays out 73  of profits as dividends  That s high  but not necessarily a sign of a looming cut on its own 
But the FCF payout ratio tells a far different story 
Key Indicator Flips From Yellow to Red
Over the last few months  LB has gone from paying a high but manageable portion of FCF as dividends to paying out more in dividends than it earns in FCF  It s a subtle shift that 99  of the herd has sleepwalked right by   and a blaring sign that if you hold this stock  you need to sell yesterday 
Dividend Safety Tip No  2  Backstop Your Payouts With Rising FCF
Even if you ve found a stock with a reasonable FCF payout ratio  you ll want to make sure the underlying free cash flow is stable or better yet rising so the payout ratio doesn t float up into the danger zone  like LB s has 
Because the truth is  just a few quarters of soft FCF can tip the balance fast and tighten the vice on the dividend before you even realize it 
Case in point  Tupperware Brands Corporation  NYSE TUP   which  like LB  had a high but still relatively manageable payout ratio 73  as of the end of the third quarter of 2016  Too bad FCF has fallen through the floor since  putting the dividend in big trouble 
Noose Tightens on TUP s Payout
So don t be fooled by TUP s 6 2  dividend yield  With slumping sales and FCF  this payout s headed straight for the waste bin 
Dividend Safety Tip No  3  Be Careful With Stock Screeners
You can save yourself a lot of work by going with a dividend safety screen like DIVCON  one of my go to tools for dividend stock research 
DIVCON uses a five tier rating system that provides a snapshot of dividend health for individual companies  It s offered as a free resource by ETF shop Reality Shares   You can access DIVCON s scores for free right here  
The test combines and weights seven factors  including cash flow  earnings growth and dividend history  to provide a snapshot of a company s dividend health 
DIVCON 5 is the best bucket  It means the dividend is in good shape  and there s a very good chance it ll be increased in the next year 
DIVCON 1 is the danger zone  It means the dividend is more likely to be cut than raised in the next 12 months  Current  DIVCON 1s  include two additional dangerous dividends I ve been warning you about for a while and am doing so again today  10 5  paying Prospect Capital Corporation  NASDAQ PSEC   which I last covered in May  and CenturyLink  NYSE CTL   whose thin ice 12 0  payout I sounded the alarm on  again  in early June 
But before you dive into a screening tool like DIVCON  keep in mind that for real estate investment trusts  REITs   net income and FCF aren t the best measures of performance  and dividend safety  
For that  you need to look at funds from operations  FFO   a metric some screeners simply aren t set up to deal with  causing them to flag REIT dividends as risky when they re actually safe  or vice versa   And some screeners  like DIVCON  may offer little if any REIT coverage at all 
That just means you have to check REIT dividend safety  the old fashioned way   by doing a quick dive into the last four quarterly earnings reports and paying particular attention to FFO 
Here s a Growing 4 9  Payout You Could Easily Miss
Consider Summit Hotel Properties Inc  NYSE INN   payer of a 4 9  dividend and a REIT I tapped for its high yield and fast dividend growth in a May 8 article 
Going by the net income  and FCF based payout ratios you ll find on a screener like Ycharts  you d think its dividend is headed for a haircut after all  it appears to be paying a dividend while generating negative FCF 
2 Misleading Dividend Safety IndicatorsSource  Ycharts com
But if you take a quick look back through Summit s last four quarterly earnings reports  you ll find a far different story  it posted adjusted FFO of  1 32 a share in all  while paying out just  0 69 in dividends 
The resulting 52  payout ratio is among the lowest you ll find in the REIT space and a rock solid indicator that this payout is safe and set to grow 
My Favorite 7 7  Dividend Payer Is Cheap But Not for Long
My top REIT pick for 2018 boasts a higher dividend than Summit Hotel Properties I m talking about an eye popping 7 7  cash payout 
What s more  this outsized dividend is as safe as they come and poised to grow as interest rates head higher  as I ll explain in a moment 
This company is a well connected commercial real estate lender that does all the work for us building a secure  diversified loan portfolio featuring offices  retail space  hotels and multi family units 
Management then collects the monthly rent checks  deposits them and sends most of the profits our way as dividends 
This REIT s mammoth 7 7  payout is easily covered by FFO  and its loan growth is soaring  setting us up for massive dividend hikes  too 
Big Loan Growth Today  Big Payout Growth Tomorrow
Plus if you re worried about rising rates  this is the stock for you  management has smartly eliminated interest rate risk by using floating rate loans  In fact  it s actually set up to make more money as interest rates move higher 
More Income as Rates Rise
And as its income and dividend march higher  they ll haul the share price right up along with them 
That s why I ve made this unsung REIT a cornerstone of my  8  No Withdrawal  portfolio  a collection of 6 investments from every corner of the market that I ve assembled to do two things 

Deliver a safe 8  average dividend  enough to pay you  40 000 in income enough for many folks to retire on a  500k nest egg 
Safeguard your retirement stash  letting you fund your golden years on dividends alone without drawing down your nest egg  This insures your retirement against a market meltdown and lets you leave a lasting legacy for your kids  and grandkids

205375,426891,CTL,Is First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index Fund  FGD  A Hot ETF Right Now ,opinion,"The First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index Fund  FGD  made its debut on 11 21 2007  and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the U S  equity market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes  a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment 
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency  market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns 
If you re the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection  then smart beta funds are your best choice  this fund class is known for tracking non cap weighted strategies 
Based on specific fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such  these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance 
While this space offers a number of choices to investors  including simplest equal weighting  fundamental weighting and volatility momentum based weighting methodologies  not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results 
Fund Sponsor   Index
Managed by First Trust Advisors  FGD has amassed assets over  518 99 M  making it one of the larger ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs  Before fees and expenses  FGD seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index 
This Index is an indicated annual dividend yield weighted index of 100 stocks selected from the developed market portion of the Dow Jones World Index 
Cost   Other Expenses
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds  assuming all other factors remain equal  it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF s expense ratio 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 58   making it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 4 03  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk  investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund  Luckily  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
When you look at individual holdings  Centurylink  Inc   CTL  accounts for about 2 33  of the fund s total assets  followed by Galliford Try Plc  GFRD LN  and Guess   Inc   GES  
The top 10 holdings account for about 15 31  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
FGD has lost about  0 59  so far this year  and as of 05 08 2018  was up about 7 83  in the last one year  In the past 52 week period  the fund has traded between  24 68 and  28 07 
The fund has a beta of 0 88 and standard deviation of 15 00  for the trailing three year period  which makes FGD a low choice in this particular space  With about 101 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index Fund is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market  However  there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider 
IShares MSCI ACWI ETF  ACWI  tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF  VT  tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index  IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has  8 45 B in assets  Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has  11 72 B  ACWI has an expense ratio of 0 32  and VT charges 0 10  
Investors looking for cheaper and lower risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs

205386,426902,CTL,What Lies Ahead For Telecom ETFs ,opinion,"U S  telecommunications industry had a disappointing 2017  However  signs of improvement were apparent from fourth quarter 2017 with most of the major telecommunications stocks starting to perform well  Notably  all four national wireless carriers have gained postpaid subscribers in the last reported quarter 
Upcoming 5G Wireless Network
Fifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U S  wireless carriers  We expect wireless networks to provide primary impetus to the telecom industry  In this regard  Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space 
Major Positives
Several positives emerged for the telecom industry since the last quarter of 2017  President Donald Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy   Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75  of all governmental regulations during his term as the President  We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change 
On Dec 14  2017  in a landmark decision  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission   FCC   repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime  There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC repeals Net Neutrality  Lenient regulatory attitude of current FCC may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies 
The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  would be immediately accretive to cash flowof the telecom carriers  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and deployment  
The telecom industry is highly capital intensive in nature  Therefore  the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible  intangible and real property  other than land  would significantly benefit telecom carriers  This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure  Major proposals such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years along with the above mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending

205412,426928,CTL,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  AT T  Verizon Communications  Comcast  Frontier Communications And CenturyLink,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 14  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Telecom  Part 1  including AT T Inc    NYSE T    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    Frontier Communications Corp    NYSE T   and CenturyLink Inc  NYSE CTL     NYSE T   Industry  Telecom  Part 1Link  After a lukewarm first half of 2017  most of the major telecommunications stocks performed well in the third quarter  The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  under President Trump has given indications of leniency compared with the Obama administration  The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime  Its stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions  which are likely to spur growth in 2018 Momentum to Continue in 2018A growing economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunications industry in an otherwise tough environment  This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom equipment manufacturers Additionally  a major characteristic of the industry is that it is immune to international geopolitical disturbances  even when these lead to economic fluctuations  The need to remain connected springs from our earliest tendencies to communicate with our fellow human beings  An era of digitization and technology is essentially built on this human craving  It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility  Consequently  any non U S  economic volatility is not expected to have an immediate effect on the industry Furthermore  Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  Major proposals    such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years  overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and easy regulatory policies    are likely to spur higher consumer spending that may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade  This  in turn  will fuel long term economic growth A Close Watch on Net NeutralityOn August 2017  the FCC closed the window for comments and replies after receiving 22 million comments on Net Neutrality rules  The regulatory body will examine these suggestions before taking a final call  Notably  in May 2017  the FCC voted 2 1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules In January 2017  Trump elected existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC  Appointing Pai as the head of the regulatory body appears to have put Net Neutrality back on the front burner as he is a staunch opponent of the measure Trump himself is also a strong critic of Net Neutrality  There is little doubt that if the FCC scraps its laws either fully or partially  the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary  Leading ISPs such as AT T Inc   Verizon Communications Inc  and Comcast Corp  decided to challenge the Net Neutrality laws in the Supreme Court  All three above mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Telecom   Media Convergence a Reality NowMassive growth of smartphones and tablets  along with continuous development of high speed data transfer technologies  has acted as a key driver of the convergence of the Telecom and Media sectors  Cable TV giant Comcast became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011  AT T is currently awaiting the regulatory approval for its proposed  85 4 billion cash and stock deal to acquire media giant Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX   Verizon has already acquired AOL and the internet based assets of Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  to establish a strong foothold in the Telecom   Media space  The company is also mulling over buying out any powerful media giant to remain competitive Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling  Pay TV operators are steadily adopting the data driven advertising technique that is already popular in the web based advertisement arena  To derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform  these companies are extensively penetrating the advertising technology market  Inclusions of dynamic ad insertion  targeted audience advertising and data driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective Wireline Industry   Going All Out on ConsolidationIn the last decade  U S  wireline phone companies have lost a significant number of customers to wireless service providers and cable multi service operators  MSOs   In order to tackle this critical situation  wireline operators have decided to merge to gain economies of scale with respect to fiber optic cable networking and cloud based network services  Meanwhile  small and medium business  SMB  services have become a high revenue generating segment in the data communications industry In April 2016  Frontier Communications Corp  completed the purchase of Verizon s wireline assets in California  Florida and Texas  Currently  the company operates landline business and provides broadband  video  voice and FiOS services in the three states  Recently  in a cash and stock transaction  CenturyLink Inc  has acquired Level 3 Communications Inc Pay TV Spending Continues to Rise in FutureIn June 2017  research firm Strategy Analytics estimated that annual spending on subscription video and TV services in the United States will reach  130 3 billion in 2019 Major pay TV operators  who offer both traditionally managed TV services and next generation online services  will have nearly 80  of the market share till 2022  They will continue to do so despite facing intensified competition from over the top  OTT  service providers The pay TV operator s average revenue is still 10 times higher than that of the online video streaming service providers Valuation Indicates Strong UpsideGoing by P E  price to earnings per share  valuation metrics  which is often used to value telecom sector stocks  the industry looks stable at this stage  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 15 79x  which is below the median value of 16 74x and the S P 500 s trailing 12 month P E ratio of 20 67x Additionally  the reading compares favorably with the market at large  as the current P E for the S P 500 is pegged at 20 48x and the median level is 19 40x  On the other hand  current P E of the telecom industry is 14 70x with a median of 15 33x  Therefore  at present  the telecom industry looks undervalued compared to the overall market  This indicates a near term upside potential for the stocks Another commonly used valuation metric for this sector is P S  price to sales  which also depicts the same picture  The industry s current P S of 1 46x compares favorably with the market at large  as the current P S for the S P 500 is at 3 40x and the median level is 3 10x Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little publicized and

205429,426945,CTL,Telecommunications Industry Outlook   November 2017,opinion,"After a lukewarm first half of 2017  most of the major telecommunications stocks performed well in the third quarter  The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  under President Trump has given indications of leniency compared with the Obama administration  The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime  Its stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions  which are likely to spur growth in 2018 
Momentum to Continue in 2018
A growing economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunications industry in an otherwise tough environment  This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom equipment manufacturers 
Additionally  a major characteristic of the industry is that it is immune to international geopolitical disturbances  even when these lead to economic fluctuations  The need to remain connected springs from our earliest tendencies to communicate with our fellow human beings  An era of digitization and technology is essentially built on this human craving  It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility  Consequently  any non U S  economic volatility is not expected to have an immediate effect on the industry 
Furthermore  Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  Major proposals    such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years  overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and easy regulatory policies    are likely to spur higher consumer spending that may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade  This  in turn  will fuel long term economic growth 
A Close Watch on Net Neutrality
On August 2017  the FCC closed the window for comments and replies after receiving 22 million comments on Net Neutrality rules  The regulatory body will examine these suggestions before taking a final call  Notably  in May 2017  the FCC voted 2 1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules 
In January 2017  Trump elected existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC  Appointing Pai as the head of the regulatory body appears to have put Net Neutrality back on the front burner as he is a staunch opponent of the measure 
Trump himself is also a strong critic of Net Neutrality  There is little doubt that if the FCC scraps its laws either fully or partially  the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary  Leading ISPs such as AT T Inc  NYSE T    T   Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    VZ  and Comcast Corp   CMCSA  decided to challenge the Net Neutrality laws in the Supreme Court  All three above mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
Telecom   Media Convergence a Reality Now

Recently  CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  and Level 3 Communications moved a step closer to complete their proposed merger after receiving approvals from almost 23 states and territories  The combined entity is likely to generate  975 million of annual cash synergies  Moreover  it is expected to be closed in the third quarter of 2017  subject to customary regulatory approvals 
Going forward  we believe this unit will be a formidable force in the fiber based metro Ethernet and Internet market 
Additionally  the company has launched its automated on demand Network as a Service  NaaS  with Adaptive Network Control Solutions  which is powered by Cisco System s Network Service Orchestrator  NSO  
Level 3 Communications  collaboration with Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  will enable the former to offer hybrid cloud connectivity  dynamic capacity with bandwidth of up to 300   optimized data backup and real time information on network performance and utilization 
Besides  on Aug 2  it posted strong second quarter 2017 results where the company s bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
However  Level 3 Communications has to compete with telecom giants like Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc    NYSE T   in North America and Telefonica  MC TEF   Orange  ORAN   BT Group  LON BT  and America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   in Europe and Latin America   Also  customer concentration  foreign currency exchange rate risks and global macroeconomic fluctuations are considered to be the other dampeners for the company s growth prospects 
Price Performance
Shares of Level 3 Communications have underperformed the  growth for the last six months  The stock price declined 0 5  against the industry s gain of 6 5  in the same time span

205441,426957,CTL,Verizon Communications  VZ  Adds Versa Networks To Portfolio,opinion,"U S telecom behemoth  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   has integrated Versa Networks to its software defined networking  SDN  solutions 
Notably  the company s motive is the expansion of managed services to a broader segment of small and medium businesses in response to rising demand for virtualized services 
In fact  Verizon s SDN solutions platform includes software based networking  cloud based end user management and virtualized security services that is used to simplify branch network architectures 
Interestingly  this telecom behemoth will use in its existing SD WAN services  Versa Networks  Versa FlexVNF  virtual network functions  Software  which combines networking and security functions in a single software to provide a suite of Layer 3 to Layer 7 IP services built on a cloud native  multitenant software platform 
Moreover  Verizon will help clients to condense complexity and manage costs by virtualising various components of a branch office  Additionally  public and private network connectivity management  wireless connectivity  multisite network support  application based quality of service and multilayered securities are considered to be other different components 
We note that Verizon s SD WAN vision has already gained market recognition 
Recently  to upsurge SD WAN service  Verizon allowed customers access to a new library of VNFs based on Cisco System Inc  s   NASDAQ CSCO   Virtual Managed Services  VMS  platform 
Furthermore  the company inked a managed services deal with Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   of late  wherein the latter will be deploying Verizon s Managed Software Defined Wide Area Network  SD WAN  for its corporate IT  The contract includes virtualized security services and Managed Enterprise Radio Access Network  E RAN  solutions  Per the deal  Ericsson will utilize virtualized network functions  VNFs  as a utility in a pay as you go model 
Earlier this year  Verizon s rival firm CenturyLink Inc    NYSE CTL   also decided to offer managed enterprise services in association with Cisco Systems Inc  s subsidiary  Cisco Meraki  in an effort to establish itself in cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions arena designed for enterprise customers

205442,426958,CTL,Here s Why You Should Dump CenturyLink From Your Portfolio ,opinion,"On Aug 25  one of the leading regional wireline service providers in the United States  CenturyLink Inc    NYSE CTL    was downgraded to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Shares of the company have underperformed the gain in the last month  The stock price decreased 12 3   as against the industry s gain of 2 6  in the same period 

Meanwhile  the company continues to face depreciation in its access lines on an organic basis  As a result  CenturyLink s core local phone business has slowed down significantly 
As of Jun 30  2017  total access lines were 10 733 million  down 5 95  year over year  This decline was mainly due to the substitution of traditional wireline telephone services by wireless and other competitive offerings  and lower long distance minutes of use 
Additionally  decrease in subsidy payments by the Federal Universal Service Fund  tough competition  federal regulations and labor union issues remain headwinds 
Notably  the dynamics of the communication industry are significantly governed by technological innovations  Therefore  changes in technology compel large investments that can dilute cash flow  This could substantially impact its ability to meet debts and other obligations  Alternatively  if CenturyLink fails to adopt new technology or network upgrades  it might result in greater subscriber loss to larger competitors  going forward 
CenturyLink s cash and liquidity position seems to be a major concern for the company  In fact  accumulating high debt levels and decreasing cash flows may pose threat to the company s margins in the near term 
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the broader  sector may consider better ranked stocks like Arista Networks  Inc    NYSE ANET    America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   and I D  Systems  Inc    NASDAQ IDSY    While Arista Networks currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   America Movil and I D  Systems carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   
Arista Networks has expected Earnings per Share  EPS  growth rate of 21 6  for the last three to five years  
America Movil has expected EPS growth rate of 55 87  for the last three to five years 
I D  Systems has expected EPS growth rate of 30  for the same time frame

	Chicago  IL   June 23  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include T Mobile US Inc   NASDAQ           CenturyLink Inc  NYSE CTL    NYSE           AT T Inc  NYSE T    NYSE           Comcast Corp   NASDAQ          and Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Telecom Stock Roundup  T Mobile US to Rollout 600 MHz Spectrum  CenturyLink May Face  12 Billion Lawsuit 

	The U S  telecom industry remained rather subdued over the last week  Nevertheless  a few developments were worth noting 

T Mobile US Inc   NASDAQ          the third largest U S  national wireless operator  has decided to roll out 600 MHz wireless spectrum across its operational region by this summer  In Apr 2017  the U S  telecom regulator  Federal Communications Commission  FCC  declared the winning bidders for its latest 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as    Incentive Auction  The company was one of them 

	Per a recent Bloomberg report  CenturyLink Inc   NYSE         might be charged with a fine cum damage recovery cost of  12 billion in response to a class action lawsuit  This was filed by the entire group of customers affected by the company s alleged sales incentive scheme 

	Notably  the new lawsuit can be linked to another case filed recently by CenturyLink s former employee  Heidi Heiser who alleged fraudulent practice by the company  The new lawsuit  filed in the Central District of California  includes Heidi Heiser s suit as well as similar accusations posted on social media and consumer review websites by those who accused CenturyLink of fraud  unfair competition and unjust enrichment 

	U S  telecom behemoth  AT T Inc   NYSE           and the First Responder Network Authority  FirstNet  together revealed customized buildout plans for states to consider for the first nationwide dedicated wireless network for first responders  States and territories will get 45 days to review the plans along with an opportunity to exchange feedback with FirstNet Authority  Following that a 90 day window will open for them to opt in or out of the project 

	Notably  in Mar 2017  AT T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America s police  firefighters and emergency medical services 

	Leading cable multi service operator and media giant Comcast Corp   NASDAQ          recently brought its various advertising technologies together under a new division   Advanced Advertising Group  This division will include all ad related technologies that it has acquired in last 12 years  along with its local cable ad sales business   Comcast Spotlight  The company has hired former Weather Channel executive  David Clark  to run the division  Comcast currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 

	Meanwhile  President Donald Trump recently announced that his administration will do away with many policies related to the communist state of Cuba  taken by his predecessor  Barak Obama  As a result  the previous regime s decision to normalize U S  diplomatic and economic relations with Cuba  which has been considerably strained since 1961  is under threat once again  This may hurt U S  national wireless operator s dream to expand operations in Cuba  Within last two years  all four major telecom carriers like Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE           AT T  T Mobile US and Sprint Corp  have launched services in that country 

	In a separate development  United States Cellular started offering a free iPhone 7 to those who switch to its network from rival carriers in a bid to attract new customers  This will further intensify the cut throat pricing competition within the U S  wireless industry

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  The Incentive Auction raised around  19 8 billion from 50 bidders who won nearly 2 800 licenses in total  Low band spectrum is essential for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  T Mobile US plans to extensively roll out 600 MHz spectrum later this year when new smartphones for this radio frequency are likely to be made available by Samsung  KS 005930  and other manufacturers   Read more    

	2  Discontent was expressed by existing customers of CenturyLink who complained about being charged more than what was quoted initially  The subscribers were often charged for services they never opted for  Some of the allegations mentioned that the company observed a monopolistic rule in certain areas of Alabama  The customers are of the opinion that this is an illicit move  The fine amount may vary from  600 million to  12 billion  based on its 5 9 million subscribers   Read more    

	3  As part of the 25 year contract  FirstNet will provide AT T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration  AT T will also be given success based payments of  6 5 billion in the next five years to design and build the network  The company is expected to spend around  40 billion over the life of the contract to build  deploy  operate and maintain the network  AT T has projected that this contract will create more than 10 000 jobs in the next two years   Read more    

	4  Cable TV operators are gradually adopting the data driven advertising technique which is already popular in the web based advertisement arena  To derive the maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform  Comcast is extensively penetrating into the advertising technology market  Inclusion of dynamic ad insertion  targeted audience advertising and data driven TV advertisements is a step toward the same objective   Read more    

	5  We believe that the U S  telecom operators may not reap any near term benefits from Cuban investments as the country is less developed at present and reels under highly restrictive government regulations  However  in the long term  Cuba may become a boon for those telecom carriers who choose to operate in the country  To sell products and services to 11 million untapped customers is a very lucrative and enticing opportunity   Read more    

What s Next in the Telecom Space 

	We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week  Consequently  we expect stocks to trade in line with the broader market 

Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside 

	Most of Zacks  investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more    

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

205452,426968,CTL,US Wireline Services Industry Going All In On Consolidation,opinion,"The U S  wireline telecom industry has been witnessing a surge in consolidation among major players due to an intensely competitive environment  Several mergers and acquisitions  M A  have been taking place over the last couple of years  In the past decade  U S  wireline phone companies have lost a significant number of customers to wireless service providers and cable multi service operators 
In order to tackle this critical situation  the wireline operators have decided to merge in order to attain economies of scale with respect to fiber optic cable networking and cloud based network services  Meanwhile  small and medium business  SMB  services have become a high revenue generating segment in the data communications industry 
Fiber optic cable network is a vital infrastructure to meet the surging need for cloud based business data  along with more video streaming services by individuals  Moreover  fiber optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop  which are needed by the wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network 
Yesterday  Cincinnati Bell Inc    NYSE CBB   announced that it will buy Hawaiian Telcom Inc  for  650 million and OnX Enterprise Solutions for  201 million  The company took the step to expand its network and enterprise IT services  The combined entity will have 14 000 route miles of fiber and access to an undersea cable connecting Asia 
Cincinnati Bell expects for the OnX transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2017  while the Hawaiian Telcom transaction will close in the second half of 2018  The company currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
In Feb 2017  telecommunications and data service firm Windstream Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ WIN   acquired EarthLink Holdings Corp  The deal will witness the incorporation of 29 000 fiber optic route miles from EarthLink  16 000 of which will expand Windstream s footprint  This will bring the total to 145 000 route miles of fiber optic  EarthLink Holdings will also bolster Windstream s SD WAN  software defined wide area network  suite 
In addition  on Apr 2017  Windstream entered into a  228 million deal to acquire Broadview Networks  a leading provider of cloud based unified communications solutions to SMBs  The company expects the acquisition to close in the third quarter of 2017 subject to necessary regulatory clearances 
In Nov 2016  CenturyLink Inc    NYSE CTL   and Level 3 Communications Inc    NYSE LVLT   entered into a definitive agreement  through which  the former will acquire the latter in a cash and stock transaction  The total deal size is approximately  34 billion including debt  The equity value of this deal is approximately  25 billion  The deal is anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2017  subject to customary regulatory approvals 
If the proposed merger finally materializes  it will increase CenturyLink s network by 200 000 route miles of fiber including 64 000 route miles in 350 metropolitan areas and 33 000 subsea route miles connecting multiple continents  The company s on net buildings are expected to increase by nearly 75  to approximately 75 000  including 10 000 buildings in EMEA  Europe  the Middle East and Africa  and Latin America  Therefore  a merged CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications will become a formidable challenger to their large counterparts 
In Apr 2016  Frontier Communications Corp    NASDAQ FTR   completed the purchase of Verizon Communications Inc  s   NYSE VZ   wireline assets worth  10 5 billion in California  Florida and Texas  Currently  the company operates landline business and provides broadband  video  voice and FiOS services in all the three states  Notably  half of the network runs on high quality fiber to the home  FTTH  technology  Frontier Communications will be able to use them as part of its service expansion drive and leverage the same to provide off net capabilities to its customers

205461,426977,CTL,CenturyLink Stock Gets Boost On Activist Investors  Bullish Take ,opinion,"Shares of CenturyLink  Inc    NYSE CTL   moved higher on Monday after activist investor Corvex Management LP voiced bullish support for the telecommunications company 
Speaking at the illustrious Sohn Investment Conference in New York on Monday  Corvex s Keith Meister said he thinks   The newly positive take from the hedge fund that owns roughly 5 5  of CenturyLink has sent its stock price up 4 43  to  24 65 per share 
Meister s confidence in CenturyLink stems from his faith that Level 3 Communications  Inc  s   NYSE LVLT   executive board can lead the company forward 
In Nov  2016  CenturyLink announced it is scheduled to acquire Level 3 in a  cash and stock transaction  The deal isn t expected to close until September  As of now  CenturyLink CEO Glen Post  the combined company  with Level 3 s CEO gaining a position on the board 
But in Meister s mind  the only way the deal will prove to be truly beneficial is if Level 3 s CEO Jeff Storey takes on a leading role in the soon to be merged company 
 Execution has been substantially weaker at CenturyLink than at Level 3 for many years   Meister said at the Sohn Investment Conference Monday  Meister also said the deal will give   which currently accounts for two thirds of its revenue  and boost its free cash flow 
 I ll say it simply  if you bought the New England Patriots  you d start Tom Brady  right   Meister said on CNBC   Let s get our best athletes on the field  
Meister hopes Storey will get an executive role of some sort before being named CEO sooner than later  The activist investor wants both current CEOs to play a large role in the business now before CenturyLink s Post eventually hands over the keys to Level 3 s Storey  
CenturyLink s stock has slowly fallen since December 2014 when it was trading at roughly  40 per share to its current  almost two decade low  The struggling telecommunications company is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Level 3 s stock has skyrocketed from its 2011 depths of  1 49 per share to its current  59 39 price  The company has seen its stock price jump 3  on Monday  Level 3 is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

205463,426979,CTL,CenturyLink Level 3 Communications Merger Faces Objection,opinion,"The much hyped merger between CenturyLink Inc    NYSE CTL   and Level 3 Communications Inc    NYSE LVLT   recently faced objections from two California based consumer advocacy groups as per a  report  The deal was opposed on grounds of consolidation of wholesale and retail fiber in one company  The consumer advocacy groups include TURN  The Greenlining Institute and the California Public Utilities Commission  CPUC  and the California Emerging Technology Fund  CETF  
Both companies provide communications services like data  voice and video transmission for large enterprises  Notably  Level 3 Communications is the provider of one of the largest Internet backbone in the world and the leading U S  fiber optic network service provider 
The completion of the proposed merger will increase CenturyLink s network by 200 000 route miles of fiber including 64 000 route miles in 350 metropolitan areas and 33 000 subsea route miles connecting multiple continents  CenturyLink s on net buildings are expected to increase by nearly 75  to approximately 75 000  including 10 000 buildings in Europe  the Middle East and Africa and Latin America  Therefore  the merged entity will become a formidable challenger to their larger counterparts 
The consumer advisory groups are keen on monitoring the merged entity s effect on other wireless operators and service providers in the long run  Meanwhile  the recent protests from Frontier Communications Corporation   NASDAQ FTR   and Windstream Holdings Inc    NASDAQ WIN   on accusing Level 3 Communications for unfair billing and payment practices  added fuel to the fire  The companies in protest are concerned that the larger merged unit may misuse their broader market power  hampering rural broadband deployment 
This came as a small hindrance for CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications  who might not have expected any type of distortions in getting state regulatory approvals 
In Mar 2017  both the companies moved a step closer to completing their proposed merger amid overwhelming approval of their shareholders  About 96 3  of CenturyLink shareholders and more than 81 2  of Level 3 Communications shareholders gave their nod to the deal  In Nov 2016  CenturyLink inked an agreement with Level 3 Communications through which the former will acquire the latter in a cash and stock transaction  Total deal size is approximately  34 billion including debt  The equity value of this deal is approximately  25 billion  The combined entity is likely to generate  975 million of annual cash synergies 
Despite the merger protests  CenturyLink remains positive in getting the other necessary state approvals and complete the deal by the end of third quarter of 2017  At the end of the first quarter of 2017  CenturyLink gained 14 state PUC approvals 
The price performance of both the companies amid such regulatory issues is encouraging  Shares of Level 3 Communications gained 3 0  but failed to beat the Zacks sub categorized  industry s growth of 4 6   over the past three months 

Meanwhile  shares of CenturyLink inched up 1 5  while the Zacks classified  industry contracted 5 0   over the same time frame 

Both CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

205464,426980,CTL,Frontier Communications  FTR  Set To Deploy Nokia s G fast,opinion,"Regional wireline telecom operator Frontier Communications Corp    NASDAQ FTR   is planning to deploy Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp  s   NYSE NOK   G fast technology in Connecticut  The technology is aimed to deliver gigabit speed broadband services to everyone living in apartments and multi dwelling units  MDUs  throughout the state 
The G fast node will help Frontier Communications bring ultra broadband access and fiber connections to each MDU basement location by utilizing the existing copper pair wiring in each apartment  Apart from saving time it will also be a hassle free process   Another additional feature of Nokia s G fast solution is that it automates the deployment process via SDN  Software defined networking  capabilities in compliance with NetConf and Yang models 
The G fast approach is expected to be a key element of broader copper network upgrade plan which will simplify the broadband installation and activation process in MDUs 
Why G fast 
Telecom operators are mainly focusing on increasing their fiber footprint  However  there are areas where fiber networks are yet to reach  Telecom operators look to provide alternate solutions to provide high speed Internet service through the existing copper networks  G fast is one such networking protocol that allows higher Internet speeds within a short range of the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier  ILEC   G fast is gaining popularity in the copper wired MDU market 
This marks a strategic business move on Frontier Communications  part as copper based G fast hasn t seen significant uptake among the telecom operators in the U S  A major portion of the country s broadband infrastructure is based on hybrid fiber coaxial networks  and a significant portion of copper networks have already been phased out in favor of fiber to the home or wireless alternatives 
The G fast technology is gradually coming into the limelight  Windstream Holdings Inc    NASDAQ WIN   has deployed the same in its multi dwelling units  MDU  in Nebraska in Jul 2016  AT T Inc  NYSE T    is reported to have shown interest in the technology as well  In Sep 2016  CenturyLink Inc    NYSE CTL   completed the rollout of the largest G fast standard in its copper DSL lines in Platteville  WI  The telecom operator has connected 44 apartments using Calix Inc  s  AXOS G fast solution  Notably  G fast works well in densely populated areas providing speeds of up to 1 Gbps 
We further believe that declining customer base can also be a reason that has compelled Frontier Communications to boost Internet speeds  As of Mar 31  2017  Frontier Communications had 4 164 000 high speed broadband subscribers  down 2 5  sequentially and 1 065 000 video customers  down 7   This is because a number of its carrier partners might migrate to Ethernet solutions at lower price points while some customers may switch to competitors  Thus  deteriorating wireless backhaul business is expected to remain a headwind for Frontier Communications 
Management expects this downward trend to persist in the near future  To this end  the G fast rollout in Connecticut will help Frontier Communications compete more effectively in the broadband sector  The telco is planning for further deployments on a broader scale 
Price Performance and Zacks Rank
Over the past three months  share price of Frontier Communications have declined by 58 66  while the Zacks categorized  industry contracted 32 11  

Meanwhile  share price of Nokia grew 23 55  while the Zacks categorized  industry gained over 6 31   over the same time frame

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

FCC to Scrap Business Service Regulations

	the U S  telecom regulator   Federal Communications Commission  FCC    voted 2 1 to withdraw most of the stringent regulatory requirements to reform the business data service  BDS  market  The BDS reform report was introduced by the previous FCC body that was led by Tom Wheeler under the Democratic rule  However  the new FCC  reconstructed by President Trump and headed by Ajit Pai  has ushered a less restrictive regime 

	The BDS market  where telecom operators and cable MSOs  multi service operators  provide a host of network related services to business entities of various sizes  has been a lucrative source of revenues in the recent years for service providers  Significantly  these service providers have been generating handsome revenues by frequently charging steep prices from small and medium businesses  At present  BDS is a  45 billion market opportunity per annum 

	In 2016  the FCC proposed rules to regulate pricing in the market  citing low competition  The proposals include   1  removal of tariffs  2  not classifying telecom providers as either dominant or non dominant carriers  3  implementing a new Competitive Market Test to determine where competition exists  4  imposing technology neutral regulations  5  instituting price caps on access to legacy TDM networks in non competitive markets  6  setting wholesale prices in relation to retail prices for any given service in non competitive markets 

	Yesterday s voting outcome will substantially ease the regulatory requirements in the business data services market  However  some price caps in areas with little competition will be retained  Welcoming the voting result  Pai said that stringent regulations would be detrimental to competition and future investment need for technological upgrade 

Gainers from FCC s New Decision

	The BDS reform proposals adopted by the FCC under the previous regime have been criticized by industry players and several industry organizations  They argued that being that the BDS regulations will cause more harm than good  discouraging further network investments  costing jobs and reducing economic output  Incumbent service providers like AT T Inc   NYSE           Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE           CenturyLink Inc   NYSE          and Comcast Corp   NASDAQ          together with several other telecom operators and cable MSOs  vehemently opposed this proposal  These companies are set to gain the most from today s FCC decision 

	On the other hand  the vote comes as a blow to Sprint Corp   NYSE          and other firms that backed a 2016 FCC plan under Wheeler s chairmanship that would have cut business data prices  All the stocks mentioned above currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

205479,426995,CTL,What Lies In Store For InvenSense  INVN  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"InvenSense  Inc    NYSE INVN    a leading provider of motion tracking devices  is slated to report second quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 3  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 15 38  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
InvenSense reported a weak fiscal first quarter  Also  management issued a weak fiscal second quarter guidance  which indicates poor demand in consumer and mobile markets 
For the fiscal second quarter  InvenSense expects total revenue in the range of  77  83 million  representing a sequential decrease of 32  at the midpoint  On a non GAAP basis  gross margin is likely to be 45 5  46 5  
Non GAAP income per share is projected in the range of 2 cents to 4 cents  while GAAP loss per share is expected in the range of 9 cents to 13 cents 
We believe that the company s growth initiatives including increased software content  market diversification and new sensors built are the positives 
Additionally  with technological advancements  demand for Internet of Things  IoT  devices  console and portable video gaming devices  digital still and video cameras  wearables  head mounted displays and navigation devices is growing  InvenSense s chips target all these product categories and hence should experience demand growth  in our opinion 
Increasing competition and uncertain demand patterns remain headwinds 
INVENSENSE INC Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that InvenSense will beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 5 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  InvenSense s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise

205494,427010,CTL,Winter Is Coming  Why Risk On Investing Is The Wrong Strategy Now,opinion,"For those who have been fast asleep since April 2011  or who simply haven t cared for the  Game of Thrones  phenomenon   Winter is Coming  was the title of Episode 1 of Season 1 of this mega hit  As one of our clients astutely observed  however  winter has now been coming for a full 5 years on this show 
Every Hitchcock fan knows the longer you prolong the denouement the greater the suspense and  in the case of serializations like Game of Thrones  the longer you can hook members of the public  There s a market analogy in here somewhere 
I predict that Game of Thrones  adapted from the books in the series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R R  Martin  will most certainly outlive the current market bull 
Having been told repeatedly by scores of analysts that  winter is coming  to this particular market and that the White Walkers will surely destroy the market  we can be forgiven if we have tired of their bearish chatter  So like most residents of the lands south of The Wall  many investors have decided White Walkers  and bear markets  are only myth and we should go on about our business of seeking wealth and the power wealth brings   Game of Thrones haters  you may read on  I promise to stop making references to the TV serialization or the books  
The point is that bear markets may still occur in our lifetime  At some point it behooves us to perhaps take some profits off the table  accepting the  possibility  that as much money might be made  going forward  in solid income producing securities  as might be gained by buying index funds and such  Indeed  if the bear is more than a correction and truly awakens from hibernation  such an approach might not only provide reasonable returns in times of turmoil but may actually protect capital so as to provide truly exceptional entry prices at some point a bit down the road  I place myself squarely in this camp 
Regular readers have seen a trend since we began to see our trailing stops execute at an accelerating rate in January and February  It seems ever clearer to me that mid 2016 is not likely to be a good time for  risk on  investing  Why not  There are many reasons  but for this article let me elaborate on two I have not discussed in as much depth in my previous posts on this subject  Both are strategic issues that must be addressed if the markets are to be trusted and the economy is ever to get out of the current government induced doldrums  I ll then provide some ideas for how to protect your capital in this environment 
Reason  1  Companies have for years been able to use pro forma rather than GAAP accounting  merrily buying their own shares back to goose the earnings  per share  figure and therefore give their managers massive bonuses  Some analysts think this is a good idea after all  it s only stock  not dollars  and the number of shares is diluted over so many shareholders that the dilution isn t as evident  But just as water flowing over a rock will not visibly alter it  over many years that rock will become  river rock   not only rounded but smaller 
It is the same with individual shareholders  holdings  Drip by drip  hired administrators and their favored cronies are making as much or more than those few with real talent  The dizzying escalation in executive pay  and worse  stock options  has made a mockery of corporate  governance   with a few at the top of public companies making hundreds or thousands of times as much as the workers in those companies  This practice is beginning to catch up to these firms as their boards of directors begin to realize their erstwhile golden boys  now retired with a similar colored parachute  have left the companies far behind in research and development and far behind in capital expenditures  They have paid massive capital draining salaries and bonuses and are now left behind the curve 
Now the current crop of administrators must now make hard decisions  Having paid up to and including top dollar for shares selling at new highs  they need to conserve funds for R D and CapEx or they will lose market share to those who spent their money more wisely  As this quarter s results so painfully show  for many large and once successful companies  top line revenues are down  earnings are down and  for those realizing they can t keep playing funny money games  even their earnings per share are down 
This leaves just one final illusion to perform  As quarter end approaches  they flurry to the Wall Street analysts who tout their shares and suggest the analysts  who want to look good to get their own bonuses  lower their quarterly earnings  estimates   This incestuous relationship ensures that the analyst looks good and both Wall Street and the reporting company can trumpet that  while revenues may have been down they once again beat the earnings estimates 
They can t really believe we re so stupid we don t notice the sleight of hand  can they  you ask  I respond  I assume your question is rhetorical  Not only do they believe it  but enough market players  I can t bring myself to call them  investors   swallow it hook  line  and sinker  that the game can go on  But by now  it is going on with decreasing volume  As more catch on  I fear for the aging bull 
Reason  2  Regulations and red tape are strangling American entrepreneurs  Are we becoming just another tired and bloated European style social welfare republic  The facts would support this argument  The American Dream of prior years is further and further out of reach of the average American  Red tape is now strangling the entire nation 
Do you wonder why the elites in the boardrooms and corporate corner offices  the White House  Congress  the Fed  the SES s   Senior Executive Service   administrators  etc  all tout how wonderfully the economy is doing while any cross country road or rail trip will show just how poorly  the rest of us  beyond the Beltway are doing  It s because  their  economy is doing fine  With what they make and who they associate with all doing exceedingly well  they just don t understand why the rest of the nation doesn t get it  We do  They don t 
They aren t trying to start or run private or growing businesses  or earn an honest day s wage for an honest day s work at such a company  In many cases  they aren t even subject to the onerous regulations they have imposed  They have their own  special  plans for special people 
I am indebted to a new study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University  whose authors  Patrick McLaughlin  Bentley Coffey  and Pietro Peretto  have put in dollar terms what those of us running a business or working for a living know  even Nazi Germany or Communist Russia never had this many regulations to run afoul of and  consequently  keep voracious government gorging itself on new fees  fines  licenses  lawsuits and taxes 
The Mercatus Center paper looked at regulations imposed since 1977 on 22 different industries  those industries  real growth rate  and what might have happened if all those regulations had not been imposed  Of course there have been benefits to some of these regulations  fines  fees  and so on  We have cleaner air  safer workplaces  more  though perhaps increasingly difficult to obtain  health care  etc  And I m sure we d all be happy to pay an extra  oh  call it a trillion dollars  for those benefits  But  4 trillion  including only federal regulations  not even counting the additional burdens imposed by states  counties  and cities  4 trillion dollars  That s how much we taxpayers have given up since 1977 to support the imperious and bloated federal bureaucracy 

The chart above shows that  if the economic growth lost to regulation in the U S  were its own economy  it would be the fourth largest in the world  That s not our GDP  it s not our debt  it s just our regulatory burden 
Are we descending to the third world model of central planning and economic misery  If ever there was a self inflicted wound  this is it  Our Code of Federal Regulations is now more than 81 000 pages long  It wasn t always this way  To cite just one example  in 1939  even after 6 years of the New Deal  our tax code consumed just 504 pages  Today that has mushroomed to 74 608 pages  Who can understand all of this  No one  Who gets to interpret little bits and pieces of it  Clerks within the bureaucracy and lawyers within and outside 
The problem has hugely accelerated since 2008  The George Mason study notes that President Obama has imposed 85 more  economically significant  regulations than did President Clinton and 100 more than President Bush   A total of 372 new pieces of suffocating red tape  172 during his first term and now  with the finish line of his vision in sight and an acquiescent Congress  200 more since then  
We need a complete zero based review of the cost and benefit of these mandates and dictates 
It could happen with the sweep of a new broom in November  Until there is greater clarity there  however  I ll take the  risk off  approach that allows our clients to sleep well with fine income holdings  Here are a couple we are currently buying 
A Fine Income Holding
Starwood Property Trust  NYSE STWD  is a commercial real estate lending  servicing and investing company  It is the largest commercial mortgage REIT in the U S  and one of the biggest and most successful in the world  yet its price has been under pressure lately  This may be because most people don t believe rates will rise again  ever     For whatever reason  I believe the current price of STWD offers us a unique opportunity to own a great company at a great price 
Formed as the 2007 09 recession ended  and taking full advantage of the decimated commercial lending landscape  the company has yet to lose a dollar  yen or pound in commercial lending  which comprises 61 3  of its total assets  Being formed when it was  the assumption must always be that rates will  someday  rise  That s why 82  of their loans are indexed to LIBOR  the interest charged will rise as LIBOR rises 

Because of its current low valuation  the share price has fluctuated between about 16 1 2 and 24 1 2 the past 52 weeks   STWD currently yields an excellent 9 9  yield  That s not unusual for mortgage REITs but it is unusual for one of this heritage and quality  Despite the rebound as a result of somewhat improved investor sentiment toward high yield stocks  Starwood Property is still down so far this year  It sells for just above 10x earnings  a hair above book value  enjoyed a return on equity  ROE  of just under 13  in the last reported quarter  and sells at a stellar 7 4x operating cash flow 
I need to remind readers that what you are buying with a mortgage REIT is cash flow  Unlike equity REITs  100  mortgage REITs have no opportunity for capital appreciation  Their stock may appreciate based on under valuation  increased cash flow  or a favorable change in investor sentiment  but the company basically makes lending decisions and collects payments on the money they have lent out  Of course  how smart a company is in assessing and assigning risk is key  In Starwood s case  their  loan to value  hovers right around 63  and consists primarily of first mortgages 
In other words  if they believe a purchase  renovation  or other activity will create an asset value of a billion dollars  They might loan  630 million 
I think Starwood may benefit from all 3 possibilities I cite above for their stock to appreciate  Now the kicker  while STWD has 61  of its assets in commercial mortgage lending  the other 39  is in small equity positions and servicing fees for other lenders  They have the scale to service loans cheaper than many originators do 
All this leads me to believe there is an additional possible wind at Starwood Property s back and that is a dividend increase  With cash flow numbers like these and the likelihood that  in Europe  rates will not go further negative but begin to come back above zero  I think increased cash flow from all segments will mean an increase in the dividend  The company can afford it now and  as a REIT  it must pay at least 90  of its earnings as dividends 
Finally  because of Dodd Frank induced  risk retention  rules  which force more firms to keep a portion of whatever they package as mortgage backed securities  I see the number of competitors falling off over the next year or so  This places Starwood Property Trust in a great position  It has the experience  the head start and the right management team to be able to capitalize on the shrinking number of packaging sponsors 
A Fine Income Holding  Part II
Preferred shares might well lose value in a protracted bear market  In which case  we would simply add more  As long as they are bought at or below par and they are issued by companies with a future we believe to be secure  we ll always get that nice  steady return  Bought below par  the return is better  of course 
Every now and again the market will seriously over react  as it did in late 2008 and early 2009  and provide us with a cornucopia of delightful offerings  I purchased one such one time good deal on March 6  2009  by chance  not prescience  the absolute lowest day of the entire decline   I purchased  to provide some ballast for the Aggressive Portfolio  500 shares of Silicon Valley Bancshares 7  preferred   25 par value  NASDAQ SIVBO  for  10 a share  At the time  the prevailing panic was that all banks would go belly up  I figured if any survived it would be a bank that catered to the best innovators 
It worked out  I list SIVBO s current yield as 6 9  since it sells for a little above par now  But on a  yield to cost  basis  we are getting 20  a year in interest on this preferred  If it never moves a penny in capital appreciation  and there is little reason it should  over the past 7 years we have received  4900 in interest on our  5000 investment and now own something worth an additional  12 850  These opportunities don t come along often but when they do  when the markets look bleak  hearken back to this article and take the plunge 
Regrettably  I find no such bargains in preferreds today  It seems everyone has caught on to their benefits  But I have been buying a speculative preferred that is  at least  slightly below par  It is the Qwest Corp 6 125  Notes due 2053  NYSE CTY  a synthetic preferred in that it is really a piece of a bond  It is callable at par  in this case   25  anytime after June 1  2018 by the parent company  Because it is part of a bond offering  the income is classified as  interest  and not as a  dividend   These notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company and will rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company 
Qwest doesn t exist as an independent company any more  It was purchased 100  by CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  The CenturyLink website refers to itself as 

 A global communications  hosting  cloud and IT services company enabling millions of customers to transform their businesses and their lives through innovative technology solutions  CenturyLink offers network and data systems management  Big Data analytics and IT consulting  and operates more than 55 data centers in North America  Europe and Asia  The company provides broadband  voice  video  data and managed services over a robust 250 000 route mile U S  fiber network and a 300 000 route mile international transport network  

So it isn t AT T  NYSE T  or Verizon  NYSE VZ   but neither is it a small fry  It operates in a tough neighborhood but  so far  seems to be holding its own  I think the company is a fair bet to last in its various niches  It has assumed the responsibility to repay the  preferred  shareholders of CTY at maturity  Currently selling for  24 70  we buy when we can  Of course  that goes for all preferreds we favor   below par  we ll nibble  well below par we ll back the truck up 
Basic  Boring  Dull and Profitable
Owning a merger and arbitrage mutual fund or ETF is every bit as exciting as watching paint dry on a too cool day  But they do reward us with small but steady profits in most market environments  And they tend to be almost completely uncorrelated to what happens in the general markets  while still allowing us to benefit from extraordinary events in the markets 
Among the funds I have researched  Vivaldi Merger Arbitrage  VARAX  has been rising to the top  My first caveat is that this is a load fund  It is waived for those broker dealers and others who have an agreement with Vivaldi to waive the load for  among others   Registered Investment Advisors  the theory being that we will  for our clients  quickly reach the zero fee breakpoint anyway  So for our clients  and maybe your advisor  there is no fee 
VARAX provides a dose of what we want for the immediate future  low to no correlation with the market and low volatility during what I believe will be volatile times  Merger and arbitrage  M A  funds don t buy companies they think  might  be taken over or  hope  will be acquired  Instead  they purchase the stock of a company which has already announced it is being acquired  the  target  company  while at the same time shorting the stock of the company acquiring the target s stock  The fund profits from the difference in price between the current trading price of the target company following the announcement of the merger  which is usually  close  to the acquisition price   and the acquisition price to be paid for the target company at that future point when the acquisition is consummated 
In other words  VARAX is betting that the spread between the price the target jumps to on the news and the price ultimately paid for it justifies their time and attention  Often  of course  even if the deal falls through  there is a contractual fee paid to the target if the acquiring firm is forbidden by the regulators or finds it really wanted a different company or can t get financing or whatever  In this case  I particularly like the experience level of the principals in knowing  when to hold  em and when to fold  em   And I like what the following two charts so clearly show 


It s always  always about risk and reward  You can t really compare an M A fund to the S P 500 when it comes to performance in a bull market  But performance over time is another matter  As you can see VARAX compares  quite favorably  to both bonds and the S P  More importantly  given my concerns for the next few months  is where it falls on the risk continuum  which is to say  it barely registers  We are buyers 
I also see opportunity for income investors from the exodus of smart money from China and other less stable  over regulated regimes in Asia  That will be the subject of my next article

Past performance is no guarantee of future results  rather an obvious statement but clearly too often unheeded judging by the number of investors who buy the current  1 mutual fund one year only to watch it plummet the following year 
I encourage you to do your own due diligence on issues I discuss to see if they might be of value in your own investing  I take my responsibility to offer intelligent commentary seriously  but it should not be assumed that investing in any securities my clients or family are investing in will always be profitable  I do our best to get it right  and our firm  eats our own cooking   but I could be wrong  hence my full disclosure as to whether we or our clients own or are buying the investments we write about  ",2016-05-16,Joseph L.

Telecom Stock Roundup

The U S  telecom industry remained rather subdued last week despite the fact that almost all key stocks traded in the green  Nevertheless  a few developments were worth noting 

The 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as Incentive Auction  kicked off by the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  on Mar 29  2016  recently completed its first part 

In the first part  which is essentially a reverse auction  the airwaves are being freed by TV broadcasters who no longer have any productive use of the same  The TV broadcasters have agreed to free a substantial amount of 126 MHz of spectrums for a massive  86 4 billion In the second part of the auction process  the FCC will resale these airwaves to wireless operators  cable MSOs  multi service operators  or tech firms through competitive bidding  The second part is known as forward auction 

U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc     has announced its plan    AT T THANKS    to reward customers  The move came on the heels of its rival  T Mobile US Inc  s     similar but far more generous  Get Thanked  offering  As part of AT T s plan  the company will be giving out movie tickets as freebies every week  Additionally  the company has tied up with Live Nation Entertainment  Inc     to gain access to tickets for select concerts before they are made available to the public 

Regional wireline operator CenturyLink Inc     has acquired certain core networking assets from a company formerly known as Active Broadband Networks Inc  CenturyLink has been focusing on shifting its network and shift network functions to the cloud for its business customers by providing software defined networking  SDN  and network functions virtualization  NFV  services  The acquisition is in sync with this strategy and is expected to enable the company to accelerate its top line 

Meanwhile  thriving WiFi networks throughout the U S  have become a major concern for large wireless operators  Currently  cable MSOs have deployed more than 500 000 public WiFi hotspots  This exceeds millions if WiFi homespots are also taken into account  Research based website Heavy Reading stated that growing transmission of high speed data  voice and video packets through wireless networks are prompting cable TV operators to explore the wireless business

205511,427027,CTL,The Telecom ETF Landscape,opinion,The U S  telecommunications industry is presently riding a growth trajectory and the momentum is likely to continue in 2015 as well  Telecommunications is one of the few industries to have seen rapid technological improvement even during recession  Owing to the significance of telecommunications as an infrastructure product  we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in the industry s favor  Unprecedented growth in high speed mobile Internet traffic  in particular of wireless data and video  has transformed the industry into the most evolving  inventive and keenly contested space  Any new network standard aims at providing faster data connectivity  quick video streaming with high resolution and rich multimedia applications  The rising demand for technically superior wireless products has been the silver lining for the telecom industry in an otherwise tough environment  The ongoing Advanced Wireless Servies 3  AWS 3  spectrum auction being conducted by the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  has accumulated a record breaking  44 89 billion  Unexpectedly high bidding for AWS 3 Spectrum clearly indicates that telecom operators expect the demand for mobile data and video services to rise in the future  The FCC also plans to conduct a broadcast incentive  spectrum at the hands of TV broadcasters  auction in 2016 to ease the pressure on wireless operators  The spectrum license winners from different regions will upgrade their respective networks to gain a competitive edge Key Attributes for 2015  1  The telecommunications industry is known for its huge barriers to entry  Deployment of high speed network infrastructure requires significant capital expenditure  which very few entities can afford   2  The sector is immune to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe  A potential slowdown in China or any non U S  economic fluctuation will not have any immediately impact on this industry   3  U S  telecom carriers have the option to expand globally through acquisitions or partnerships as several emerging nations are installing 3G and 4G networks rapidly   4  We expect telecom carriers to continue paying handsome dividends in 2015 as well  In 2014  eight major telecom and cable TV operators have paid an average dividend yield of 4 7   Apart from traditional telecom services  carriers can also offer value added services  such as securitized data management  cloud computing  mobile banking to name a few  These new offerings will generate considerable growth for the companies   5  We may see more product sharing deals between telecom  cable TV  and satellite TV operators as each of these players are trying to gain a foothold in the other s territory  Even  pay TV services  offerings to business enterprises  mobile backhaul and metro Ethernet segments may witness more convergence  ETFs to Tap the Sector Against this backdrop  investors seeking to tap the growth potential of the highly competitive telecom sector may take a closer look at the ETF approach to reap maximum benefit from investing in this sector  This technique can help to spread out assets among a wide variety of companies and reduce company specific risks for a very low cost  Below  we highlight the ETFs in this sector in greater detail for Telecom ETF investors iShares Global

205517,427033,CTL,CenturyLink Inc   Like Deja Vu All Over Again ,opinion,NOTE  Yogi Berra must have had CenturyLink Inc   CTL  in mind when he made his now famous quote  This is exactly the same recommendation I made on August 16  which triggered on September 4 and exited on September 7 to avoid the dividend liability  That trade although not stellar was a gain of 2 52 percent in just a few days  I believe we are presented with another opportunity to collect 2 to 5 percent quickly  Since this is the exact same trade I am presenting the article as it appeared on August 16 when I first published it  The chart and the block data matrix have been updated to include the blocks which were the impetus for revisiting this trade CenturyLink  CTL  is poised to move lower  There are certain indicators which lead me to believe a decline is imminent  In fact  it may have already begun  Therefore  my caveat to investors  never chase a stock  including this one  If we miss the move  that is fine  There will always be another opportunity If you have read the Manifesto  then you know that I like to use Japanese candlesticks in my charts  I would like to highlight a few candlestick formations which I found interesting in this issue On August 1 there is a Shooting Star  although the candlestick body is a bit longer than usual  On August 9 there is a more pronounced Shooting Star Doji On August 14 there is a Bearish Engulfing Candlestick  albeit slight  The Candlestick of August 14 also resembles a hanging man with a short wick As you should already know Doji  pronounced the same singular and plural  are bias neutral  That is to say  they are neither bearish nor bullish  However when occurring at the top of a sustained advance  as is the case in this issue  most chartists consider it a bearish signal  With regard to the Moving Averages  Notice that every time the spread of the 10  20 and 50 day Moving Averages widens the price declines  Additionally it typically takes place to the accompaniment of heavy aggregate volume or large blocks  The spread is currently very wide and large blocks have traded  In my mind this has all of the elements of a setup  Even though these patterns and indicators are sufficient cause for some traders to establish positions  I believe that by themselves they are not  You need to witness large block trades  Having seen the large blocks and a confluence of indicators gives me cause to believe that the decline is underway  I believe that the block of August 1 was a combination of a distribution and a short  There are many additional blocks in the 1 and 2 million share range that are not included in the block data matrix  It appears to me  that CenturyLink has been extensively distributed and shorted at these levels  The Designated Market Maker will need to replenish his inventory  Since he has unilateral control over price  where he decides to reset his wholesale price level is at his sole discretion  Although I expect this reset of the wholesale price range to occur at a much lower level  where exactly the DMM decides to reverse the trend will most probably be determined by where investor tolerance levels are exceeded and they  tap out   capitulation   If and when this happens it will be in connection with a block in excess of 7 million shares  On the basis of the foregoing  these are my views and observations  The Trade  I recommend establishing a short position in CenturyLink  Open you position with only   of whatever capital you intend to commit to CenturyLink at  42 78 or better  Purchase the remaining   of the position at  46 20 and stop out at  48 01  Do not post your stop loss  I have said it before but it is so important that at the risk of being redundant and in an abundance of caution I will say it again  It is too easy for the Designated Market Maker to cash investors out by moving the price above or below your stop out and move the price right back up or down again  In addition  when a stop out is triggered it converts into a market order and that could be disastrous if the DMM decides to really take advantage  Remember the  Flash Crash   I would be looking to exit this position with a downside price target of  40 38  There is always the possibility that the trade may not work out  There Is Never A Sure Thing  particularly on a short   Investors must realize and recognize that there is never a sure thing  Sometimes events that have a low probability of occurring bring forth very serious consequences should they come into being  Investors must judiciously consider what the inherent practical limits are and how much they stand to gain in relation to the risks involved in establishing any position  In addition  persistence can become desperate folly by allowing a losing position to become a viable argument for deciding on a new position  Rather  such decisions should be based on the current and soon to be circumstances  Any position in which one unexpected factor has a significant impact on your portfolio is the result of poor planning  It is a fault most commonly associated with people who want to explain away their losses  SUN TZU   Art of War  Use an attack to exploit a victory  never use an attack to rescue a defeat   If you follow the process recommended and the trade does not work  the overall loss in this model is  3 000 00  That amounts to  003 of the overall portfolio  theoretically valued at  1 000 000   Finally  never be a brave and brainless investor because a fool and his money are soon parted  A portfolio of  1 000 000 should position size in the following manner  This is a trade  not an investment  Be ever vigilant  That s it for now   Have a nice day Disclosure  This is a trade  not an investment  Be ever vigilant
