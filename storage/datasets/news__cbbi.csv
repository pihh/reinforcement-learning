6657,228172,CBBI,Will Cyrus One Be The First  Hot IPO  Of 2013 ,opinion,Each year  the IPO market grinds to a halt from about December 15 to January 15  Investment bankers apparently like to celebrate the holidays  too  Given that it s now January 17  it s time for them to get back to work  And sure enough  five companies plan to go public this week  At first glance  CyrusOne  CONE  stands out as the most compelling of the bunch  It s a newly formed REIT that owns datacenters and rents them out to blue chip companies  including nine of the Fortune 20 and 108 of the Fortune 1 000  As such  it s operating in the sweet spot of the  big data  boom  Remember  by 2020  IDC expects the amount of data that businesses handle to balloon 44 fold  And all that data needs to be stored somewhere  Of course  being tethered to a confirmed hypergrowth trend doesn t mean we should automatically invest in a company  We need to be a tad more particular  With that in mind  let s run CyrusOne through our gauntlet  That is  the  that we previously identified  If CyrusOne doesn t measure up  we shouldn t bother with the stock when trading begins tomorrow  No matter how much hype surrounds the deal  So let s get to it   Hot IPO Hallmark  1  Age The older and more established a company is when it goes public  the better the stock tends to perform  And at first blush  CyrusOne s SEC filings suggest that the company is less than one year old  founded on July 31  2012  But it s actually been around for over a decade  run as a separate unit of Cincinnati Bell  CBB   Management recently decided to spin off the operations as a separate entity  Long story short  despite appearances to the contrary  CyrusOne passes our age requirement   Hot IPO Hallmark  2  Verifiable Growth Opportunity An IPO is an investment in the future growth of a company  So the company better be growing   and positioned to keep growing  CyrusOne passes muster  In the last quarter  revenue increased 22   As for the future  given the enormity of the Big Data boom and the resulting demand for storage  the only thing that can hold back CyrusOne s growth is its ability to secure physical real estate to build datacenters  The good news  It s sitting pretty in terms of space to develop  In addition to its 1 63 million net rentable square feet  NRSF   the company is developing vacant properties and new facilities to add another 379 000 NRSF in three attractive markets  It has about 762 000 NRSF of space that s powered  connected and ready to be developed to a client s specifications  Plus  it s sitting on 146 acres of land to build even more datacenters on   Hot IPO Hallmark  3  Revenue Research from University of Florida professor  Jay Ritter  shows that shares of companies with more than  50 million in sales before they go public perform best in the aftermarket  CyrusOne easily meets this requirement  Over the last 12 months  the company generated over  210 million in sales   Hot IPO Hallmark  4  Profitability As I ve said countless times before  share prices ultimately follow earnings  And IPOs are no exception  As for CyrusOne  it s been profitable on an annual basis since 2009  Although results for the fourth quarter of 2012 aren t in yet  the company is on track to report another year of profits  That is  if we strip out one time impairment charges related to a 2007 acquisition of GramTel  Given capital spending in excess of  100 million each year  there s ample opportunity for the company to keep increasing its profits as it brings more available space online   Hot IPO Hallmark  5  Valuation The most important factor for investing in IPOs is valuation  We never want to overpay  In this case  it s easy to determine a fair value range for CyrusOne  because another similar sized datacenter REIT is already publicly traded   CoreSite Realty Corp   COR   CoreSite is a solid proxy  too  It operates about the same amount of datacenter space  1 2 million NRSF   generates about the same amount of revenue   197 million  and is increasing sales at a nearly identical rate  21  in the last quarter   Based on CoreSite s price to sales  P S  ratio  CyrusOne should be worth about  10 90 per share  Since we re dealing with REITs  price to earnings ratios aren t relevant  Remember  REITs must pass 95  of their income on to shareholders  so they shouldn t be showing big profits  Instead  we focus on funds from operations  FFO   Based on CoreSite s price to FFO ratio  CyrusOne is worth about  10 25 per share  Add it all up  and the proposed pricing range for CyrusOne of  16 to  18 looks a bit steep  If I compare CyrusOne to larger datacenter REITs  a valuation up to  20 per share can be justified  But that still doesn t leave much room to profit if the stock begins trading at  18  Bottom line  Wait to see if a more attractive entry point materializes  below  12 per share   It might not  But if it does  we ll definitely be getting a bargain  At the same time  we ll be earning a higher yield  too  As a REIT  CyrusOne plans to pay an annual dividend of  0 64 per share  which represents a 3 6  to 4  yield based on the proposed price range  That s in line with CoreSite s yield of 3 6   But if we can scoop up shares for  12 or less  CyrusOne s yield would top 5   which is much more attractive  So be patient and don t overpay  If a price drop never materializes  don t worry about it  With more than 115 IPOs in the pipeline  we ll have plenty of opportunities to profit in 2013  Speaking of which  we already singled out three potential  hot IPOs  to track in 2013 in our special report   All you have to do to access the free report is click   ,2013-01-17,Louis

6658,228173,CBBI,Reminding CBB s Management Who They Work For,opinion,Cincinnati Bell  CBB  will celebrate 140 years since its founding this July  It has long provided phone and data communications to residents and businesses in Ohio  Kentucky and Indiana  We have been invested in them for the tiniest sliver of their history  and today endured our very first quarterly earnings release  We were lambs to the slaughter The bull case on CBB is that they own a data center  CyrusOne  CONE  which represents an undervalued asset  Although their fixed line business is in decline  they have been investing in the data center and in January sold 31  of the company in an IPO  The 69  of CONE that CBB retains is itself worth  975MM  more than the market cap of CBB itself The genius in the CONE IPO was that it relieved CBB of the need to continue funding CONE s CAPEX allowing CBB to pay out excess cash flow as dividends while raising enough capital for the independent datastorage business to self fund growth  The  390MM of EBITDA that CBB expects to generate in 2013 should need to cover even less capex than 2012 for its legacy business and even after interest and pension fund contributions ought to provide for  100MM to be distributed to shareholders  Since CBB doesn t pay a dividend  even a  0 25 cent annual dividend   50MM  on a  4 25 stock would provide almost a 6  yield and draw in dividend investors to drive the stock higher  The once ophan stock of the legacy telco that pays no dividend while investing in datastorage becomes appealing to income seeking investors while their investment in CONE is rewarded in the market by REIT investors seeking growth But instead  the company disclosed in its earnings release that it projects 2013 capex at  180 190MM for the non CONE businesses  The equivalent number in 2012 was  140MM  so they re increasing their investment into a declining business  The value creation they promised with one hand through the CONE IPO is being hijacked by management with the other  In addition to which  they re paying certain employees  40 50MM in  IPO success payments   So far  those are the only people who have made any money out of the IPO Fortunately we were not bold and our investment was very small  indeed  smaller after today s rout   The good news is that the equity in CBB s remaining business excluding the 69  of CONE they retain is valued at negative  320MM  That s how the market assesses their decision to quicken the pace of fiber optic investments and the odds that they ll generate a return above their cost of capital So now it s over to the activists to impose a taste of corporate democracy on a management team that s lost the plot  As of December 31 holders included Marcato Capital Management  Gabelli and Lonestar Capital Management  Assuming they retain an investment they can t be happy with today s developments  The IPO Success Fee especially grates  We re holding our small position in the knowledge that more value exists than the company s current valuation implies while we await a 13 D filing  It might well be an interesting story to follow ,2013-02-28,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reminding-cbb’s-management-who-they-work-for-157028,157028
