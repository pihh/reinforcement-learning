One of Itron s biggest goals is to help create highly effective  non wasteful  Smart Cities  through the use of technology and  in particular  the Internet of Things 
 The addition of Silver Spring brings more capabilities to our offerings and advances our strategy of delivering highly secure  value generating solutions for the critical infrastructure within utilities  smart cities and the broader industrial IoT sector   Itron CEO Philip Mezey said in a statement

A shareholder rights law firm already started an investigation to see if Silver Spring s board broke their fiduciary duties by accepting this deal  The law firm cited a  19 a share Wall Street price target which is almost  3 more than they agreed to be sold for and noted that the company has no long term debt as the biggest reasons for the possible shareholder rights lawsuit 
 Smart Cities  and energy efficiency will prove to be a major piece of the IoT market  For more on the IoT market  including insight into another potential application for the technology  check out

Additionally  lucrative prospects in pharma and clinical end markets bode well for the company in the upcoming quarters  Further  Danaher believes that it is well positioned in the biopharma business  which will prove conducive to operating profit and bottom line growth for the third quarter 
Moreover  the company s aggressive acquisition strategy is proving to be a strong profit churner  and is expected to boost top line growth in the quarter under review  The company also expects core growth rate to accelerate going forward  in light of improving order trends and recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex 
Phenomenex has meaningfully enhanced Life Sciences portfolio  and is anticipated to help the company achieve a double digit return on investment in less than five years  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Life Sciences   Diagnostics business in the to be reported quarter currently remains high at  1 403 million compared with second quarter reported revenues of  1 384 million 
Furthermore  the company s constant focus on introduction of products to penetrate new markets has enabled it to gain competitive edge over peers  Further  Danaher remains optimistic about core revenue and earnings growth  on the back of improving order trends and its operating culture  Danaher Business System   DBS    Historically  DBS has contributed to meaningful core revenue growth  adjusted earnings per share improvement and cash flow generation

Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

25724,247239,ITRI,Tap These 5 Value Stocks With Exciting EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,Investors generally tend to get fixated on the price to earnings  P E  strategy in their quest for stocks trading at attractive prices  The ratio is broadly considered by value investors as a useful yardstick for assessing the fair market value of a stock  But even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its pitfalls What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Alternative The widespread popularity of P E stems from its simplicity  But a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer image of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E just considers a firm s equity portion Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first component of the multiple  EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents The other element  EBITDA  gives a better understanding of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more alluring it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  For this reason  EV EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks sporting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive Moreover  EV EBITDA is a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  The ratio also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is not devoid of limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  It varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Thus  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can club it with other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are five of the eight stocks that passed the screen The Greenbrier Companies  Inc    NYSE GBX   is a leading supplier of

generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks sporting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive Moreover  EV EBITDA is a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  The ratio also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is not devoid of limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  It varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Thus  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can club it with other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1

25950,247465,ITRI,Tin Price Forecast  Miniaturization  Lead Use To Affect Demand ,opinion,According to the International Tin Research Institute  ITRI   the main negative feature of future tin demand and consumption  covered by several speakers  was the impact of miniaturization and the trend away from wave soldering on electronics solder volumes   Valentijn van Velthoven of Alpha Asia is quoted as forecasting that cyclical recovery in electronic equipment production could result in 6 7  industry growth rates in 2014 2015  but area growth in printed circuit board production  which the company had found correlated closely with solder sales  might only be 1  per year   Countering this is the likely positive impact of increased use of lead free alloys in telecommunications  automotive and medical applications  which are collectively estimated to account for 34  of the market  in the coming years   It was noted that the prospect of a move from voluntary to mandatory restrictions on lead use in the China consumer products market from as early as July 2014 would also have a positive impact on tin demand   Clearly the situation is a dynamic one  On balance  the restricted supply market in the world s largest consuming country  coupled by increased demand from new applications  will likely outweigh the effects of miniaturization to lift prices over time   New mine supply is slowly coming on stream  but the majority of projects do not reach commercial production and the supply market remains constrained  Higher prices will be required to keep exploration and development ongoing the question is  when will the uplift come  While the outlook is not bright in coming months  it is more positive further out   As in the case of many of the base metals  the markets are waiting for signs of stronger industrial growth by Stuart Burns,2013-05-15,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/tin-price-forecast:-miniaturization,-lead-use-to-affect-demand-166989",166989
25981,247496,ITRI,Un Beta Portfolio III  The 1 Way To Stay  Long  In A Down Market,opinion,"This is the third and final installment detailing our  Un Beta Portfolio   You can see earlier installments here and here 
Our Un Beta Portfolio is designed to protect your capital but still have a capital gain possibility  no matter what the market itself does  In the first two installments  we discussed preferred shares  municipal bond ETFs and funds  and undervalued high yielding REITs 
Now let s talk about how we go long in this portfolio  No one knows if this market will continue to move ahead or stall out  But I think it bears considering a bit of perspective on what we mean when we discuss  this market   With a capitalization weighted index like the S P 500  the market can consist of deceptively few issues and provide a poor benchmark against which to measure your own results 
In 2015  for instance  four S P tech stocks Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   the  FANGs   were responsible for  450 billion of growth in market cap  Pretty wonderful  You don t remember that  You thought 2015 was a wasted year in terms of gains  with the S P 500 finishing almost flat 
You re correct  But the four stocks above did contribute  450 billion in market cap growth  That s because  as a group  the other 496 stocks in the S P collectively lost even more in capitalization  If you owned just the four FANGs  you had a mighty fine year  If you owned none of them  but all the others   not so much 
Let s use AMZN as an example  Amazon s market capitalization today is over  325 billion  larger than the combined market values of Walmart  NYSE WMT   Target  NYSE TGT   and Costco  NASDAQ COST   These three  old economy  firms reported trailing twelve month GAAP net income of just under  17 billion  while Amazon s net income was  an underwhelming  328 million  Of course  I think we can all agree that we buy stocks for what we believe they will be worth in the future  and I imagine Amazon the company will show increasing revenue in the future  However 
As of today  Amazon trades at 501 times earnings per share  While I believe AMZN will continue to earn more revenue every year and may translate that into earnings  if the PE it is rewarded with for that future growth slips to only  say  400 times earnings per share without any increase or decrease in actual earnings  that would mean a 20  drop in stock price from 626 to 501  Heaven forbid if  in a down market  it would slip to only 300 times earnings  that would take the share price in this example to 375 
It gets worse  As of April 1  2016  the aggregate price earnings ratio for stocks in the small cap Russell 2000 index is zero  those 2000 stocks  taken as a group  effectively had no earnings over the past 12 months 
On the off chance that current valuations  combined with current revenues and real earnings  might not end well  we placed roughly half our assets into the above mentioned yield and fixed income alternatives 
But of course there is a sucker born every minute and we ve seen greater fool markets before that lasted beyond any reasonable connection to reality   It seems the supply of Greater Fools is bigger than anyone imagined back in  say  1998   So in the event this one does continue  roughly half our asset base is still long   sort of 
Just as for Mr  Clinton  for whom it depended on what your definition of  is  is  our portfolio is long  depending on what your definition of  long  is  My definition consists of the following 

 Flexible funds   These are long only funds with excellent flexibility to go to cash  select different sectors or asset classes  or choose different capitalization sizes  world markets  or cash while awaiting reasonable entry points 
 Long   short funds   These are funds whose charter allows them to go long the issues they believe offer the greatest return or defensive characteristics and simultaneously short those they believe are most vulnerable to a decline 
 Liquid Alternative funds   Liquid alternative funds come in all sizes and flavors but their basic premise and promise is that they don t limit themselves to buying common stocks  so they are an  alternative  to the benchmark investing so in vogue these days  as it always has been after a few years of good general market appreciation   They might invest in or short currencies  commodities  bonds  stocks  options  futures or any of a half dozen other offerings 

Author s Note  What follows are all mutual funds  with the exception of one ETF  That s because  really  there are no ETF or closed end alternatives to these  If you disagree  and can offer constructive suggestions for appropriate alternatives  we d welcome your comments below 
Our favorite flexible funds are those offered by Leuthold Weeden Capital Management  These are all no load funds  have good track records  and are helmed by managers that are both transparent and humble  By  humble  I mean lacking in hubris and quite candid about their mistakes as well as their successes  Fortunately for us  the latter have outnumbered the former  The two we have in our portfolios are Leuthold Core Investment  LCORX  and Leuthold Global  GLBLX  
Here s LCORX  in their own words  from the Leuthold Funds website 

 The Leuthold Core Investment Fund differs from most other mutual funds by investing in stocks  bonds  money market instruments and certain foreign securities  When appropriate  as disciplines dictate  the Core Fund may also hedge its market exposure  We adjust the proportion of each asset class to reflect our view of the potential opportunity and value offered within that sector  as well as the potential risk  Although there are no guarantees  it is our belief that successful investing demands skill both in making money and attempting to preserve any gains 
 Flexibility is central to the creation of a core portfolio that you can depend on in a variety of market conditions  We possess the flexibility and discipline to invest where we see value and to sell when we believe there is undue risk  

Most recently  LCORX has been 18  in various bonds  52  in select sectors  and 17  hedged  with the rest in cash and smaller positions  In a rip snorting bull market  I d go more for aggressive funds like former holding Akre Fund  AKREX   For this market  nothing beats LCORX 
Leuthold s sister fund for global investing  GLBLX  is invested in a similar ratio  but with an global bent  holding a little less cash and a few more longs  I consider these two funds as fine bookends for a conservative defensive portfolio 
Then there are funds that are long only and equities pretty much only that simply refuse to buy anything unless they have great faith in the future of a particular company and can buy it at a reasonable valuation  If they can t  they stick to cash and cash equivalents  The best example of such a fund today is the Intrepid Endurance Fund  ICMAX  which is currently holding a whopping 67  in cash 
They ve experienced significant outflows  of course  because too many investors who claim they are in it for the long haul really aren t  Indeed  today s typical investor  institutional and individual alike  just want to beat the S P   basically every month and certainly every quarter  The best way to do that is to not beat the S P at all  but to at least equal it 
That s why so many gurus advise that you just buy an index fund and never sell it until you retire  at which time you can sell part of it to buy bonds 
I say phooey to that hooey  Cap weighted index funds like the S P 500 are  by their very nature and composition  avenues to buy a chunk of whatever s been working most recently  regardless of valuation or quality  The highest capitalization stocks get the most money newly devoted to purchases and lower capitalization stocks  regardless of their investment value  get the least 
Then we have most  professional  investors  a term that merely means that they do it from 9 to 5 every day  not necessarily that the do it more professionally or better  Their livelihood  vacations  mortgage  and children s higher education depends on them never under performing the index their mutual fund  pension fund or whatever is benchmarked to  See even most allegedly  active  managers never stray too far from the benchmark  As we get closer to a real bear market bottom  I m guessing it is the managers of funds like ICMAX that we ll be suggesting for your due diligence   because that s when they will be buying at  finally   reasonable valuations 
Moving on to long short funds  let me remind you about Boston Partners  Robeco  Global Long Short  BGLSX Institutional   BGRSX Retail   Since the fund publishes its largest holdings monthly  in an age of advanced information technology  why don t more funds do this      I can see that as of 31 March their biggest longs were Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOG   Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Imperial Brands  OTC IMBBY  and Philips Kon  NYSE PHG   Their biggest shorts were on Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Ball Corporation  NYSE BLL   GEA Group  OTC GEAGY  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   In uncertain times  I like this kind of flexibility 
We also own the Boston Partners Long Short Research fund  BPRRX Investor class   BPIRX Institutional class   As of 31 March  its biggest long holdings are Parsley Energy  NYSE PE   Oracle  NYSE ORCL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   The largest short positions  Itron  NASDAQ ITRI   National Instruments  NASDAQ NATI   Texas Roadhouse  NASDAQ TXRH   Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  and Wipro  NYSE WIT  
And finally  we own another long short fund  the AQR Long Short Equity  QLEIX   This one has beaten all the benchmarks this year so far but be aware     of this caveat about this fund family  all classes of all their funds I own have a  1 million or  5 million minimum purchase  depending upon class of issue  unless you buy through an RIA or financial advisor with an agreement with the fund company 
Fortunately our firm has such an agreement so we can buy in quantities as low as  10 000  See if your broker or advisor can do the same 
It s important to gain this edge because my best choice in the liquid alternatives area is the  managed futures  fund called AQR Managed Futures Fund  AQMIX institutional   AQMNX investor   This fund provides a liquid alternative to solely relying on US stocks for your returns  It does so by investing in a combination of stocks  bonds  commodities and currencies across a spectrum of different time frames  It provides virtually zero correlation with the S P 500  yet it gives us the ability to profit from global macro investing trends in over 100 markets   Indeed  this fund alone has proven so popular to our readers that we recently lowered our assets under management minimum from our standard  500 000 to  100 000  as long as we manage only mutual funds and ETFs  
Finally  we can offer  for those who prefer ETFs to mutual funds  one long which we own  the QuantShares US Market Neutral Anti Beta ETF  NYSE BTAL   It is basically a hedge fund  packaged as an ETF  that places the bet that boring predictable value will out perform the S P in any down market  BTAL shorts the highest Beta stocks  those that move in concert with  or at a greater rate than the benchmark  and buys the stocks least sensitive to the benchmark move  the lowest Beta stocks  
BTAL s aim is to mute market moves over time and protect capital far better than simply buying an index fund  BTAL actually has a lower correlation to the S P 500 than other typical hedges than either gold or utility stocks 
You can see why I placed the word  Long  in my headline in quotes  We re still long  We are long some things and short others but on balance long  And we may not be in equities  but we re still long other assets  Finally  we re long   but not too much  And we are invested with managers we know and trust and have given them free rein to rebalance the percentage long and percentage short 
This may give them some sleepless nights  Us  Between our munis  preferreds  REITs  flexible funds  long short funds and liquid alternatives  we sleep very soundly  thank you

26075,247590,ITRI,Tin Prices  Production Struggle in Spite Of A Market Deficit,opinion,The tin price has suffered the same loss of momentum seen in other base metals  as global growth has been stubbornly slow and the European debt crisis  if not worsening  shows no signs of improvement   Tin s price weakness is all the more surprising when you consider the constrained nature of the supply markets  both in Indonesia and top refined metal producer China  Global tin production slipped to 230 000 metric tons last year  from 244 000 tons in 2011  according to a Resource Investing News article quoting the U S  Geological Survey  The drop in production was due mainly to new government pollution controls  lower tin prices in the first half of 2012 and lower production in China due to drought   According to the article  by the middle of the year  over 100 small mines and processing operations had been shuttered in Kafang and Gejiu  Yunnan  in order to reduce pollution in the Hong and Mekong rivers   In a recent statement  the International Tin Research Institute  ITRI   reports the closure of small mines may have been relaxed  While China s refined tin production in January February was 21 430 tons  down by 2  compared to the same period of 2012  mine production increased by 18  to 13 329 tons  according to the latest data from China Nonferrous Industry Association   The rise in mine production is partly due to a revival in Guangxi  ITRI reports  Perhaps to counterbalance the rise in domestic production  China s imports of refined tin in February were down sharply by 51  compared to January  and 69  year on year to 1 145 tons  according to ITRI   Total refined tin imports in January February were 3 495 tons  down by 35  y o y   The World Bureau of Metal Statistics paints an equally subdued market picture for last year  indicating the tin market recorded a deficit of 2 300 tons in 2012  yet total reported stocks rose last year  ending December at 33 700 tons  3 800 tons higher than in December 2011   Almost all recorded stocks are now held in Asia  the WBMS reports  The rise in stocks and fall in prices comes in spite of global reported production of refined metal  excluding re processed LME metal  being down 10 200 tons in 2012  compared to 2011   In the medium term  new uses for tin are likely to sustain demand as tin s use in electronic solder applications is tempered by rising electronic production  yet lower per appliance use  A laptop uses less than a desktop PC  and a tablet or smartphone uses even less than a laptop   Prices could find support this year from a higher Indonesian tin purity standard  which comes into effect in July  The new benchmark could result in a 24  drop in Indonesian tin shipments this year  according to Resource Investing News sources  Previous restrictions in Indonesian exports have supported prices  but with exports running above levels normally seen during the Q1 rainy season  it will require a marked turnaround in Q2 to lift prices  by Stuart Burns,2013-04-16,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/tin-prices,-production-struggle-in-spite-of-a-market-deficit-163262",163262
