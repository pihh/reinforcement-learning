200711,422227,COG,U S  Natural Gas  Weekly Analysis Of The EIA Inventory Data,opinion,The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a smaller than expected decrease in natural gas

sentiment is unlikely to last and the commodity is expected to give way to pressure from rising production  As it is  following the report  the U S  moved to a surplus relative to its five year natural gas supply average A Considerably Smaller DrawdownStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 44 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Jan 3  below the guidance  of 50 Bcf fall   The decrease was also lower than last year s drop of 81 Bcf and the five year  2015 2019  average net shrinkage of 156 Bcf for the reported week The latest withdrawal puts total natural gas stocks at 3 148 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    521 Bcf  19 8   above 2019 levels at this time and 74 Bcf  2 4   over the five year average Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged 100 4 Bcf per day  edging up 0 6  on a weekly basis due to increased shipments from Canada even as dry production remained essentially unchanged Meanwhile  daily consumption rose 9 4  to 114 1 Bcf compared to 104 3 Bcf in the previous week primarily due to stronger demand from the power and residential commercial sectors Futures Shrug Off the Bearish EIA Report on Colder Weather

Gas Still Suffers From Severely Depressed PricesNo major commodity had a worse 2019 than natural gas  The fuel endured a torrid year  registering its worst annual decline since 2014  Prices tumbled more than 25  last year  falling to multi year lows of around  2 1 per MMBtu in between  as buyers fled the market over growing worries about record output and concerns of an ongoing supply glut The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 37   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand   But thanks to soaring shale output  the United States has been the world s largest natural gas producer since 2009  Higher recovery rates from major unconventional fields have helped unleash record volumes regularly  As a matter of fact  the EIA forecasts that the United States is likely to have produced 92 1 billion cubic feet a day  Bcf d  of dry natural gas in 2019  up from the 2018 average of 83 4 Bcf d   a record high for the second consecutive year  The agency also projected that domestic gas output would rise to an all time high of 95 1 Bcf d in 2020  In other words  record high production in the United States and expectations for healthy growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand Expect Price Volatility on Weather and Storage LevelsNatural gas might experience short lived surge based on positive weather forecasts but any powerful turnaround looks unlikely at the moment  With gas output in the lower 48 states recently

200731,422247,COG,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Cabot  COG ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Cabot Oil  COG   This company  which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This independent oil and gas company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9 02  
For the last reported quarter  Cabot came out with earnings of  0 36 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 33 per share  representing a surprise of 9 09   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 67 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 73 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 96  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Cabot  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cabot currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 05   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-cabot-cog-200476928,200476928
200732,422248,COG,Cabot Oil  COG  Q3 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Cabot Oil  COG  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 29 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 27 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 25 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 41   A quarter ago  it was expected that this independent oil and gas company would post earnings of  0 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering a surprise of 9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Cabot  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  posted revenues of  429 11 million for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 62   This compares to year ago revenues of  545 17 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cabot shares have lost about 17 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Cabot 
While Cabot has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cabot was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 31 on  504 05 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 68 on  2 14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States is currently in the bottom 30  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cabot-oil-cog-q3-earnings-top-estimates-200477973,200477973

are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Natural Gas Prices Kept in Check by Soaring ProductionThe U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a smaller than expected increase in natural gas supplies  which led prices to be squeezed up  with an added push in the wake of favorable short term temperature prediction  But the positive sentiment is unlikely to last and the commodity is expected to give way to pressure from rising production Supplies Grew by 49 BcfStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 49 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Aug 9  below the guidance  of 54 Bcf gain   However  the increase was higher than last year s increase of 35 Bcf for the reported week and in line with the five year  2014 2018  average net injection The latest rise in inventories puts total natural gas stocks at 2 738 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    357 Bcf  15   above 2018 levels at this time but 111 Bcf  3 9   under the five year average Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged 96 Bcf per day  unchanged on a weekly basis as dry production remained flat  Daily consumption also remained essentially flat at 86 6 Bcf with 86 8 Bcf in the previous week on static power generation demand Prices Edge UpThe natural gas futures market rose following the smaller than expected climb in U S  supplies  with the commodity posting a 3 8  weekly gain and erasing some of the steep losses that have taken it to lows not seen since May 2016 earlier this month  Weather forecasting models predicting hot temperatures in certain regions of the Lower 48 U S  states that would drive up the air conditioning demand for natural gas also helped lift prices higherHealthy Supplies to Restrict Major ReboundThe demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 35   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand  However   high production in the United States and expectations for healthy  through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements ConclusionNatural gas might experience short lived surge based on positive weather forecasts but any powerful turnaround looks unlikely at the moment  With gas output in the lower 48 states recently hitting a record 92 1 Bcf per day  there is little room for prices to improve meaningfully from their current levels of around  2 20 per MMBtu     Gas Focused Equities Out of FavorThe bearish natural gas fundamentals and its seasonal nature is responsible for the understandable reluctance on investors  part to dip their feet into these stocks Moreover  most natural gas heavy upstream

at 3 205 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    444 Bcf  16 1   above 2018 levels at this time but 47 Bcf  1 4   under the five year average Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged 97 5 Bcf per day  up 0 6  on a weekly basis as dry production inched up to 93 1 Bcf per day from 92 2 Bcf per day  Meanwhile  7  less gas flowed into the country from Canada On the other hand  daily consumption was down 2 2  to 81 3 Bcf compared to 83 1 Bcf in the previous week primarily due to lower power sector demand driven by mild temperatures in the Northeast U S  This was partly offset by increased deliveries to LNG export terminals and higher residential consumption Futures Move LowerThe natural gas futures market slumped following the bigger than expected climb in U S  supplies  with the commodity posting a 5 9  weekly loss and erasing most of the steep gains over the past few weeks associated with warmer weather and higher cooling demand  Futures for November delivery also fell after weather updates showed forecasts of mild temperatures in a number of regions of the Lower 48 U S  states that would hamper the demand for natural gas this upcoming winter heating season Strong Supply Growth to Outpace Increase in DemandThe demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 37   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand   However   high production in the United States and expectations for healthy  through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements Investors Should Wait for a Better Time to Build a PositionNatural gas might experience short lived surge based on positive weather forecasts but any powerful turnaround looks unlikely at the moment  With gas output in the lower 48 states recently hitting a  92 8 Bcf per day  there is little room for prices to improve meaningfully from their current levels of around  2 4 per MMBtu The bearish natural gas fundamentals and its seasonal nature is responsible for the understandable reluctance on investors  part to dip their feet into these stocks  In fact  the commodity fell to lows not seen since May 2016 last month Moreover  most natural gas heavy upstream companies like EQT Corp   SilverBow Resources  Inc

200781,422297,COG,Cabot Oil  COG  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Cabot Oil  COG  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 34 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  161 5  
Revenues are expected to be  497 06 million  up 9 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17 57  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cabot 
For Cabot  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cabot will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cabot would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 73  delivering a surprise of  8 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cabot doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cabot-oil-cog-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200441945,200441945

    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement Which Way are Top and Bottom Line Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings per share has been downwardly revised by 2 cents in the past seven days to 33 cents  Nonetheless  it indicates an increase from the year ago reported earnings of 13 cents per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  497 million  suggesting an improvement from  453 million reported in the prior year quarter Factors at PlayCabot s acreage in the Marcellus shale play positions it for significant output growth in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equivalent production for second quarter 2019 is pegged at 213 billion cubic feet  Bcf  of natural gas  higher than 172 4 Bcf in the year ago period Natural gas realizations  including the impact of its hedging program  are also expected to increase y y  which may buoy the company s upcoming results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average natural gas price realization for second quarter 2019 is  2 23 per thousand cubic feet  up from  2 15 reported a year earlier  However  natural gas realizations are likely to decline sequentially  as the commodity remains in the bearish territory amid growing fears that soaring production is outpacing demand growth  which may lead to weaker results on a sequential basis What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict that Cabot will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter to be reported  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  2 11  Zacks Rank  Cabot currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of a positive surprise Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Cabot  here are some companies from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarterly reports TransCanada Corporation   TSX TRP   has an Earnings ESP of  0 34  and a Zacks Rank  3  The firm is expected to release second quarter earnings on Aug 1  You can see Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  has an Earnings ESP of  0 55  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is anticipated to release second quarter earnings on Aug 1 Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   has an Earnings ESP of  8 88  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is anticipated to release quarterly earnings on Aug 2 Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-output-growth-propel-cabots-cog-earnings-in-q2-200442977,200442977

prices have fallen to levels not seen in more than three years  reflecting a steady  albeit slow  descent  Market participants are worried that even a spike in heating demand might not be enough to stop the commodity s collapse below the psychologically important  2 per MMBtu level shortly Here are at least three reasons why they think so Narrowing Deficit to the 5 Year Average While inventories are still under the five year average  rapidly replenishing stocks mean that supplies have climbed swiftly over the past few months  The latest EIA report puts total natural gas stocks at 2 689 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    343 Bcf  14 6   above 2018 levels at this time and just 111 Bcf  4   under the five year average  Assuming the current pace of storage build  supply deficit to the five

for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand  However   high production in the United States and expectations for healthy  through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand Significant Flaring While oil production in shale basins like the Permian  Eagle Ford and North Dakota have seen a rapid rise since 2016  it is accompanied by structural challenges like natural gas flaring  Operators are experiencing some growing pains as natural gas output   a largely unwanted derivative that emerges alongside oil production in the region   outpaces gathering and processing capacity  leading to increased flaring  The flaring  leads to greenhouse gas emissions like methane  Therefore  the operators can either  self restrict  oil production until more natural gas infrastructure is built or pay others with space on existing pipelines to transport the unwanted gas  As companies are reluctant to stop drilling for oil  they continue to  flare  natural gas unabated  Some estimates indicate that operators burn off around 1 billion cubic feet of the commodity each day in the Permian  The huge amount of

200828,422344,COG,Is Cabot  COG  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Cabot Oil  COG  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this independent oil and gas company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Cabot is 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 68  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of  5 8  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Cabot has an S TA ratio of 0 55  which means that the company gets  0 55 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 31  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Cabot looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 8  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Cabot have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Cabot has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Cabot is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-cabot-cog-a-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-to-think--yes--200415435,200415435

Prior to today s trading  shares of the independent oil and gas company had gained 5 66  over the past month  This has outpaced the Oils Energy sector s gain of 0 23  and the S P 500 s gain of 3 16  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from COG as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be April 26  2019  On that day  COG is projected to report earnings of  0 63 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 125   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  654 15 million  up 38 23  from the year ago period 
COG s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  1 97 per share and revenue of  2 38 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  65 55  and  8 97   respectively 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for COG  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 5 99  higher within the past month  COG currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Investors should also note COG s current valuation metrics  including its Forward P E ratio of 13 96  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 15 72  which means COG is trading at a discount to the group 
Meanwhile  COG s PEG ratio is currently 0 39  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  The Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 as of yesterday s close

200870,422386,COG,Cabot Oil  COG  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cabot Oil  COG  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  135 7  
Revenues are expected to be  666 58 million  up 40 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12 09  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cabot 
For Cabot  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 43  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Cabot will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cabot would post earnings of  0 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 55  delivering a surprise of  5 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cabot appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cabot-oil-cog-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200408795,200408795

200894,422410,COG,Cabot  COG  Upgraded To Strong Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Cabot Oil  COG   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cabot is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Cabot imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

200895,422411,COG,Here s Why W T Offshore  WTI  Stock Is A Must Buy Right Now,opinion,"W T Offshore  Inc    NYSE WTI   holds tremendous upside potential due to its growing presence in the deep water and shelf of Gulf of Mexico  GoM   wherein production grew more than 500  and proved reserves surged nearly 900  over the past eight years  The company s increasing reserve base in the GoM  the second largest basin in the United States in terms of production  will boost output in the coming quarters 
Let s delve deeper to analyse the factors that make W T Offshore an attractive investment option at the moment 
Offshore Resurgence  We would like to remind investors that the steadiness in oil prices at the current levels of above  60 per barrel is driving operators to make longer term plans  as deepwater projects become cost effective  Producers like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   which holds huge potential in the U S  GoM  recently put up an interesting picture for investors at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans  These companies expect offshore production to come out of the shadows of shale drilling  reflecting a resurgence 
GoM Strength  The company s extensive presence in the GoM is commendable  Its operations are spread across roughly 48 oil and gas offshore fields  covering around 650 000 gross acres  It covers roughly 440 000 gross acres in the GoM shelf  while the company operates across 210 000 gross acres in the deepwater  Notably  W T Offshore created a joint venture with a group of investors to drill 14 pre defined projects in the GoM over more than three years 
The GoM provides unique advantages  including low decline rates  world class permeability and significant potential reserves that are untapped  The company recorded 60 4 million barrels of oil equivalent  MMBoe  of proven or 1P reserves in the GoM shelf  In the deepwater GoM  it has 21 7 MMBoe of 1P reserves  Significant proved reserve bases in both the shelf and deepwater resources will contribute to the upstream energy player s cash flows 
Surging Cashflow  Through 2018  the company generated  321 8 million of operating cash flows  which more than doubled from the 2017 level of  159 4 million  We expect this momentum to continue in the coming quarters as well  backed by higher realized crude and natural gas liquids prices  and lower expenditure on plugging and abandonment activities 
Liquidity  By the end of 2018  W T Offshore reduced its long term debt by 34 6  from the year ago level to  634 million  This visible downward trend can be noticed in the company s balance sheet for the last few years  as shown in the figure below  Moreover  total liquidity of  252 7 million  as of Dec 31  2018  for this small cap company is remarkable  Overall  the financial flexibility enables the company to support its growth projects 

 
Upbeat Production Guidance  For full year 2019  W T Offshore expects production in the band of 12 9 14 3 MMBoe  The upper limit of the band is much higher than the 2018 level of 13 3 MMBoe 
As you can see  the company s strong fundamentals and strategic positioning makes it well poised to outperform the market in the coming days  The analysts also believe so and consequently hiked its guidance in the last few weeks  Over the past month  earnings estimates for the current year have risen from 43 cents per share to 73 cents 
Price Movement  The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company s upside potential has also been reflected in the stock movement  Its shares significantly outperformed the in the past year  During the said period  the upstream company gained 58 7  against the 18 9  decline of its industry 

 
Moreover  on the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 5 3X  significantly lower than one year high mark of 7 2X  This also confirms the stock s strong upside potential  Since oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt

Monetized Hedge Position
Antero Resources received  357 million for the monetization of its hedge position  Net proceeds from the move were  235 million  which includes 68  of the company s April December 2019 swaps  The company has replaced its monetized part of 1 575 million cubic feet per day  MMcf d  with collars 
For the April December period of 2019  the monetized volume is expected to have a floor price of  2 50 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  and a ceiling in the range of  3 31  3 54 per MMBtu 
While the floor price enables the company to keep a low risk profile  the price ceiling can help it take advantage of a price rise  Notably  the company s total production through third quarter 2018 was recorded at 250 billion cubic feet equivalent  comprising 71 6  natural gas  Also  per Energy Information Administration  Henry Hub natural gas spot price in 2019 is expected to average  2 98 per MMBtu  lower than the expected average of  3 01 for the current year

Additionally  the company plans to keep its 2019 capital spending for drilling and completion within its operating cash flows  Antero Resources expects the restructuring and monetizing of a portion of its hedge portfolio to strengthen the balance sheet  While the company started 2017 with a stand alone leverage ratio of 3 2  it targets to reduce the same to 2 2 by the end of 2018

Fourth Quarter Update

200939,422455,COG,5 Beaten Down Oil   Gas Stocks Set To Bounce Back In 2019,opinion,As the year 2018 comes to an end  the S P 500 Index looks set to close on a negative note  The benchmark has logged nearly 10  losses since the beginning of this year  While the sell off has been blamed on myriad woes  including weaker earnings growth  U S  China trade war  Fed rate hike  government shutdown worries  slowing global economy  among others  oil prices  perhaps  remains the biggest worry Energy  The Worst Performing S P SectorEnergy investors have taken it on the chin this year  as the Zacks  sector has now fallen almost 20   With WTI crude   the American benchmark   plunging to a 17 month low of  45 59 a barrel on Friday  it comes as no surprise that the sector dominates the S P s laggards list this year While crude has been a major drag on stocks  natural gas has fared much better  The heating fuel has seen big gains this year even with the commodity s recent pullback   Let s discuss the 2018 performance of oil and gas in more depth  plus what to expect in 2019 Supply Side Woes Plague Oil MarketA steady increase in the price of U S  oil over the last two years culminated in the benchmark popping above  76 per barrel in early October  the highest level in nearly four years  Supply side shocks out of Iran  Venezuela and Libya in the face of growing global consumption levels   especially in emerging markets such as China and India   put the oil market in a fundamentally tight spot Now  in a stunning reversal  oil is facing a two pronged attack  rising supply from major producers and fear that an economic slowdown will dampen the outlook for demand  Oil s troubles helped send the index into a tailspin  leading to a 40  drop from recent highs  Even the OPEC led supply cuts look unlikely to end the market surplus Global oil supplies are looking plentiful and are expected to outstrip demand at the beginning of 2019  Predictions of more crude coming to the supply side through record production in the United States have added to the bearish sentiment on the market  Even the demand side looks jittery with OPEC forecasting weaker consumption Natural Gas Supported by Robust Growth NarrativeNatural gas futures  which last month crossed the  4 per MMBtu mark for the first time in four years  returned attractive gains this year  and are trading significantly up in the year to date Prices are up around 30  since the start of the year as despite skyrocketing production  the current storage remains 20  below benchmarks Importantly  the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand Look for Bargain Buys with Strong FundamentalsUnder the circumstances  oil and gas prices might continue to move in opposite directions through early 2019  If investors are eager to lap up opportunities in this volatile and speculative sector  a prudent move would be to buy the beaten down stocks with encouraging fundamentals  Stressed valuations do not always indicate that the stock has lost all potential  In fact  some could actually make a great buy  But prospective investors need to do adequate research before betting one s hard earned money on such stocks To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see  Finally  the

200941,422457,COG,Marathon Oil  MRO  Down 44  In 3 Months  Can It Rebound ,opinion,The oil and gas sector is walking a tight rope  thanks to persistent turbulence in 2018  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  initiated the year at just above  60 per barrel of oil and touched multi year highs of more than  76 in early October  However  the rally was short lived as commodity plunged more than 40  since then due to apprehensions of oversupply and economic headwinds  The downside in oil prices and other headwinds have weighed on the shares of Marathon Oil   NYSE MRO   that plunged more than 44  in the past three months  wider than the industry s fall of 33 6    What s Affecting Marathon Oil  As mentioned above  declining crude prices in the past few months have weighed on the stock  Crude is reeling under the effects of supply glut along with fears of economic slowdown  which has been weakening commodity demand  However  crude woes are not the only concerns  it just adds to the list of problems in Marathon Oil s story   The company s third quarter earnings beat and raised 2018 guidance have not been able to raise investors  optimism  Notably  Marathon Oil s reluctance toward returning value to shareholders is a major dampener  The firm s high emphasis on strategic acquisitions and balance sheet strengthening at the cost of dividend growth and share buyback programs do not bode well   Further  one also needs to consider Marathon Oil s struggling international operations  with production declining 23  in the quarter ended on September  The company s divestment strategies that have enhanced cash flows are likely to affect volume growth  Notably  Marathon Oil s ROE of 4 4  compares unfavorably with the industry s 12 4   This reflects on the company s inefficiency to use shareholders  funds  Nonetheless  we believe that Marathon Oil  which carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  enjoys multiple tailwinds  Hence  investors should consider retaining this stock for long term prospects   Factors to Buoy Marathon Oil in 2019 In the past two years  the Texas based energy explorer inked several deals to divest non core assets that are not in sync with its long term growth plan  Marathon Oil s strong inventory of development projects  in liquid rich resource plays and other focus areas such as Equatorial Guinea  depicts visible production growth in the upcoming years  The company has boosted growth momentum in the key low cost high margin resource plays that include Oklahoma  Eagle Ford  Bakken and Northern Delaware  With exposure in other shale plays apart from Permian  the company does not face geographical concentration risk  Further  it is less exposed to the pipeline pinch and cost inflation woes in Permian region when compared with the Permian pure plays   Marathon Oil is improving the quality of assets and is well positioned to enhance production and revenues  In the last quarter  the company posted production available for sale of 304 000 oil equivalent barrels per day  BOE d   up from 245 000 BOE d in the third quarter of 2017  Marathon Oil expects 2018 production growth for these shale plays in the range of 30 34   The company s diverse operation is likely to boost revenues and profits in the upcoming years  Marathon Oil s strong financials bode well  The company lowered total debt by  1 75 billion in 2017  It carries a manageable debt to capital ratio of 31 3  that provides financial flexibility and enables it to tap on growth opportunities  Importantly  the company generated organic free cash flow of  320 million during the September quarter with year to free cash flow amounting to  632 million  Bottom Line Volatility in the oil and gas environment is likely to persist in the near term and raises concern about the stock  Nevertheless  Marathon Oil s impressive portfolio of diverse operations and balance sheet strength provide some ray of hope  Notably  long term earnings per share growth rate is projected at 9    Meanwhile  investors interested in the energy space can consider better ranked players like Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG    SilverBow Resources  Inc    NYSE SBOW   and Archrock  Inc    NYSE AROC    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    You can see  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies  It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6  and  67 1    And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marathon-oil-mro-down-44-in-3-months-can-it-rebound-200371083,200371083

200966,422482,COG,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Cabot  SilverBow  Archrock And TransCanada,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  December 18  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG    SilverBow Resources  Inc    NYSE SBOW    Archrock  Inc    NYSE AROC   and TransCanada Corp    TO TRP   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  These 4 Natural Gas Stocks Could Be Big Winners in 2019Natural gas futures took a tumble last week  declining around 15   after forecasts of bearish weather outlook raised some red flags regarding heating demand  On Friday  natural gas for January delivery fell 7 2   to settle at  3 827 per MMBtu  The contract was down 14 7  for the week   the biggest in almost three years Although expectations of milder than expected December temperatures hinted at softening consumption  we believe the commodity is still supported by a robust long term growth narrative  As such  we feel recent weakness is an opportunity to buy energy companies with a lot of exposure to natural gas Natural Gas Rockets Higher in 2018Natural gas futures  which last month rose to its highest in four years  returned attractive gains in 2018  and are still trading significantly up in the year to date  despite the recent plunge In fact  natural gas prices are on a tear  Prices are up around 30  since the start of the year and soared 41  last month  making it the market s best performing commodity of November  Natural gas recently broke the  4 per MMBtu mark for the first time in four years with cooler weather conditions resulting in strong demand for the heating fuel  Despite skyrocketing production  natural gas entered the winter season with stockpiles at their lowest in 15 years Even now  the current storage remains well below benchmarks  At 2 914 trillion cubic feet  Tcf   natural gas inventories are nearly 20  under the five year average and the year ago figure Positive Long Term Thesis  U S    AbroadThe fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia Pacific region in particular The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow 43  from 2015 to 2040  Countries in Asia and in the Middle East   led by China s transition away from coal   will account for most of this increase  The replacement of coal fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects have also contributed to the strength in natural gas demand At the same time  natural gas has now replaced coal as the top choice for electricity generation in the United States  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to   from 25  in 2011 New pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities like Cheniere Energy s Sabine Pass terminal and Dominion Energy s Cove Point export plant  have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  As per the Energy Department  gross liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 5 25 Bcf per day in 2019  increasing nearly 80  from this year  Apart from surging exports  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand Natural Gas Roadmap for 2019Yes  natural gas had a great 2018  till now that is  but what about 2019  Will history repeat itself While it s hard to predict whether natural gas will soar again next year  there s reason to believe that 2019 could be an excellent one for natural gas stocks  In particular  if the current  2018 2019  winter turns out to be colder than normal  the surge in expected demand   in the face of relative deficit of natural gas inventory   could trigger a large rally in the commodity s price The strong year to date rally and the possibility of further price gains does not necessarily indicate that every natural gas scrip would be a wise pick  To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight four stocks that carry a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see  Our ChoicesCabot Oil   Gas Corp   It is engaged in high impact natural gas focused drilling in the Marcellus Shale  The Houston  TX based stock  which currently has a Zacks Rank  1  is a natural gas pure play  The company

About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  A Smaller than Expected Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 89 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 4  below the guidance  of 92 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 
While the second injection of the 2018 refill season was higher than both last year s build of 49 Bcf and the 5 year  2013 2017  average addition of 75 Bcf for the reported week  the current storage remains well below benchmarks  At 1 432 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    natural gas inventories are 520 Bcf  26 6   under the five year average and 863 Bcf  37 6   below the year ago figure 
Following EIA s latest commentary  natural gas prices gained around 3 5  last week to settle at  2 806 per MMBtu on Friday 
Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 85 9 Bcf per day  essentially flat on a weekly basis due to steady production 
Meanwhile  daily natural gas consumption fell 4 3  to 55 3 Bcf  The decrease in demand was triggered by a 36 9  plunge in residential commercial consumption due to warmer weather  partly offset by higher natural gas usage for power generation 
Positive Long Term Thesis
The fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia Pacific region in particular 
The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040  Countries in Asia and in the Middle East   led by China s transition away from coal   will account for most of this increase 
And it will be the world s largest gas producer U S   which will step up to meet this soaring demand  With domestic prices struggling to break the  3 per million Btu threshold  U S  natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U S  production at higher prices to rest of the world  In fact  more than 50  of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas  LNG   As per Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA   the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022 
Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports  the replacement of coal fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above  3 
The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG    Chesapeake Energy Cor    NYSE CHK    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    WPX Energy  Inc    NYSE WPX    Antero Resources Corp    NYSE AR   and EQT Corp    NYSE EQT

Moreover  the third injection of the 2018 refill season was higher than both last year s build of 64 Bcf and the 5 year  2013 2017  average addition of 87 Bcf for the reported week

In other words  EIA s latest commentary points to a tightening supply demand balance with growing natural gas use for air conditioning amid flat production  As a result  natural gas prices gained around 1 5  last week to settle at  2 847 per MMBtu on Friday

201129,422645,COG,3 Natural Gas Stocks To Buy As Heating Bills Rise ,opinion,"Extreme cold hit much of the U S  in recent weeks  causing heating bills to skyrocket  When this happens  companies in the natural gas business often benefit  as natural gas accounts for the highest percentage of electricity generation in the U S 
According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  natural gas accounted for 34  of U S  electricity generation in 2016  ahead of coal  nuclear  and renewables  Therefore  as many Americans crank up their heat to combat the bitter temperatures  companies in the natural gas industry stand to make more money 
For investors that think natural gas is simply a seasonal investment  that is not necessarily the case  The EIA expects natural gas consumption to climb in 2018 and 2019  On top of that  as coal plants slowly fade away  our reliance on natural gas is likely to increase 
With that said  let s take a look at three companies that run U S  natural gas businesses that stand to benefit  not only from the cold  but also from the continued importance of natural gas 
1       Marathon   NYSE MPC  
The second largest U S  refiner based on crude oil refining capacity is also heavily invested in natural gas after its  15 6 billion acquisition of MarkWest in 2015  and now operates natural gas gathering systems in six states  Marathon is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and rocks an  A  VGM grade  supported by  A  grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system 
Most of the harsh winter won t be reflected in the company s upcoming Q4 results  However  looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018  Marathon is projected to see its earnings climb by 983  to hit  0 65 per share  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  On top of that  the company s sales are expected to surge from  16 39 billion in the year ago period to  21 23 billion 
Looking even further down the road  Marathon is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 14 24  over the next three to five years  driven in part by the continued growth of natural gas 
2        Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   
This Houston based company is engaged in the development  exploitation  and exploration of oil and gas exclusively in the continental U S  Cabot produces and also  for resale throughout the U S  Therefore  Cabot stands to benefit greatly from increased natural gas consumption in the U S  The stock is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   boasting  A  grades for both Growth and Momentum 
Cabot is projected to see its sales jump by over 37  in Q4  while its bottom line is projected to expand by 1 200   The brutal weather is somewhat reflected in these growth projections  But investors should also be very happy to note that Cabot is expected to expand its EPS figures at a annualized rate of 30  over the next three to five years  as the use of natural gas goes up in the U S 
3        BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited   NYSE BHP  
BHP  which operates throughout the world  is diversified across an array of minerals  as well as conventional and unconventional oil and gas operations  The firm s U S  operations include major natural gas production 
BHP is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports  B  grades for both Value and Momentum  Looking ahead to its current full year  which BHP is slated to report in late June  the company is projected to see its sales soar 43  year over year to hit  44 23 billion  As far as bottom line expansion goes  BHP is expected to see its EPS figures pop by nearly 21  
What s more  the company s current cash flow growth rate of 46  crushes its industry s average and should theoretically help the firm invest in new operations in order to follow the money and production demand which in the U S   at least  points to natural gas

201203,422719,COG,Natural Gas Futures Rally Despite Bearish Inventory Data,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a smaller than expected decrease in natural gas supplies  Nevertheless  prices rose for the week on expectations of colder weather and the resultant strength in the commodity s demand 
About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  Smaller than Expected Draw
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 33 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Nov 24  below the guidance  of 38 Bcf decline  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 
Worse  the decrease was lower than both last year s drop of 43 Bcf and the five year  2012 2016  average net shrinkage of 47 Bcf for the reported week  Following past week s decline   third withdrawal of the 2017 2018 winter heating season   the current storage level now stands at 3 693 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    107 Bcf  2 8   under the five year average and 309 Bcf  7 7   below the year ago figure 
Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 81 9 Bcf per day  up marginally  less than 1   on a weekly basis due to higher production  Meanwhile  daily natural gas consumption decreased 5 4  to 80 8 Bcf  The sharp pullback in demand was triggered by a 10 1  fall in residential commercial consumption on the back of warmer temperatures  Moreover  natural gas consumption for power generation was down by 5  from the previous week 
Futures Jump Despite Bearish EIA Data
Shrugging off EIA s latest commentary  natural gas prices soared around 5  last week to settle at  3 061 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to bet on the return of colder weather  translating into strong heating gas demand  over the next few weeks 
Positive Long Term Thesis
Despite occasional hiccups  the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia Pacific region in particular 
The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040  Countries in Asia and in the Middle East   led by China s transition away from coal   will account for most of this increase 
And it will be the world s largest gas producer U S   which will step up to meet this soaring demand  With domestic prices struggling to break the  3 per million Btu threshold  U S  natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U S  production at higher prices to rest of the world  In fact  more than 50  of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas  LNG   As per Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA   the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022 
Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports  the replacement of coal fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above  3 
The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corp    NASDAQ REXX    Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    WPX Energy Inc    NYSE WPX    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG   and EQT Corp    NYSE EQT

About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  Smaller than Expected Draw
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 206 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Dec  29  below the guidance  of 219 Bcf decline  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 
However  the decrease was significantly higher than both last year s drop of 76 Bcf and the five year  2012 2016  average net shrinkage of 99 Bcf for the reported week  Following past week s decline   seventh withdrawal of the 2017 2018 winter heating season   the current storage level now stands at 3 126 trillion cubic feet  Tcf   192 Bcf  5 8   under the five year average and the year ago figure 
Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 82 4 Bcf per day  down slightly  around 1   on a weekly basis due to lower production  Meanwhile  daily natural gas consumption jumped 23 6  to 137 Bcf 
The sharp increase in demand was triggered by a 39 1  surge in residential commercial consumption on the back of cold temperatures engulfing much of the U S  Moreover  natural gas consumption for power generation was up by 18 9  from the previous week 
Futures Slump Following EIA Data
Following EIA s latest commentary  natural gas prices slumped around 5 4  last week to settle at  2 795 per MMBtu on Friday  Apart from the lower than anticipated draw  investors were spooked by forecasts for an end to the frigid cold snap going into the middle of January leading to decrease in the heating fuel s demand 
Positive Long Term Thesis
Despite occasional hiccups  the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia Pacific region in particular 
The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040  Countries in Asia and in the Middle East   led by China s transition away from coal   will account for most of this increase 
And it will be the world s largest gas producer U S   which will step up to meet this soaring demand  With domestic prices struggling to break the  3 per million Btu threshold  U S  natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U S  production at higher prices to rest of the world  In fact  more than 50  of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas  LNG   As per Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA   the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022 
Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports  the replacement of coal fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above  3 
The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corp    NASDAQ REXX    Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK    Southwestern Energy Company   NYSE SWN    WPX Energy   NYSE WPX    Antero Resources Corp    NYSE AR   and EQT Corp    NYSE EQT

The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  A Smaller than Expected Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 42 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Sep 29  2017  below the guidance  of 47 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 
Moreover  the increase was lower than both last year s addition of 76 Bcf and the 5 year  2012 2016  average net injection of 91 Bcf for the reported week  This caused the current storage level   at 3 508 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    fall below the five year average for the first time since January  Stocks are now 8 Bcf  0 2   under the five year average  while dropping 161 Bcf  4 4   below the year ago figure 
Fundamentally speaking  supply remained essentially unchanged on a weekly basis at 79 7 Bcf per day  while daily natural gas consumption decreased 13 3  to 64 7 Bcf  The flattish supply could be attributed to stagnant dry natural gas production 
On the demand side  the fall was triggered by sharply lower power consumption that tumbled 24 2  week over week on the back of cooler temperatures  A more than 12  dip in residential commercial consumption further dented demand 
Futures End Down Despite Bullish EIA Data
Shrugging off EIA s latest commentary  natural gas prices went down 4 8  last week to settle at  2 863 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to concentrate on mild temperature predictions  translating into easing cooling gas demand  over the next few days  Prices were further dented by the continued strength in dry gas production  which are hovering near record levels 
Positive Long Term Thesis
Despite occasional hiccups  long term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances  While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year  the growing use of liquefied natural gas  or LNG   booming LNG and Mexican exports  replacing coal fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output 
The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five year average in the near future  with deficits piling up later on  Over time  these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price 
The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc    NYSE RICE    Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    WPX Energy Inc    NYSE WPX    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG   and EQT Corp    NYSE EQT   
As of now  we expect the fuel to continue to be range bound around  3 with little chance of any drastic increase

201220,422736,COG,Is A Disappointment In Store For Cabot  COG  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Upstream Energy firm Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   is set to report third quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 27 
Headquartered in Texas  Cabot is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental United States  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings for the current quarter has been revised downward by 16 7  over the last 30 days  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has also moved south by 3 2  over the last 30 days 
Last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6 67  owing to increased costs  However  Cabot delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3 02  in the last four quarters Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Being an upstream firm  weakness in the commodity prices might lower the company s exploration and production activities  Natural gas prices dropped about 3 5  in the July September period  owing to the fuel s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane related power outages 
With natural gas prices trading just around  3 per MMBtu during most part of the third quarter and Cabot being one of the most gas weighted E Ps  the company s earnings and revenues are under pressure  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized gas price is pegged at  2 32 per thousand cubic feet  lower than the prior quarter figure of  2 38  Even the crude price realization is estimated at  43 81 per barrel  lower than the  44 03 per barrel recorded in second quarter 2017 
We also note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output stands at 164 billion cubic feet  Bcf  compared with  166 Bcf in second quarter 2017  This might negatively affect the company s revenues  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  410 million for the third quarter  down 10 9  from the prior quarter 
Further  during 2017  Cabot is likely to spend  845 million which is more than twice of the 2016 spending level of around  375 million  This might lower the company s cash flows  Last quarter  Cabot s operating expenses were higher by around 27  on increased administrative  general and other costs  If the trend continues  the company s earnings are expected to get hurt 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  18 81   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 8 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 10 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
Zacks Rank  Cabot presently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks with Favorable Combination
Though an earnings beat looks uncertain for Cabot  here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat 
Unit Corporation   NYSE UNT   has an Earnings ESP of  29 17  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release third quarter earnings report on Nov 3  You can see 
Newpark Resources  Inc    NYSE NR   has an Earnings ESP of  33 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is likely to release third quarter earnings result on Oct 30 
Suncor Energy Inc    NYSE SU   has an Earnings ESP of  8 07  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is anticipated to report third quarter earnings numbers on Oct 25

About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  A Larger than Expected Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 97 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Sep 15  2017  above the guidance  of 89 Bcf gain  as per the expectations from analysts and traders 
Worse  the increase was higher than both last year s addition of 54 Bcf and the 5 year  2012 2016  average net injection of 73 Bcf for the reported week  This caused the current storage level   at 3 408 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    to widen its surplus to the five year average to 67 Bcf  2    while stocks are still 136 Bcf  3 8   below the year ago figure 
Fundamentally speaking  supply edged up 1 4  to 80 2 Bcf per day  while daily natural gas consumption jumped 11 3  to 71 1 Bcf  The slight increase in supply could be attributed to growth in dry natural gas production and Canadian imports  On the demand side  the healthy improvement was triggered by hot weather in the East and sharply higher power consumption in Florida as demand returned to pre Irma levels 
Futures End Down After Bearish EIA Data
Following EIA s latest commentary  natural gas prices fell 2 2  last week to settle at  2 959 per MMBtu on Friday  Investors also chose to concentrate on cooler than normal weather predictions  translating into lower cooling gas demand  over the next few days  Prices were further dented by expanding dry gas production 
Positive Long Term Thesis
Despite occasional hiccups  long term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances  While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year  the growing use of liquefied natural gas  or LNG   booming LNG and Mexican exports  replacing coal fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output 
The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five year average in the near future  with deficits piling up later on  Over time  these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price 
The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc    NYSE RICE    Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    WPX Energy Inc    NYSE WPX    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG   and EQT Corp    NYSE EQT   
As of now  we expect the fuel to continue to be range bound around  3 with little chance of any drastic increase

Analysis of the Data  A Smaller than Expected Rise in Storage

While the increase was higher than last year s addition of 49 Bcf  it was well under the five year  2012 2016  average injection of 84 Bcf for the reported week  This caused the current storage level   at 3 466 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    narrow its surplus to the five year average to 41 Bcf  1 2    while stocks are still 127 Bcf  3 5   below the year ago figure 
Fundamentally speaking  supply remained essentially unchanged on a weekly basis at 80 1 Bcf per day  while daily natural gas consumption increased 4 8  to 74 6 Bcf  The flattish supply could be attributed to stagnant dry natural gas production 
On the demand side  the improvement was triggered by sharply higher power consumption  Interestingly  it was mix of elevated heating and cooling demand that led to a 9  week over week gain in power consumption  The eastern half of the country experienced hotter weather but the western part of U S  saw lower then normal temperatures 
Futures End Down Despite Bullish EIA Data
Shrugging off EIA s latest commentary  natural gas prices edged down 0 5  last week to settle at  3 007 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to concentrate on below normal temperature predictions  translating into easing cooling gas demand  over the first few days of October  Prices were further dented by the continued strength in dry gas production

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Natural Gas Supply Glut Narrows on Below Average Build

	The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a larger than expected increase in natural gas supplies  However  the build was well below historical averages that helped the commodity shave off its surplus to the 5 year average 

About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report

	The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 

	The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 

Analysis of the Data  A Larger than Expected Rise in Storage 

	Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 61 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended June 16  2017  above the guidance  of 58 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 

	However  the increase was lower than both last year s addition of 63 Bcf and the 5 year  2012 2016  average net injection of 82 Bcf for the reported week  This helped the current storage level   at 2 770 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    narrow its surplus to the five year average to 207 Bcf  8 1    while stocks are 324 Bcf  10 5   lower than the year ago figure 

Positive Long Term Thesis

	As of now  the demand situation looks promising with hot conditions prevailing in certain U S  pockets and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand 

	In any case  long term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances  While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year  the growing use of liquefied natural gas  or LNG   booming exports to Mexico  replacing coal fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output  The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the 5 year average in the near future  with deficits piling up later on 

	Over the summer  these secular tailwinds are likely to have a positive impact on natural gas sentiment and price 

	The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Range Resources Corp   NYSE           Rice Energy Inc   NYSE           Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE           Southwestern Energy Co   NYSE           WPX Energy Inc   NYSE           Cabot Oil   Gas Corp  NYSE COG   and EQT Corp  NYSE EQT

supplies following which the commodity traded up  However  worries over the fuel s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions more than offset the gains and pushed down natural gas prices

trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is now 319 Bcf  10 2   lower than the year ago figure  although stocks are still 181 Bcf  6 9   above the five year average The bullish inventory numbers spurred a short lived natural gas rally on Thursday with the commodity rising to  3 11 shortly after the report s release  However  the electricity generation fuel gave up all its gains later in the day and sold off as investors took note of cooler than normal weather predictions  translating into lower heating gas demand  for the week ahead  As a result  natural gas ended Thursday at  3 042 per MMBtu   down 1 7

About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  A Larger than Expected Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 72 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended June 30  2017  above the guidance  of 63 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider  Worse  the increase was higher than both last year s addition of 38 Bcf and the 5 year  2012 2016  average net injection of 66 Bcf for the reported week 
This caused the current storage level   at 2 888 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    widen its surplus to the five year average to 187 Bcf  6 9    while stocks are 285 Bcf  9 0   lower than the year ago figure 
The bearish build in natural gas inventories created immediate selling pressure on the commodity  which tumbled 5 6  for the week to end Friday at  2 864 per MMBtu  Apart from the EIA data  the electricity generation fuel also sold off as investors took note of cooler than normal weather predictions  translating into lower heating gas demand  for the week ahead 
Positive Long Term Thesis
Despite occasional hiccups  the natural gas demand situation looks promising with hot conditions set to prevail in most U S  pockets in the later part of July and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand 
In any case  long term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances  While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year  the growing use of liquefied natural gas  or LNG   booming exports to Mexico  replacing coal fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output  The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the 5 year average in the near future  with deficits piling up later on 
Over the summer  these secular tailwinds are likely to have a positive impact on natural gas sentiment and price 
Which Stocks to Bet On
The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc    NYSE RICE    Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    WPX Energy Inc    NYSE WPX    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG   and EQT Corp    NYSE EQT   
However  each of these firms has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which means that investors should preferably wait for a better entry point before buying shares in them 
In case you are looking for natural gas names for your portfolio  one could opt for Cheniere Energy Inc    NYSE LNG    It has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this company is for a loss of 13 cents  representing some 93 1  earnings per share growth over 2016  Next year s average forecast is 56 cents  pointing to another 514 8  growth

Analysis  Less than Expected Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 2 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Mar 31  2017  below the guidance  of 10 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider  The miniscule build in natural gas inventories helped the commodity to end Friday at  3 331 per MMBtu   the highest close since Jan 27 
However  a bout of warmer temperatures in major heating demand regions meant that the increase compared unfavorably with the 5 year  2012 2016  average shrinkage of 13 Bcf for the reported week though it was below last year s addition of 6 Bcf 
Following the small climb during the final storage week of the 2016 2017 winter heating season  the current storage level   at 2 051 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is down 427 Bcf  17 2   from last year but is 265 Bcf  14 8   above the five year average 
Positive Long Term Thesis
With the winter heating period   which runs from Nov 1 to Mar 31   coming to an end and the injection season taking off  the nation s gas usage is likely to hit a low on the back of mild spring temperatures  The demand situation is expected to improve once warm weather sets in and gas fired electricity generation for air conditioning need picks up 
In any case  long term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be bullish on the back of structural imbalances  While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year  the growing use of liquefied natural gas  or LNG   booming exports to Mexico  replacing coal fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output  The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the 5 year average in the near future  with deficits piling up later on 
By the onset of summer months  these secular headwinds will start to have a positive impact on natural gas sentiment and price

201310,422826,COG,Natural Gas Breaks Through  3 5  Watch These 4 Stocks,opinion,"Market has recently been absorbed with the latest news of OPEC deal to cut oil production  which has helped crude prices rally back over  50 per barrel  While this is definitely good news  let s turn our focus on natural gas that is going through equally exciting times 
The commodity is seeing increased demand with the advent of winter  leading to increase in prices  It goes without saying that it is time for natural gas exploration and production players to celebrate   
Looking Back
Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas    natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations   has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer 
With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance 
Price Weakness in Early 2016
With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge  natural gas prices hit 17 year lows of around  1 6 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in the first quarter  The glut was further exacerbated by lackluster industrial requirement over the past few years 
Strong Recovery 
Since then  successive below average builds on the back of warmer temperature across the country followed by the recent start of the withdrawal season  has been cutting into the year over year storage surplus  Statistically speaking  the current storage level   at around 4 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  is up only slightly from last year and is just 6  above the five year average  As a result  natural gas prices have rebounded strongly and doubled from the extreme lows it hit in March  The dramatic recovery has helped the commodity stay above the key psychological level of  3 per MMBtu
Most importantly  the commodity settled at  3 654 per MMBtu as of Dec 5   the highest level since Dec 2014  Here s why 
Finally  we feel the chills of winter  In fact  as per the new forecast  lower than average temperature is extending rapidly from shore to shore of the U S  This has definite improved the outlook for natural gas prices as we know that with the advent of winter almost half of the homes in the U S  need to burn natural gas for heating purposes 
Natural Gas Stocks on Fire
The increased demand for natural gas is already reflected in the price of the commodity  There is no doubt that companies involved in the exploration and production of natural gas could sell the commodity at higher prices  Here we have employed our proprietary screening model to select prospective stocks that are worth watching

Crude Oil

U S  oil futures have been very volatile in 2016 with prices recovering from a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in February to  50 barrel mark in early June and then slipping again to under  40 

While factors like Canadian wildfires  Nigerian outages disruptions  production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers contributed to jump in prices earlier this year that saw the benchmark recover significantly  these issues have largely vanished from the market  As of now  overproduction of crude and a glut of refined products keep the commodity under pressure 

At over 520 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 15  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year  As it is  improvement in oil fundamentals remain fragile with the existing stocks of refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand  Piling on the misery is the Baker Hughes report revealing a steady rise in the U S  oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities 

A number of major industry players  including Exxon Mobil Corp     and BP plc    have reported sub standard second quarter numbers as lower energy prices take a toll 

Over the past few trading days  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures have surged around 10  to around  45 a barrel on renewed expectations of a production freeze from the 14 member OPEC bloc and Russia  However  several analysts have expressed skepticism over this mini rally  pointing to the last such attempt made in April that failed spectacularly 

Oil is facing the heat on several other fronts as well  Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China s crude demand  In particular  the Asian giant s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world s No  2 energy consumer 

What s more  in the absence of production cuts from OPEC  the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping despite crashing prices  and concerns over the effects of Brexit on crude demand   not much upside is expected in oil prices in the near term  Moreover  a stronger dollar has made the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency 

As it is  with inventories at the highest level during this time of the year  crude is very well stocked  On top of that  the top producers of Middle East   pumping at full throttle   have indicated time and again that they are more intent on preserving market share rather than attempting to arrest the price decline through production cuts  Therefore  the commodity is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout 2016 

In our view  crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways to bearish trend  mostly trading in the  35  45 per barrel range  As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming  we are likely to experience pressure to the price of a barrel of oil 

Natural Gas

 It s cleaner  it s cheaper and it s domestic  

  Legendary energy entrepreneur T  Boone Pickens  in reference to natural gas 

Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas    natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations   has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer 

With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance 

Statistically speaking  the current storage level   at 3 317 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is up 361 Bcf  12   from last year and is 440 Bcf  15   above the five year average  Expectedly  this has taken a toll on prices  Natural gas peaked at about  13 50 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2008 but dropped to its lowest level in almost 17 years   at  1 611 per million Btu  MMBtu    in the first quarter  Apart from plentiful stocks  which hit an all time high in November  the selloff was spurred by tepid demand for the fuel due to mild weather spurred by the El Ni o phenomenon 

In response to continued weak natural gas prices  major U S  producers like Cimarex Energy Co      Cabot Oil   Gas Corp     and Range Resources Corp      have all taken significant cost cutting measures  including a reduction in their capital expenditure budgets 

With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge  natural gas prices have been held back  Industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past few years with demand barely rising  In fact  EIA estimates natural gas inventories will reach 4 042 Tcf by the end of October   a record level for that time of the year 

In the past  winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply  But with no dearth of new supply  even this association is becoming more and more obsolete  Finally  with improved drilling productivity offsetting the historic decline in rig count  we do not expect gas prices to rally anytime soon

201355,422871,COG,Oil   Gas Industry Outlook   Aug  2016,opinion,"Crude Oil
U S  oil futures have been very volatile in 2016 with prices recovering from a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in February to  50 barrel mark in early June and then slipping again to under  40 
While factors like Canadian wildfires  Nigerian outages disruptions  production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers contributed to jump in prices earlier this year that saw the benchmark recover significantly  these issues have largely vanished from the market  As of now  overproduction of crude and a glut of refined products keep the commodity under pressure 
At over 520 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 15  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year  As it is  improvement in oil fundamentals remain fragile with the existing stocks of refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand  Piling on the misery is the Baker Hughes report revealing a steady rise in the U S  oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities 
A number of major industry players  including Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM    XOM   Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  RDS A  and BP plc  LON BP   BP  have reported sub standard second quarter numbers as lower energy prices take a toll 
Over the past few trading days  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures have surged around 10  to around  45 a barrel on renewed expectations of a production freeze from the 14 member OPEC bloc and Russia  However  several analysts have expressed skepticism over this mini rally  pointing to the last such attempt made in April that failed spectacularly  
Oil is facing the heat on several other fronts as well  Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China s crude demand  In particular  the Asian giant s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world s No  2 energy consumer   
What s more  in the absence of production cuts from OPEC  the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping despite crashing prices  and concerns over the effects of Brexit on crude demand   not much upside is expected in oil prices in the near term  Moreover  a stronger dollar has made the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency 
As it is  with inventories at the highest level during this time of the year  crude is very well stocked  On top of that  the top producers of Middle East   pumping at full throttle   have indicated time and again that they are more intent on preserving market share rather than attempting to arrest the price decline through production cuts  Therefore  the commodity is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout 2016 
In our view  crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways to bearish trend  mostly trading in the  35  45 per barrel range  As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming  we are likely to experience pressure to the price of a barrel of oil 
Natural Gas
 It s cleaner  it s cheaper and it s domestic  
  Legendary energy entrepreneur T  Boone Pickens  in reference to natural gas 
Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas    natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations   has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer 
With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance 
Statistically speaking  the current storage level   at 3 317 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is up 361 Bcf  12   from last year and is 440 Bcf  15   above the five year average  Expectedly  this has taken a toll on prices  Natural gas peaked at about  13 50 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2008 but dropped to its lowest level in almost 17 years   at  1 611 per million Btu  MMBtu    in the first quarter  Apart from plentiful stocks  which hit an all time high in November  the selloff was spurred by tepid demand for the fuel due to mild weather spurred by the El Ni o phenomenon 
In response to continued weak natural gas prices  major U S  producers like Cimarex Energy Co  NYSE XEC    XEC   Cabot Oil   Gas Corp  NYSE COG    COG  and Range Resources Corp  NYSE RRC    RRC  have all taken significant cost cutting measures  including a reduction in their capital expenditure budgets 
With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge  natural gas prices have been held back  Industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past few years with demand barely rising  In fact  EIA estimates natural gas inventories will reach 4 042 Tcf by the end of October   a record level for that time of the year 
In the past  winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply  But with no dearth of new supply  even this association is becoming more and more obsolete  Finally  with improved drilling productivity offsetting the historic decline in rig count  we do not expect gas prices to rally anytime soon 
ZACKS INDUSTRY RANK
Oil Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry   To learn more visit

The location of these industries suggests that the general outlook for the oil energy space as a whole is  Neutral to Negative  
EARNINGS TRENDS
As is the trend over the past few quarters  a look back at Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil Energy sector were again very weak  dragging down the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index 
Despite an impressive recovery  crude prices stayed under  50   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  Moreover  most oil producers have been churning out  black gold  at full throttle  thereby letting the commodity slip 
Before discussing Q3 2016 quarter estimates  let s take a look at this year s Q2 earnings season  Earnings fell by a whopping 78 9  year over year  following a 108 6  drop witnessed in the previous quarter  Things have been bad on the revenue front too  which was down 24 4  in the June quarter after declining 29 3  in the previous three month period 
Predictably  the picture is looking bleak  though better than the recent quarters  for the upcoming Q3 earnings season  This is not surprising  considering that oil has plunged considerably from its recent peak of  51 23 in early June  in the process dragging down estimate revisions  The Oil Energy sector s earnings are expected to crash 56 1  from the third quarter 2015 levels  while the top line is likely to show a drop of 5 0  
For the S P 500  earnings are estimated to show year over year fall of just 2 6   while revenues are set to rise 1 9  during the three months ended Sep 30  2016  This puts the Oil Energy sector in a bad light when compared to the broader markets  In fact  taking out Oil Energy from the index  S P earnings would increase by 0 1   while revenue would be 2 6  higher from the year ago period

Massive Inventories Continue to Weigh on Nat Gas Prices

The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed that the increase in natural gas supplies were in line with expectations 

But nearing 2 7 trillion cubic feet  Tcf   it s still 44  above the 5 year average  Also  mild temperatures across most parts of the country have restricted the commodity s requirement for power burn  As a result  despite the in line rise in stocks  natural gas prices stayed flat 

With production remaining plentiful and expected to outpace demand for most of 2016  the commodity is likely to stay depressed for a while
