14114,235629,ORLY,JD com  Inc   JD  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of JD com  JD   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  37 76 in the previous session  JD com has gained 7 1  since the start of the year compared to the 1 6  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 3 2  return for the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 15  2019  JD com  Inc  reported EPS of  0 29 versus consensus estimate of  0 18 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 53  
For the current fiscal year  JD com  Inc  is expected to post earnings of  1 47 per share on  81 17 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 88 per share on  96 94 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 38 68  and 19 44   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
JD com  Inc  may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
JD com  Inc  has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 25 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 58 3X versus its peer group s average of 19 9X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  JD com  Inc  currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if JD com  Inc  fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though JD com  Inc  shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does JD com  Inc  Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of JD com  Inc  have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS  ASOMY   RH  RH   and O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for JD com  Inc  Still  the fundamentals for JD com  Inc  are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2020-01-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jdcom-inc-jd-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200496255,200496255

14117,235632,ORLY,What Makes O Reilly Automotive  ORLY  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  O Reilly Automotive currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ORLY that show why this auto parts retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ORLY  shares are up 0 92  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry is down 0 33  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 1 13  compares favorably with the industry s 0 52  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of O Reilly Automotive have increased 7 59  over the past quarter  and have gained 26 62  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 6 95  and 12 92   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ORLY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ORLY is averaging 375 745 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ORLY

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 13  2019  JD com  Inc  reported EPS of  0 33 versus consensus estimate of  0 09 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 79  
For the current fiscal year  JD com  Inc  is expected to post earnings of  0 94 per share on  80 46 billion in revenues  This represents a 179 41  change in EPS on a 16 09  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 22 per share on  94 51 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 28 42  and 17 47   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
JD com  Inc  may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style

How Does JD com  Inc  Stack Up to the Competition

14227,235742,ORLY,CarMax Q3 Earnings Preview  Will The Report Drive KMX Stock ,opinion,"CarMax   NYSE KMX   will report its third quarter earnings before the market opens on Friday  December 20  The automobile retailer s stock is up over 57  in 2019 to outpace the automobile retail market s 33  run 
The industry s strong year has also been led by AutoZone   NYSE AZO   and O Reilly Auto Parts   NASDAQ ORLY    CarMax has also been able to have a breakout year despite the broader uncertainty in big ticket items like automobiles 
Gaining Steam 
CarMax has been able to pick up steam in a market where the trade war has casted a cloud over the industry  The market also faces the uncertainty about whether younger millennials are willing to take on the commitment of buying an automobile  CarMax has tried to provide an alternative to consumers looking to purchase a car without the traditional hassles 
The used car retailer saw its net revenue grow 9  to  5 2 billion last quarter and bottom line climb about 13  to  1 40 per share  Wholesale vehicle sales climbed 8   with CarMax buying a higher percentage of appraised vehicles even as the volume of appraisals eased lower 
Comparable used car unit sales were up 3 2  from year ago levels  as CarMax sold 6 2  more used cars during the period than it did in the previous year period  Meanwhile  gains in other sales and revenue accelerated 8 5  

Outlook 
CarMax believes it still has room to grow despite being the largest used car retailer in the United States  The company plans to leverage its scale to reach more consumers through its omnichannel strategy  The automobile retailer attempts to service customers who want to shop for a car online  in person  or a mix of both 
Some automobile retailers  like Carvana   NYSE CVNA    do well online but other smaller retailers don t have the capital to afford a large website or the inventory required to bring a website enough reach  CarMax s omnichannel abilities give the used car retailer an advantage over competitors and extends its growth runway   Customers continue to tell us they value an omnichannel experience  empowering them to shop on their terms whenever and wherever is most convenient for them   CEO Bill Nash said on the Q2 earnings call 
In addition  the company spent  128 3 million to buy back 1 5 million shares in Q2  which was a somewhat slower pace than in the first quarter  CarMax still has another  1 78 billion in accumulated cash left to potentially finance future repurchases 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast earnings to climb over 6  to  1 16 per share and for net revenue to climb 9 61  to  4 71 billion  Sales growth would be right on par with Q2 and earnings would be down from Q2 s 13  hike 
Used vehicle sales are projected to grow about 9 2  to  3 9 billion  which would be right on par with the growth rate it saw in the second quarter  Wholesale vehicle sales are estimated to grow 5   which would represent a slight decrease from the 8  growth in Q2  Other sales and revenues are forecasted to rise 6 9  
Bottom Line 
CarMax s omnichannel approach should bode well for the company as it provides a level of convenience to its customers that is difficult to find in the auto retail industry  CarMax has beaten our estimates the last four quarters with an average EPS surprise of 7 14   The stock currently sits around 1 8  its 52 week high  and a strong report could send the stock to a new high 
The company currently trades around 17 5X its forward earnings  which is slightly below the industry average of 19 2X forward earnings  The discounted valuation could provide a solid entry point before a potential breakout

32674,254189,ORLY,Fund managers gird for long trade war after FedEx slide,news,"By David Randall
NEW YORK  Reuters    A profit warning and muted outlook from package delivery company FedEx Corp  N FDX  is prompting some high profile fund managers to prepare for the trade war between the United States and China to last longer than many had originally anticipated 
Shares of the shipping company  whose business is often seen as a proxy for growth in the global economy  tumbled 13  Wednesday  a day after it said it planned to ground some planes and cut costs due to the effects of the trade war between the world s two largest economies 
 We were hopeful of a trade deal and some sort of return to normalcy and that has not taken place   FedEx s chief executive  Frederick Smith  said on its earnings call 
Companies ranging from parts supplier O Reilly Automotive  O ORLY  to network gear maker Juniper Networks  N JNPR  have said the trade war is weighing on their earnings  Yet investors have focused more on FedEx because the nature of its business touches several industries across the globe  including consumer spending 
An extended trade war could take the wind out of the sails of the rally in the S P 500 benchmark index  which has advanced in line with expectations for an imminent breakthrough in the trade war  High level talks between the two countries are expected to resume again in October  The conflict between the two countries could take a decade to resolve  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned on Sept  6 
As a result  fund managers are moving away from U S  industrials and technology companies that may be most affected by higher tariffs and instead are looking to pick up some out of favor companies and assets that offer long term opportunities despite the trade war 
 It s obvious that China will try to drag this out as long as it can and hope it disappears after the  2020 presidential  election   said Brian Yacktman  whose YCG Enhanced Fund is up nearly 31  for the year to date 
Yacktman is moving more into the shares of European luxury goods makers such as  Kering  SA  PA PRTP   whose brands include Gucci and Botegga Veneta  that have pricing power but have fallen on concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy  Shares of Kering are up 12 4  for the year to date  including a 10  drop over the last three months 
 These are companies that can just pass tariffs on because people want to buy the status symbol   he said 
Emily Roland  co chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management  said her firm has been increasing its  measures of protection  against an economic downturn caused in part by an escalating trade war  Despite a 20 1  gain in the sector this year  she said she still sees opportunities in utilities companies due in part to their above average dividend yields and growth potential 
 Rather than reacting and getting whipsawed by the sudden shifts in sentiment  we believe that investors can create diversified portfolios that seek to minimize downside risks from the trade war  however long it may last   she said 
Not all fund managers are convinced the trade war is here to stay   We still think one way or another Trump will end it before the election   said Lamar Villere  a portfolio manager at New Orleans based Villere   Co 
As a result  he has been moving more assets into sectors such as semiconductors  an industry which will be included in  50 billion worth of goods that will be subject to 30  tariffs starting Oct  1 
 The market is giving you opportunities because we think that this is more of a blip than anything else   he said 
Emmanuel Roman  chief executive officer at bond giant Pimco  said Thursday at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference that he is seeing opportunities in emerging market bonds due to the pessimism from the trade war 
 Obviously the big elephant in the room is the trade war with China and how it will resolve itself   he said ",2019-09-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fund-managers-gird-for-long-trade-war-after-fedex-slide-1982531,1982531

32776,254291,ORLY,U S  retailers hit as immigration worries weigh on Hispanic spending,news,"By Richa Naidu CHICAGO  Reuters    Many U S  Hispanics are venturing out only to buy essential goods and are cutting back on discretionary spending  worried about possible harassment by immigration or law enforcement officials since the election of U S  President Donald Trump  according to community groups  research firms and retailers  This change in consumer behavior by the country s second fastest growing ethnic group has recently been cited as a cause for worry by already struggling consumer companies  from big box retailers to auto parts makers  O Reilly Automotive  O ORLY  Chief Executive Gregory Henslee told analysts earlier this month that many of the company s stores with weak second quarter sales were in Hispanic dominant areas of the United States   It s not just something that we ve seen  It s something that most retailers have seen   Henslee said   In late July   Target  Corp  N TGT  Chief Executive Brian Cornell at a conference referenced a report by retail consultants NPD Group that cited a decline in discretionary spending by Hispanics    They are staying home  They are going out less often  particularly around border towns in the United States   Cornell said at a conference in Aspen  Colo   Trump s surprise election win last November came partly on campaign promises to deport undocumented foreigners en masse and build a wall on the U S  Mexico border  These pledges   along with Trump s claim that Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States   sparked outrage within the American Hispanic community   For our own president to call us criminals  thieves and rapists   it s terrible     we live in fear of doing those simple things like going for groceries   said a 19 year old Chicago college student  Juan F   who did not want his full name used out of concern for family members who are undocumented  Juan  a U S  citizen  said he has been shopping for his household since Trump s presidency began because family members are afraid to leave the house   People are squirreling money away and don t want to leave their houses to go to stores   said Eric Rodriguez of Latino advocacy group UnidosUS  which has been critical of Trump s proposals on immigration   They re afraid local law enforcement or immigration officials are going to harass or embarrass them   he said in an interview  Not all consumer categories  however  are experiencing a significant decline in Hispanic spending  The purchase of essentials such as food and basic household goods is still on the rise  but at a much slower rate than in recent years  according to research firm Nielsen  None of the reports specified any changes to first half online spending by Hispanics  which make up about 18 percent of the U S  population  according to research firm Nielsen Holdings Plc  N NLSN   TRUMP EFFECT The lower spending by Hispanics has been hurting certain retailers since the start of the year  according to reports by brokerage firm Jefferies and analytics firm NPD Group   Cornell  citing a more detailed version of the NPD report than one that has been publicly released  said late last month that shopping visits among Latinos were down about 11 percent in November and December  The  concerning  trend had been noticed particularly around U S  border towns  Cornell said   Their buying power is undeniable  as is their influence on everything from fashion and food to music and entertainment   Cornell said  Big box retailers have for years invested heavily in courting the Hispanic community s substantial spending power  which reached  1 4 trillion in 2016  according to data by the University of Georgia s Terry College of Business  Luis Fitch  founder of Minneapolis based Hispanic marketing company UNO Branding  whose clients have included Target and  Best Buy  Co Inc  N BBY   said several small clients across different cities had posted declining sales since Trump took office  and that this had to be affecting big box retailers  too   It s very common to have a Mexican married to an American  but if that Mexican is undocumented  he s really afraid of going out and looking for work   Fitch said   And if only one person is working  obviously their budget is cut in half and that s a problem if they were going to buy a house or car this year   DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS On average  Hispanics are younger than non Hispanics  have more children  and spend more on each child  according to Jeff Humphreys  director of economic forecasting at the Terry College of Business  Humphreys also said Hispanics tend to spend more on apparel  making their buying choices crucial to many retailers  As the slowdown has mainly hit discretionary spending  retailers that deal in apparel and footwear   two sectors already feeling pressure   are hurting the most   NPD said makers of athletic wear popular with Hispanics  including  Nike  Inc  N NKE    Skechers USA Inc   N SKX  and Vans  N VFC   would take a big hit   It s certainly a good litmus test of how the holiday season is going to shake out   NPD analyst Marshal Cohen said  pointing to a double digit decline in back to school footwear sales  compared with a double digit increase last year   That s how powerful certain segments are  certainly the Hispanic market   Nielsen said sales of consumer essentials to Hispanics rose only 0 6 percent in the year ended July 1  compared with a 2 9 percent increase the prior year  and a 6 2 percent in the year before that  Some restaurants and food companies have remarked on signs that the worst is over for them  
 The Trump effect just on Hispanic foot traffic into the convenience store seems to have also dropped off a little bit   Rodney Sacks  chief executive of  Monster Beverage  Corp  O MNST   told analysts on an earnings call earlier this month ",2017-08-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-retailers-hit-as-immigration-worries-weigh-on-hispanic-spending-521916,521916

32798,254313,ORLY,Is Vanguard Value Index Investor  VIVAX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"Investors in search of a Large Cap Value fund might want to consider looking at Vanguard Value Index Investor  VIVAX   VIVAX has no Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  but we have been able to look into other metrics like performance  volatility  and cost 
Objective
VIVAX is classified in the Large Cap Value segment by Zacks  which is an area full of possibilities  Investors interested in a stable income stream fund these mutual funds very appealing because they have a unique investing strategy  Large Cap Value funds invest in stocks with a market capitalization of  10 billion or more  but whose share prices do not reflect their intrinsic value  This tactic often leads to low P E ratios and high dividend yields  however  these funds high growth opportunity are often slowed  as large cap securities are generally in stable industries with low to moderate growth prospects 
History of Fund Manager
VIVAX is a part of the Vanguard Group family of funds  a company based out of Malvern  PA  Vanguard Value Index Investor made its debut in November of 1992  and since then  VIVAX has accumulated about  315 96 million in assets  per the most up to date date available  Gerard C  O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY  is the fund s current manager and has held that role since December of 1994 
Performance
Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance  This fund in particular has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 9 55   and it sits in the top third among its category peers  Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3 year annualized total return of 11 24   which places it in the top third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  Over the past three years  VIVAX s standard deviation comes in at 11 99   compared to the category average of 10 13   Looking at the past 5 years  the fund s standard deviation is 11 64  compared to the category average of 10 24   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
It s always important to be aware of the downsides to any future investment  so one should not discount the risks that come with this segment  VIVAX lost 53 97  in the most recent bear market and underperformed its peer group by 3   These results could imply that the fund is a worse choice than its peers during a sliding market environment 
Investors should not forget about beta  an important way to measure a mutual fund s risk compared to the market as a whole  VIVAX has a 5 year beta of 0 94  which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average  Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration  since it represents a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark  which in this case  is the S P 500  VIVAX s 5 year performance has produced a negative alpha of  1 06  which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Exploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States 
Currently  this mutual fund is holding 89 04  stock in stocks  with an average market capitalization of  133 35 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Finance Technology Industrial Cyclical Health Turnover is 8   which means  on average  the fund makes fewer trades than its comparable peers Expenses
For investors  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is key  since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  Competition is heating up in this space  and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  all things being equal  In terms of fees  VIVAX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 17  compared to the category average of 0 99   VIVAX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost 
Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is  3 000 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at  1

32801,254316,ORLY,Is Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Investor  VTSMX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"If you re looking for an Index fund category  then a possible option is Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Investor  VTSMX   While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  we were able to examine other factors like performance  volatility  and cost 
History of Fund Manager
Vanguard Group is based in Malvern  PA  and is the manager of VTSMX  Since Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Investor made its debut in April of 1992  VTSMX has garnered more than  130 90 billion in assets  The fund s current manager  Gerard C  O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY   has been in charge of the fund since December of 1994 
Performance
Of course  investors look for strong performance in funds  This fund in particular has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 10 8   and is in the top third among its category peers  Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3 year annualized total return of 12 98   which places it in the top third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  Compared to the category average of 8 94   the standard deviation of VTSMX over the past three years is 12 43   The fund s standard deviation over the past 5 years is 12 24  compared to the category average of 9 31   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
It s always important to be aware of the downsides to any future investment  so one should not discount the risks that come with this segment  In the most recent bear market  VTSMX lost 50 89  and underperformed its peer group by 5   This could mean that the fund is a worse choice than comparable funds during a bear market 
Even still  the fund has a 5 year beta of 1 02  so investors should note that it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large  Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration  since it represents a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark  which in this case  is the S P 500  The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of  0 62  which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Exploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is mostly on equities that are traded in the United States 
Right now  98 43  of this mutual fund s holdings are stocks  with an average market capitalization of  173 12 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Technology Finance With turnover at about 3   this fund is making fewer trades than its comparable peers Expenses
Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  and particularly as competition heats up in this market  And all things being equal  a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors  In terms of fees  VTSMX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 14  compared to the category average of 0 76   VTSMX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost 
Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is  3 000 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at  1

32846,254361,ORLY,Is Vanguard Small Cap Growth Index Admiral  VSGAX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"Investors in search of an Index fund might want to consider looking at Vanguard Small Cap Growth Index Admiral  VSGAX   While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  we were able to examine other factors like performance  volatility  and cost 
History of Fund Manager
Vanguard Group is based in Malvern  PA  and is the manager of VSGAX  Vanguard Small Cap Growth Index Admiral debuted in September of 2011  Since then  VSGAX has accumulated assets of about  10 38 billion  according to the most recently available information  The fund s current manager  Gerard C  O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY   has been in charge of the fund since September of 2011 
Performance
Of course  investors look for strong performance in funds  This fund in particular has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 8 71   and is in the top third among its category peers  If you re interested in shorter time frames  do not dismiss looking at the fund s 3 year annualized total return of 15 76   which places it in the top third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  The standard deviation of VSGAX over the past three years is 15 02  compared to the category average of 8 45   Over the past 5 years  the standard deviation of the fund is 15 15  compared to the category average of 9 13   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
Investors should always remember the downsides to a potential investment  and this segment carries some risks one should be aware of 
Investors should note that the fund has a 5 year beta of 1 18  so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large  Another factor to consider is alpha  as it reflects a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark in this case  the S P 500  VSGAX s 5 year performance has produced a negative alpha of  3 22  which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is primarily on equities that are traded in the United States 
Right now  79 2  of this mutual fund s holdings are stocks  with an average market capitalization of  4 46 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Technology Finance Other Industrial Cyclical Health With turnover at about 22   this fund makes fewer trades than its comparable peers Expenses
Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  and particularly as competition heats up in this market  And all things being equal  a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors  In terms of fees  VSGAX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 07  compared to the category average of 0 76   So  VSGAX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective 
While the minimum initial investment for the product is  3 000  investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least  1

32885,254400,ORLY,Top Research Reports For Abbott  Netflix   Philip Morris ,opinion,"Friday  July 19  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Abbott  ABT   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Philip Morris  PM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Outperform rated Abbott s shares have gained  38 6  over the past year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has increased  6 4  over the same period  Abbott exited second quarter 2019 with better than expected earnings  However  revenues lagged the estimates  
The Zacks analyst likes the strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance  The company has been stealing the limelight within Diabetic Care on growth with FreeStyle Libre  This apart  synergies from Alere consolidation in the form of Rapid Diagnostics have been driving growth  Within Structural Heart  worldwide uptake of MitraClip therapy improves further 
Meanwhile  the company s emerging market performance has been promising  Consequently  Abbott has raised its full year guidance  On the flip side  sluggish Rhythm Management arm in the United States continues to dent growth  Increasing currency headwinds is another downside 
 You can   
Shares of Netflix have gained  21 5  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry s rally of  22 8  during the same period  Netflix s second quarter 2019 subscriber additions rate faltered primarily due to price hike in a number of regions and a weak content slate  
The company also blamed the record addition  9 million  of subscribers in the first quarter which resulted in a pull forward effect for the decline  Although Netflix provided an optimistic third quarter view  The Zacks analyst thinks the streaming giant will face hard times due to increasing competition in the video streaming space  
However  Netflix believes that lost shows will free up its budget that it can then spend on original content  Moreover  partnerships with Telefonica  MC TEF   KDDI  AT T  NYSE T   Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   DISH  Verizon  NYSE VZ   Charter  Altice  T Mobile and Sky bode well for the streaming platform 
 You can   
Philip Morris  shares have gained  4 1  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Tobacco industry  which has declined  1 1  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks sturdy bottom line trend along with efficient pricing and gains from growth of IQOS in the RRPs arena has been boosting the stock  
These upsides made a positive impact on second quarter results  wherein earnings and revenues beat expectations  Also  earnings improved year on year  Further  management raised its view for 2019  The company is on track to bolster the RRPs space and plans to invest nearly  400 million in this arena in 2019  
However  persistent softness in the cigarette unit is weighing on Philip Morris  top line performance  Cigarette shipment volumes are expected to continue declining in 2019  Conventional cigarettes are being weighed down by stringent policies and fading consumer interests  Moreover  unfavorable currency movements are a threat

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  3 43   A quarter ago  it was expected that this auto parts retailer would post earnings of  4 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 05  delivering a surprise of  0 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
O Reilly Automotive  which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  posted revenues of  2 59 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 57   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 46 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
O Reilly Automotive shares have added about 14  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for O Reilly Automotive 
While O Reilly Automotive has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for O Reilly Automotive was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

32888,254403,ORLY,Top Research Reports For Visa  Boeing   Coca Cola ,opinion,"Friday  April 26  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Visa  V   Boeing  BA  and Coca Cola  KO   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked Visa s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry in the past year  gaining  27 8  vs  a  25 2  increase  Visa s second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings beat estimates and was increased year over year  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company is gaining from consistent growth in payments volume  cross border volume and processed transactions  and a lower tax rate  Numerous strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing have paved the way for long term growth and consistent increase in revenues  
Visa is well poised to gain from growing electronic payment processing and a solid brand name  Its strong capital position enables investments in business  Nevertheless  high client incentives and operating expenses  and foreign exchange volatility might put pressure on margins 
 You can   
Shares of Boeing have gained  12 3  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  which has increased  1 8  during the same time period  Boeing s first quarter 2019 earnings and revenues surpassed their respective expectations  
However  both the metrics declined on a year over year basis  Also  its commercial business suffered a major setback in the first quarter  The Zacks analyst thinks this downturn can be attributed to lower 737 deliveries as 737 Max jets were grounded across the world following two fatal crashes in the recent past  Considering the solid prospects of the global commercial aviation services market  the company has bought KLX Aerospace in recent past  
The company is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world  Further  its strategic partnership with Embraer  once completed  is expected to strengthen Boeing s commercial business against its arch rival Airbus 
 You can   
Buy ranked Coca Cola s shares have gained  10 4  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry which has remained flat over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks this is largely attributable to the effective execution of strategies to evolve as a consumer centric total beverage company  This bolstered the company s quarterly performances as evident from a robust surprise trend  
First quarter 2019 marked its seventh positive earnings surprise in the last eight quarters and seventh straight sales beat  Top and bottom lines benefited from ongoing productivity efforts and disciplined growth strategies along with robust performance across all segments  Further  innovation and investment in core categories and brands have been the key focus area for Coca Cola  which has led to the expansion of retail value share  
Moreover  its transformative global re franchising initiatives are expected to boost margins  However  the company expects adverse currency rates to significantly hurt comparable revenues and operating income in the second quarter and 2019

32897,254412,ORLY,Is Vanguard Growth Index Admiral  VIGAX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"On the lookout for a Large Cap Growth fund  Starting with Vanguard Growth Index Admiral  VIGAX  is one possibility  VIGAX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1  Strong Buy   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance 
Objective
VIGAX is part of the Large Cap Growth section  and this segment boasts an array of other possible options  Large Cap Growth mutual funds purchase stakes in numerous large U S  companies that are expected to develop and grow at a faster rate than other large cap stocks  Companies are usually considered to be large cap if their market capitalization is over  10 billion 
History of Fund Manager
VIGAX finds itself in the Vanguard Group family  based out of Malvern  PA  Since Vanguard Growth Index Admiral made its debut in November of 2000  VIGAX has garnered more than  28 18 billion in assets  The fund s current manager  Gerard C  O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY   has been in charge of the fund since November of 2000 
Performance
Of course  investors look for strong performance in funds  This fund has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 11 63   and is in the middle third among its category peers  If you re interested in shorter time frames  do not dismiss looking at the fund s 3 year annualized total return of 15 05   which places it in the middle third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  VIGAX s standard deviation over the past three years is 12 61  compared to the category average of 10 41   The fund s standard deviation over the past 5 years is 12 64  compared to the category average of 10 23   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
One cannot ignore the volatility of this segment  however  as it is always important for investors to remember the downside to any potential investment  In VIGAX s case  the fund lost 47 12  in the most recent bear market and outperformed its peer group by 1 72   This means that the fund could possibly be a better choice than its peers during a down market environment 
Nevertheless  investors should also note that the fund has a 5 year beta of 1 08  which means it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large  Another factor to consider is alpha  as it reflects a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark in this case  the S P 500  With a negative alpha of  0 05  managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is primarily on equities that are traded in the United States 
The mutual fund currently has 90 01  of its holdings in stocks  which have an average market capitalization of  287 65 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Technology Retail Trade Non Durable This fund s turnover is about 20   so the fund managers are making fewer trades than the average comparable fund Expenses
As competition heats up in the mutual fund market  costs become increasingly important  Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart  a low cost product will be an outperformer  all other things being equal  Thus  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is vital for investors  In terms of fees  VIGAX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 05  compared to the category average of 1 05   Looking at the fund from a cost perspective  VIGAX is actually cheaper than its peers 
Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is  3 000 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at  1 
Bottom Line
Overall  Vanguard Growth Index Admiral   VIGAX   has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank  similar performance  average downside risk  and lower fees compared to its peers 
This could just be the start of your research on VIGAXin the Large Cap Growth category  Consider going to  for additional information about this fund  and all the others that we rank as well for additional information  If you are more of a stock investor  make sure to also check out our Zacks Rank  and our full suite of tools we have available for novice and professional investors alike ",2019-02-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-vanguard-growth-index-admiral-vigax-a-strong-mutual-fund-pick-right-now-200387920,200387920

32899,254414,ORLY,Is Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Admiral  VTSAX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"Investors in search of an Index fund might want to consider looking at Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Admiral  VTSAX   The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance  volatility  and cost 
History of Fund Manager
Vanguard Group is based in Malvern  PA  and is the manager of VTSAX  The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Admiral made its debut in November of 2000 and VTSAX has managed to accumulate roughly  202 15 billion in assets  as of the most recently available information  The fund is currently managed by Gerard C  O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY  who has been in charge of the fund since November of 2000 
Performance
Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance  This fund in particular has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 10 38   and it sits in the top third among its category peers  But if you are looking for a shorter time frame  it is also worth looking at its 3 year annualized total return of 14 21   which places it in the top third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  VTSAX s standard deviation over the past three years is 11 61  compared to the category average of 8 87   The fund s standard deviation over the past 5 years is 11 59  compared to the category average of 9   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
Investors cannot discount the risks to this segment though  as it is always important to remember the downside for any potential investment  VTSAX lost 50 84  in the most recent bear market and underperformed its peer group by 5 3   This could mean that the fund is a worse choice than comparable funds during a bear market 
Nevertheless  investors should also note that the fund has a 5 year beta of 1 02  which means it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large  Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration  since it represents a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark  which in this case  is the S P 500  Over the past 5 years  the fund has a negative alpha of  0 71  This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Exploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States 
Currently  this mutual fund is holding 99 22  stock in stocks  which have an average market capitalization of  202 79 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Technology Finance Industrial Cyclical Turnover is about 6   so those in charge of the fund make fewer trades than its comparable peers Expenses
As competition heats up in the mutual fund market  costs become increasingly important  Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart  a low cost product will be an outperformer  all other things being equal  Thus  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is vital for investors  In terms of fees  VTSAX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 04  compared to the category average of 0 74   So  VTSAX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective 
Investors need to be aware that with this product  the minimum initial investment is  3 000  each subsequent investment needs to be at least  1

32900,254415,ORLY,Retracement Anticipated For ORLY Stock,opinion,"In our previous article  we examined Advance Auto Parts stock through the prism of the Elliott Wave Principle  Today  we are going to take a look at another company in the same industry   O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY    whose ORLY stock exceeded  394 per share last month 
But it hasn t always been that easy for O Reilly bulls  Less than two years ago  in July 2017  the stock fell sharply to under  170 on the back of a disappointing same store sales guidance by the company  The stock lost 22  following the news 
Instead of losing hope  investors saw the plunge as a buying opportunity  which eventually led to the strong rally shown below 

As it often happens when you buy the bad news about otherwise strong companies  O Reilly s disappointment delivered very solid returns for those who had the courage to jump in  Unfortunately  no trend lasts forever 
The chart above shows that ORLY stock  s uptrend from  170 to  394 is a textbook five wave impulse pattern  It is labeled 1 2 3 4 5  where the sub waves of wave 1 are also visible and wave 4 is a triangle correction 
According to the Elliott Wave theory  a three wave correction in the opposite direction follows every impulse  This means that instead of waiting for even more gains  O Reilly shareholders should prepare for a notable decline to the support area near  290 
If this count is correct  the anticipated retracement can erase 20  of the company s market value  In addition  its P E ratio  currently at 22 3  also suggests ORLY stock is far from a bargain right now

32907,254422,ORLY,O Reilly Automotive  ORLY  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto parts retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 44 billion  up 6 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for O Reilly Automotive 
For O Reilly Automotive  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that O Reilly Automotive will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that O Reilly Automotive would post earnings of  3 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 72  delivering a surprise of  1 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
O Reilly Automotive doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oreilly-automotive-orly-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200407722,200407722

33009,254524,ORLY,O Reilly Automotive  ORLY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto parts retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 75 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 33 billion  up 6 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for O Reilly Automotive 
For O Reilly Automotive  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that O Reilly Automotive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that O Reilly Automotive would post earnings of  4 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 50  delivering a surprise of  4 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
O Reilly Automotive appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oreilly-automotive-orly-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200381254,200381254

33026,254541,ORLY,Top Analyst Reports For Bank Of America  Merck   Netflix ,opinion,"Monday  January 21  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Bank of America  BAC   Merck  MRK  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked Bank of America s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks in the past year  losing  8 2  vs   14 5   Also  the company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  beating expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  Its fourth quarter 2018 results were driven by rise in net interest income  lower operating expenses and decline in provisions  
The Zacks analyst thinks rise in loan and deposit balances  higher interest rates and efforts to control expenses will likely support profitability  While dismal performance of capital markets has been hurting the company s investment banking operations  its initiatives to expand into new markets and digital offerings are expected to further enhance cross selling opportunities  Also  the bank s steady capital deployments reflect a strong liquidity position 
 You can   
Shares of Buy ranked Merck have gained  23 9  in the past year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which has lost  0 8  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Merck s new products like Keytruda  Lynparza  and Bridion are contributing meaningfully to the top line  Keytruda sales are gaining momentum with approval for additional indications  especially in the first line lung cancer setting as it is the only anti PD 1 approved in this setting  
Animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck  Meanwhile  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line  However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line  
Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine  remains  Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q4 results  Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters 
 You can   
Netflix s shares have increased  49  in the past year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry s gain of  9  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Netflix s fourth quarter 2018 subscriber addition rate reflects growing appeal of the streaming platform  which is primarily driven by a solid content portfolio  This is also helping the company counter competition from the likes of HBO  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime video and YouTube  
Moreover  partnerships with telcos like Telefonica  MC TEF  in Spain  KDDI in Japan  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  and T Mobile in the United States  and Sky in the U K  and Germany are expected to drive subscriber addition  However  management s weak guidance for U S  streaming paid net additions for the first quarter of 2019 is expected drag down shares  
Netflix s decision to raise prices is likely to boost top line growth and offset increasing marketing expenditure  However  continuing cash burn and huge debt level are primary concerns

33031,254546,ORLY,Is Vanguard Value Index Admiral  VVIAX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"If investors are looking at the Large Cap Value fund category  Vanguard Value Index Admiral  VVIAX  could be a potential option  VVIAX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1  Strong Buy   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance 
Objective
Large Cap Value mutual funds invest in stocks with a market capitalization of  10 billion or more  but whose share prices do not reflect their intrinsic value  this value investing strategy often leads to low P E ratios and high dividend yields  though growth levels are often curtailed  The high growth opportunity of these funds are slowed even further  as large cap securities are generally in stable industries with low to moderate growth prospects  Therefore  Large Cap Value funds are usually more appealing to investors who are interested in a stable income stream 
History of Fund Manager
Vanguard Group is based in Malvern  PA  and is the manager of VVIAX  Since Vanguard Value Index Admiral made its debut in November of 2000  VVIAX has garnered more than  17 43 billion in assets  The fund s current manager  Gerard C  O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY   has been in charge of the fund since November of 2000 
Performance
Of course  investors look for strong performance in funds  This fund carries a 5 year annualized total return of 10 28   and it sits in the top third among its category peers  Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3 year annualized total return of 11 13   which places it in the top third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  VVIAX s standard deviation over the past three years is 9 11  compared to the category average of 8 96   The fund s standard deviation over the past 5 years is 9 7  compared to the category average of 9 19   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
Investors cannot discount the risks to this segment though  as it is always important to remember the downside for any potential investment  In the most recent bear market  VVIAX lost 53 91  and underperformed its peer group by 3 21   This makes the fund a possibly worse choice than its peers during a sliding market environment 
Investors should not forget about beta  an important way to measure a mutual fund s risk compared to the market as a whole  VVIAX has a 5 year beta of 0 93  which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average  Another factor to consider is alpha  as it reflects a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark in this case  the S P 500  The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of  0 18  which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States 
Right now  85 03  of this mutual fund s holdings are stocks  and these companies have an average market capitalization of  163 15 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Finance Technology With turnover at about 18   this fund is making fewer trades than the average comparable fund Expenses
As competition heats up in the mutual fund market  costs become increasingly important  Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart  a low cost product will be an outperformer  all other things being equal  Thus  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is vital for investors  In terms of fees  VVIAX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 05  compared to the category average of 1 03   VVIAX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost 
Investors need to be aware that with this product  the minimum initial investment is  10 000  each subsequent investment needs to be at least  1 
Bottom Line
Overall  Vanguard Value Index Admiral   VVIAX   has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank  and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance  average downside risk  and lower fees  this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now

gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing  Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that

33091,254606,ORLY,Is O Reilly Automotive  ORLY  Outperforming Other Retail Wholesale Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Retail Wholesale space have likely heard of O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Retail Wholesale peers  we might be able to answer that question 
O Reilly Automotive is a member of the Retail Wholesale sector  This group includes 228 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of  5  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  ORLY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORLY s full year earnings has moved 1 26  higher  This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend 
According to our latest data  ORLY has moved about 47 27  on a year to date basis  Meanwhile  the Retail Wholesale sector has returned an average of 3 29  on a year to date basis  This means that O Reilly Automotive is performing better than its sector in terms of year to date returns 
Looking more specifically  ORLY belongs to the Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  a group that includes 5 individual stocks and currently sits at  2 in the Zacks Industry Rank  Stocks in this group have gained about 30 28  so far this year  so ORLY is performing better this group in terms of year to date returns 
Investors in the Retail Wholesale sector will want to keep a close eye on ORLY as it attempts to continue its solid performance ",2018-11-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-oreilly-automotive-orly-outperforming-other-retailwholesale-stocks-this-year-200361118,200361118
33092,254607,ORLY,Is Vanguard REIT Index Investor  VGSIX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"Looking for an Index fund  You may want to consider Vanguard REIT Index Investor  VGSIX  as a possible option  While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  we were able to examine other factors like performance  volatility  and cost 
History of Fund Manager
Vanguard Group is based in Malvern  PA  and is the manager of VGSIX  The Vanguard REIT Index Investor made its debut in May of 1996 and VGSIX has managed to accumulate roughly  1 94 billion in assets  as of the most recently available information  The fund is currently managed by Gerard C  O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY  who has been in charge of the fund since May of 1996 
Performance
Of course  investors look for strong performance in funds  This fund in particular has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 8 46   and it sits in the middle third among its category peers  But if you are looking for a shorter time frame  it is also worth looking at its 3 year annualized total return of 6 79   which places it in the middle third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  The standard deviation of VGSIX over the past three years is 12 57  compared to the category average of 8 85   Looking at the past 5 years  the fund s standard deviation is 13 51  compared to the category average of 8 8   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
It s always important to be aware of the downsides to any future investment  so one should not discount the risks that come with this segment  In the most recent bear market  VGSIX lost 64 54  and outperformed its peer group by 17 99   This might suggest that the fund is a better choice than its peers during a bear market 
Nevertheless  investors should also note that the fund has a 5 year beta of 0 51  which means it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large  Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration  since it represents a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark  which in this case  is the S P 500  VGSIX s 5 year performance has produced a positive alpha of 1 92  which means managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Expenses
For investors  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is key  since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  Competition is heating up in this space  and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  all things being equal  In terms of fees  VGSIX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 26  compared to the category average of 0 85   VGSIX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost 
This fund requires a minimum initial investment of  3 000  and each subsequent investment should be at least  1

Commentary The stock market soared  but AT40  T2108  and AT200  T2107   respectively the percentage of stocks trading above their 40 and 200 day moving averages  DMAs   only gained a few percentage points and failed to reverse the previous day s loss  This combination is a sign of just how much technical damage has been done to the market 

The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gapped up and closed with a 1 9  gain but well off intraday highs 
Also note that the S P 500 s 200DMA turned downward for the second straight day  As a reminder  this critical long term trendline last declined on a daily basis in May  2016  
The NASDAQ gapped up significantly and closed with a 3 0  gain but well off intraday highs  

The Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ  gapped up significantly and closed with a 3 5  gain  More importantly  QQQ faded from 200DMA resistance 
The volatility index  the VIX  dropped just 4 0  after a rebound off its low  The fear gauge still looks poised to go higher before the next volatility implosion 

The volatility index  the VIX  maintained its uptrend from the recent low with a rebound off its intraday low 
The currency markets are flashing new dangers in the form of the Australia dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY   Overnight  AUD JPY plunged and broke the important September low and hit a near 2 year low  At the time of writing  AUD JPY bounced just enough to recover that low  As a reminder  AUD JPY can provide an important tell on the market s current risk tolerance  Right now  it looks like that tolerance just got a lot lower 

AUD JPY plunged at one point to a near 2 year low while breaking through critical support from September  Source  Trading View
Focusing on the bullish opportunities is still paying off with call options on SPY  I expected to hold the two tranches I bought into Wednesday s sell off until next week  but the S P 500 soared enough to move me to take profits  in other words  I did not want to risk losing the profits to another swoosh lower that fades the day s strong rally   I will continue to exercise oversold trading rules in buying SPY call options  essentially buying when the S P 500 plunges along with a surge spike in volatility  
With the oversold period stretched into essentially 11 days  the second derivative of the stock market is in full swing  As I prepare for a more extended oversold period of churn and 200DMA resistance levels holding firm  I am back to hedging in small bits  Per the strategy I laid out on Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   I faded its rally Wednesday  I sold a call spread expiring Friday 
With Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc  NASDAQ GOOG  and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  earnings pulling down big cap tech in after hours  it looks like my trade will work out  I also wanted to buy a calendar put spread on NFLX  but my order never filled  As another hedge  I bought a single put option on Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  expiring Friday  To avoid swinging myself to the bearish side  I added call options on Splunk Inc  NASDAQ SPLK  expiring next week 
CHART REVIEWS
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  AAPL is still the north star for tech stocks  The calamity in the rest of the market has yet to hit AAPL much  With earnings next week  I was bracing for a major test for the stock and the rest of the stock market  The poor response to GOOG and AMZN earnings may deliver the test ahead of schedule 

Apple  AAPL  continued its pivot around its 50DMA as it holds a trading range 
Align Technology Inc  NASDAQ ALGN  ALGN collapsed in the wake of its earnings on extremely high trading volume  a 16 month high   The loss of 20 2  took ALGN to an 8 month low  In less than a month  ALGN lost its entire gain for 2018  This kind of punishment for high flying  high valuation stocks is more technical damage to add to the growing carnage 

Align Technology  ALGN  confirmed its 200DMA breakdown with a post earnings gap down and a 20 2  loss 
Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  GG took me aback with a 18 7  post earnings loss that took the stock all the way back to early 2002 levels  My whole experience on miners has taught me to just stick with the yellow metal itself  The miners just add unnecessary operational risk  I am dumping my position soon  When  if   the stock closes this post earnings gap down  I will reconsider my positioning 

Goldcorp  GG  lost 18 7  on a massive post earnings loss  The stock is at a 16  year low 
Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH  MTH reported earnings on the right day  The stock received some serious tailwinds to the tune of a 9 5  gain  The next test for the stock is resistance from its steeply downtrending 20DMA  If sentiment is truly turning around  buyers will soon slice right through this resistance  Otherwise  it will be back to the same ol  fade 

Meritage Homes  MTH  soared 9 5  post earnings  The stock closed with a small fade from the downtrending 20DMA 
O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY  ORLY printed an intriguing pattern going into earnings  It slowly sagged as its 20 and 50DMAs converged  The stock dropped 5 1  ahead of earnings and gapped down following earnings  This trading action looks too much like topping action  so this is a dip I will NOT buy this time around 

Oreilly Automotive  ORLY  sagged into earnings and barely closed flat after a strong fade from post earnings highs 
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  Another week  another whacky set of events for TSLA  While the stock market sank this week  TSLA soared  A dramatic pop of 14 2  occurred on the heels of TSLA announcing it would deliver earnings a week earlier than originally planned  Even Citron caught on to the bullish implications 

Sure enough  TSLA delivered earnings results that pleased the market  The stock finished with a 9 1  gain and a 200DMA breakout  However  sellers did manage to push the stock back to the previous day s intraday high at one point  The drama caught me flat footed as I was positioning for a bullish pre earnings play the NEXT week  While things worked out OK  I could have easily been caught with a pre earnings warning  This drama just reminded me of the whacky  upside and downside  risks inherent in trading this stock  Going forward  the stock still has major overhead resistance in the mid 300s  I am also still not interested in holding the stock for an extended period until I see what happens after TSLA s next funding round 


Tesla  TSLA  printed a 200DMA gap up post earnings  Yet at one point it managed to fade all the way to the previous day s intraday high 

Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  After seeing TWTR pop 15 5  post earnings  I heaved a major sigh of relief  The bullish case remains intact for TWTR  and I will certainly use weakness from general stock market malaise to add to my position 


Twitter  TWTR  gained 15 5  post earnings but faded from 200DMA resistance

33207,254722,ORLY,25 Stocks Powering The  300B SPY ETF For 25 Years,opinion,The world s largest and the ultra popular large cap ETF  SPDR S P 500 ETF Trust   AX SPY    has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary  This is because it has become the first ETF with  300 billion in AUM  Though SPY s inception date is Jan 22  1993  it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29  1993  read    Inside The ETFSPY  NYSE SPY  tracks the S P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket  with each security holding no more than 3 62   This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration About one fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector  which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market  Moreover  financials  health care  consumer discretionary and industrials  each of which accounts for a double digit exposure  are also performing remarkably well The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71 6 million shares a day on average  This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid ask spread  leading to lower trading costs for investors  see    Factors Driving SPYThe U S  stock market is in the midst of the second longest bull run in history  Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better than expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts  This  coupled with Trump s pro growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth  reducing regulation  increasing spending  slashing taxes  and boosting jobs and corporate profits  are bolstering optimism in the economy Since Trump s win  the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936  according to Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research  the S P 500 rally during Trump s first year is the third best since World War II  behind only President George H  W  Bush and President John F  Kennedy  read    Further  a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices  a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the

33208,254723,ORLY,Why Earnings Season Could Be Great For O Reilly Automotive  ORLY ,opinion,Automotive  Inc    NASDAQ ORLY   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because O Reilly Automotiveis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORLY in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  2 79 per share for ORLY  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 78 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORLY  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  0 50  heading into earnings season O Reilly Automotive  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that ORLY has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for O Reilly Automotive  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-earnings-season-could-be-great-for-oreilly-automotive-orly-200287027,200287027
33243,254758,ORLY,A Fresh Market Surge Barely Moves An Important Needle,opinion,"AT40   59 3  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   57 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   9 8  a 13 3  drop Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary Buyers ended last week on a strong note with the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   surging to yet another all time high  The move quickly invalidated the bearish engulfing pattern that started the week on a sour note 


The S P 500 is back in top bullish form with a fresh all time high 
While the S P 500 gained a respectable 0 8   the NASDAQ soared 2 2  and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  surged 2 9   Both tech laden representatives hit fresh all time closing highs  Tech earnings were in full effect to produce the bulk of the day s celebration  The volatility index  the VIX  added to the bullish feeling by imploding all over again for a 13 3  loss 
The volatility index plunged back toward its record low 
Yet  for all the bullish ripples on the surface  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs  only gained three percentage points to close at 59 3   This small move of the needle suggests that Friday s advance was relatively narrow  I am not overly surprised since big cap techs were all the rage on the day  I will be looking for the rally to broaden this week with AT40 even challenging the overbought threshold  70    The biggest wildcard looks like the Federal Reserve s meeting on Wednesday  November 1st 
STOCK CHART REVIEWS
Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  AMZN was the clear star of the day as it not only drove up the tech indices but helped motivate buyers across big cap tech  The stock gapped up above its closing all time high and never looked back  After the dust settled  the post earnings move produced a whopping 13 2  gain  I failed to execute my  buy AMZN at the post earnings open  trade  Clearly  it would have been a tremendous winner this time around 
Amazon com  AMZN  gained 13 2  with an explosive move that invalidated all at once July s post earnings blow off top and the bearish engulfing from earlier in the month 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  AAPL s got next on the earnings front  November 2  2017   In the middle of iPhone X news  traders and investors took their cues from big cap tech and rushed to get in ahead of the earnings report  AAPL gained an amazing 3 6   I was sitting on a single call option as a part of my trade for the week  When AAPL gapped up  I was quite happy to lock in my profits when the stock traded around  160  I of course did not even begin to imagine the kind of day AAPL ended up experiencing  Needless to say  I am going into the current week AAPL less 

Apple  AAPL  closed right under its all time closing high from late August 
Intel  NASDAQ INTC  I have been in the habit of loading up on INTC call options between earnings  waiting for a dip to make the first buys  I think Friday s historic 7 4  post earnings gap up makes it highly unlikely I will get a comfortable entry point to make such trades this upcoming cycle  INTC closed at a 17 year high 

Intel Corporation surged to a 17 year high as investors and traders cheered the latest earnings news 
O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  In my last Above the 40 post  I lamented that a poor after hours response to earnings from ORLY signaled the likely end of the bottoming of auto parts plays  So imagine my surprise when buyers stepped in right at the gap down on the open  ORLY has yet to look back and has managed to turn defeat into a ringing confirmation of a bottoming process underway 
O Reilly Automotive made a stunning post earnings come back as it rallied from a gap down of 5 3  to a GAIN of 5 6  
Logitech  NASDAQ LOGI  With tech coming on strong again  I am eyeing LOGI closely  The stock tumbled after earnings last week  but it refuses to buckle beneath its 200DMA support  LOGI could be signaling a buying opportunity with a clear stop below  33 75 

Logitech  LOGI  has churned since late May  Since then  the stock has formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern  the head is from the huge surge and subsequent deep gap down in late July  and started a struggle to hold 200DMA support

As far as the market  I couldn t be less excited  This is pretty much as bad as it gets for an ursine soul like myself   lifetime highs everywhere  a raging small caps market  and a VIX in the single digits  Absolutely soul crushing 
I m not the sort of give up  ummm    obviously  and I have  in fact  put together five options positions based on one simple premise  I ll get to the premise later 
For now  let me show you the five positions in question  They all have these elements in common   1  I own puts against them  2  the puts are in the money  3  the options expiration is way out in January 19 2018  at least   giving me tons of time 
So here they are    the Russell 2000 

Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  

Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  

O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY  

And finally the Consumer Discretionary ETF 

So what s the premise  Simple  the notion over the next three and a half months absolutely nothing of consequence will happen to equities strikes me as profoundly unlikely  These options are certainly priced for perfection and for  all quiet  
I m taking the opposite side  while I realize that there hasn t been even a 5  dip in equities for twenty months now          it seems to me  at these lofty heights  that something   anything    is prone to happen given a timespan of over a quarter of a year

33261,254776,ORLY,The S P 500 Wavers Its Way Into A Close Call,opinion,"AT40   57 2  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   56 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   11 2  was as high as 13 2 Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary It took three days for the volatility faders to show up again  Nerves in volatility trading stretched for a third day with the VIX trading as high as 13 2 and a 18 3  gain  The VIX ended the action with a fraction of a percent to call a gain 

The volatility index  the VIX  has not traded three straight days to the upside since the first surge in August 
Always wary of the fleeting gains in going long volatility  I locked in a double on my call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   While this gain on my latest tranche of UVXY calls was gratifying it ended a losing streak in place since September  The month was surprisingly placid and laid consistent waste to my once every two week UVXY hedges  It was a marked contrast to the small profits I eked out in August and the beginning of September 
The surge in volatility was large enough to flag a major sell off  Yet  the S P 500 barely lost 1  at its lowest point on the day  The index closed with a 0 5  loss  The recovery was important for my trading call  As I indicated in my last Above the 40 post  I planned to flip the short term trading call all the way to cautiously bearish if the S P 500 closed below last week s low  As the chart below shows  the S P 500 turned in a close call 

The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   sliced through the previous week s low before buyers rushed in to avoid a bearish breakdown 
Given the major fade of volatility  I am inclined to believe that sellers have exhausted themselves  However  the underlying weakness in the market remains  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   dropped from 62 8  to 57 2   This level is still far from oversold  20   or  close enough  to oversold  low 30 s   The new bearish turning point is now a close for the S P 500 below today s intraday low  2 544   AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200 DMAs  dropped to a 1 month low 
I find it instructive to note how another bearish divergence resolved into a sell off  It was shallow  again  but sharp enough to  feel  significant  This time around I changed my approach from trying to anticipate the timing of the imminent selling and instead prepared to buy in the wake of that selling 
The NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   each tumbled similarly  The intraday recovery for QQQ was a bit more convincing 
The NASDAQ recovered sharply off its low but still closed below its 20DMA uptrend 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  recovered sharply to regain its 20DMA uptrend 
The selling was strong enough to push the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  into its own bearish engulfing topping pattern  I promptly closed out my XLF call options to preserve my remaining profits on the position 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  printed its own topping pattern 
STOCK CHART REVIEWS
Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  CMG was my biggest pain of the day  Earnings finally arrived  and the response was far uglier than I feared  I was hoping  300 established itself as a relatively strong support  Instead  it will likely now serve as resistance  I will once again stop out of a small position in shares  Per plan  I did not attempt a pre earnings play with options  a simple put spread would have been quite profitable   
The bad news just keeps gushing out for Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG   It closed with a 14 6  post earnings loss 
International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Investors greeted IBM s earnings last week with great cheer  It was enough to erase the loss from July s earnings and challenge the April gap down all in one swoop  The shine came off big time this week as IBM has suffered three days of sharp losses  Its bullish 200DMA breakout is over and now I wonder whether it will close its up gap to earn an award for relief rally of the year 
The tremendous relief in International Business Machines  IBM  is proving quite temporary 
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  The day s selling was even strong enough to take CAT off its post earnings perch  At its low of the day  I thought CAT was on its way to filling in its incredible up gap  The stock remains quite stretched as it sits on its upper Bollinger Band  BB  

Can Caterpillar  CAT  hold onto its latest post earnings celebration  The stock may be a buy near or at the lower edge of its upper BB trading channel 
Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  Despite continued momentum in housing stocks  WHR stumbled mightily post earnings  A second day of post earnings selling stretched the stock further below its lower BB  This selling looks like it confirmed a top in WHR as the stock separates downward from a head and shoulders type of pattern  not shown in the chart below  

Whirlpool  WHR  trades in wild swings  The latest downward push my be the beginning of more selling to come as the stock prints a topping pattern on the double breakdown from 200 and 50DMA supports 
3M Company  NYSE MMM  MMM defied the sellers and gravity as the stock pushed further beyond its upper BB  The post earnings surge and follow through makes MMM a buy on the dip whenever THAT happens 
3M Company  MMM  now stands out as an old line industrial stock that stubbornly resisted the wave of sellers and displayed great relative strength 
In other news  O Reilly Auto Parts  NASDAQ ORLY  got hammered in after hours post earnings trading  The 7  loss will no doubt take down peers and throw into question the nascent comeback for these stocks

33300,254815,ORLY,Jazz Pharmaceuticals  O Reilly Automotive And Tesla Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 5  2017    Jazz Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ    NASDAQ JAZZ     as the Bull of the Day  O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ    NASDAQ ORLY      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTesla Inc   NASDAQ    NASDAQ TSLA      Here is a synopsis of all three stocks   Jazz Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ     is a  9 billion drug company focused on developing and commercializing innovative products to meet unmet medical needs in neurology  psychiatry  and oncology On August 8  Jazz reported a weaker than expected quarter and guidance which knocked the shares down from  155 to  140  But I was licking my chops at the opportunity to buy this key franchise trading at just 11X next year s projected EPS of  13  This article will explain why First  you have to understand where JAZZ has been successful  Their top commercially successful drug is Xyrem for the treatment of narcolepsy  Xyrem will comprise nearly 75  of JAZZ s total projected sales this year of  1 64 billion JAZZ s second most important revenue generator is Erwinaze  part of a chemotherapy program to treat patients who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or ALL  a type of blood cancer that affects the white blood cells that help fight infection  Erwinaze is used in patients who have had an allergic reaction to a different type of asparaginase treatment Erwinaze is an alternate form of asparaginase  It is thought to help prevent leukemia cells from surviving and works in a similar way as other asparaginase treatments And Erwinaze is part of the oncology pipeline that JAZZ is expanding rapidly and holds the most promise as JAZZ brings new drugs to market and reduces dependence on Xyrem for growth Reaction to Q2 Report Overwhelmed by New FDA ApprovalWells Fargo  NYSE WFC  analyst Ike Bucherow reiterated his Outperform rating on shares of JAZZ and trimmed his price target just a half percent  to  177 from  178  after the company reported Q2 EPS of  2 56  missing the consensus of  2 75  and missing on the top line too by about  10 million The analyst stated  revenues were lighter than what we expected  spending in line with our expectations  resulting in EPS lower than we forecast  but nothing seems to be significantly astray  Jazz reaffirmed its full year revenue guidance of  1 625 billion to  1 7 billion  But it was the news of August 3 that most large biopharma investors were focused on That day  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approved the Jazz Pharmaceuticals drug Vyxeos for the treatment of adults with two types of acute myeloid leukemia  AML   a rapidly progressing and life threatening blood cancer  Vyxeos is a fixed combination of chemotherapy drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine Designed with Jazz s CombiPlex proprietary technology  Vyxeos is a unique liposomal formulation that delivers a fixed ratio of daunorubicin and cytarabine to the bone marrow that has been shown to have synergistic effects at killing leukemia cells in vitro and in animal models   Vyxeos is the first product developed with the company s proprietary CombiPlex platform  which enables the design and rapid evaluation of various combinations of therapies  Vyxeos is the first new chemotherapy advance in more than 40 years for adults with newly diagnosed therapy related AML or AML with myelodysplasia related changes   said Bruce Cozadd  chairman and chief executive officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals   The FDA approval of Vyxeos reflects our commitment to addressing unmet needs within the hematology oncology community   O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ     is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts  tools  supplies  equipment  and accessories in the US  serving both professional service providers and do it yourself customers Since I m a Chicago boy who grew up with NAPA auto parts stores  I ve still never set foot in an O Reilly shop and was surprised to find they now operate 4 935 stores in 47 states  And  as further testament to my ignorance of this great business story  they started in Springfield  MO in 1957  going public in 1993   History of a Great American Immigrant SuccessWhile ORLY is a Zacks  5 Rank Strong Sell because estimates dropped sharply after weak sales comps in July  I want to share a little about this amazing growth story in case you were as ignorant as I was  We ll come back to the company and stock outlook in a moment I borrow this little bit of history from the company website   Michael Byrne O Reilly immigrated to America in 1849  escaping from the hard times of the potato famine  which struck Ireland in 1845 46  Settling in St  Louis  he worked his way through school to earn a law degree  and then pursued a career as a title examiner  His son  Charles Francis O Reilly  attended college in St  Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St  Louis By 1924  Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area  having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory  He recognized the region as an area of growth and opportunity and asked to be transferred there  By 1932  he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield  One of his sons  Charles H   Chub  O Reilly  had also joined the company  Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area In 1957  Link planned a reorganization  which would have included the retirement of 72 year old Charles F  O Reilly  and the transfer of C  H  O Reilly to Kansas City  Since neither agreed with these plans  they made the decision to form their own company  O Reilly Automotive  Inc  end of history excerpt from O Reilly website From those humble beginnings  father and son created a business legacy that an any immigrant patriarch would be proud of Now  let s get back to why this company  whose shares have soared from  80 to  290 in four years  summer 2012 to summer 2016   are down 29  YTD  My colleague Neena Mishra wrote about ORLY as the Bull of the Day back in July after their sales comps report and before their Q2 earnings report  Here s what she said then   Shares Plunge After Weak Sales ResultsOn July 5  the company reported its Q2 comparable store sales results  which were much weaker than expected   The stock fell almost 20  and is down about 34  year to date  actually trading down to  170 after that report   After exiting the first quarter and entering April on an improved sales trend  we faced a more challenging sales environment than we expected for the remainder of the quarter  Our second quarter comparable store sales results of 1 7  represent an improvement over our first quarter  but fell below our guidance of 3  to 5   due to what we believe were continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand   said the CEO Falling EstimatesAnalysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak guidance   Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have fallen to  11 83 per share and  13 10 per share from  12 26 and  13 73 respectively  30 days back The company has missed in three out of past four quarters  The average negative quarterly surprise for the past four quarters is 2 3  Additional content Tesla Hit with Labor Board ComplaintThe Oakland regional office of the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against electric car giant Tesla Inc   NASDAQ      on Thursday  claiming the automaker interfered with its employees  union activities at Tesla s Fremont  California manufacturing factory The NLRB complaint reaches back to claims made in April  when the United Automobile Workers union filed four separate charges with the board claiming that Tesla had  illegally surveilled and coerced factory workers attempting to distribute information about the union drive   The complaint filed yesterday by the NLRB provides more details on what happened earlier this year  noting things like security guards asking employees distributing pamphlets to show employee ID cards  then proceeding to tell them to leave factory premises  to naming three individual Tesla managers who questioned employees about union activities or tries to prevent employees from talking about union activities NLRB s complaint also cites Tesla s restrictive confidentiality agreement  a document that prohibited employees from organizing or discussing their work condition   While Tesla argues that this document is typical of any tech company  California lawmakers  the company back in February that the agreement was overreaching Based on these findings  NLRB regional director Valerie Hardy Mahoney wrote that the automaker  has been interfering with  restraining and coercing employees in the exercise of their rights  Tesla has stood firm in its dismissal of the UAW s allegations  saying  For seven years  the UAW has used every tool in its playbook  misleading and outright false communications  unsolicited and unwelcomed visits to the homes of our employees  attempts to discredit Tesla publicly in the media  and now another tactic that has been used in every union campaign since the beginning of time    These allegations  which have been filed by the same contingent of union organizers who have been so outspoken with media  are entirely without merit  We will obviously be responding as part of the NLRB process   Tesla continued The NLRB s complaint is likely the last thing Tesla wants  especially as production on its highly anticipated Model 3 begins to ramp up  CEO Elon Musk already warned investors  however  that the electric car maker may face some manufacturing challenges in the coming months The board s complaint is set to be reviewed by an administrative law judge at a hearing next week One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and

33374,254889,ORLY,The Week Ahead  Time To Rebuild The Wall Of Worry ,opinion,"As some market worries have been put to rest  there is a growing appetite for new ones  Pundits who say that things look OK are not very exciting  Last week we saw a shift in attention  Despite healthy earnings and good economic data  I expect pundits to be asking 
What should investors be worried about 
Last Week
Last week the economic news was good  but mostly ignored 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted a week focused on geopolitical risks  Despite some attention to earnings  economic data  and the latest Trump Administration pronouncements  that proved to be a reasonable guess 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at an S P 500 chart of market performance for the week  There was little change  The Thursday rebound was attributed to comments suggesting quicker movement on a tax reform package  If we measure the gain from the prior week s close it is about 0 80  

Whatever the news  the net market effect was  once again  very small 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Once again  the economic news last week was good  The market got a little boost 
The Good
Trucking data is improving despite the mixed headline data  Steven Hansen    explains 
Mortgage delinquencies declined to an 11 year low     
Industrial production rose 0 5   Eddy Elfenbein notes the weakness in factories and the strength in utilities Tim Duy also takes a closer look  noting the weakness in autos and the strength in utilities  He also cites the American interest in larger cars 

Q1 Earnings  that reports are beating the historical metrics   calls attention to the lag in energy stocks  Here is the key quote from John Butters 
To date  6  of the companies in the S P 500 have reported actual results for Q1 2017  In terms of earnings  more companies  76   are reporting actual EPS above estimates compared to the 5 year average  In aggregate  companies are reporting earnings that are 6 7  above the estimates  which is also above the 5 year average  In terms of sales  more companies  59   are reporting actual sales above estimates compared to the 5 year average  In aggregate  companies are reporting sales that are 0 2  above estimates  which is also above the 5 year average 



And fewer companies are citing President Trump as a factor  It is a small sample so far  but interesting to watch 

Philly Fed remained strong with a reading of 22  This is especially good for a diffusion index  which measures month over month changes  We cannot expect the pace of increases to be maintained  Few understand this and fewer mention it 
Initial jobless claims rose to 244K  which some may see as bad  Most follow this noisy series via the four week moving average  which moved lower 
Existing home sales were up 4 4    notes that warmer weather was a factor  Bill also expects increasing inventory  which will help future sales 
Chinese economic growth was 6 9   beating expectations    
The Bad
Hotel occupancy rates declined by 4 6    and notes the possible effect of a shift in Easter from March in 2016 to April in 2017 
Housing starts declined from February  but increased 9 2  over last year s easy comparison  Overall  starts are up 8 1  YTD   is sticking with a forecast of a 3  to 7  gain for the year  Check out the post for a solid discussion of this difficult series 

The Ugly
Following up on an item from last year  cell phone use by drivers is nearly universal   that the phones are used in 88  of trips 
 to make money on the team s stock options is also ugly 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  but nominations are always welcome  There are many bogus claims and charts out there 
This week I was especially disappointed with coverage   even by mainstream media   of the  on world financial risk  From most of the stories you would never know that risk had decreased  One major source even reposted a typical ZH piece   no links  poor writing  extensive quotes without citations  etc  Sadly  many more people read this than the original report or any unbiased accounts 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a normal week for economic data 
The  A  List
Consumer confidence  T   Expect some decline from record levels 
Michigan sentiment  F   A good read on employment and economic well being 
New home sales  T   Continuing strength needed in this important sector 
Q1 GDP  F   This first estimate will be revised  perhaps heavily  but will still grab attention 
Initial jobless claims  Th   Is the series edging up from record low levels 
The  B  List
Pending home sales  Th   Not as important for economic expansion is new sales  but still a good market read 
Durable goods  Th   March data  but still important 
Employment cost index  F   A sign of labor market tightening 
Chicago PMI  F   Most important of the regional indexes  especially when the national report is in following week 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
The schedule is light on FedSpeak  but there will be plenty of earnings news 
Next Week s Theme
In a normal week  the Q1 earnings season would continue as our theme  While dramatic moves in some stocks grab attention  the overall market interest emphasizes what to worry about  Since some of the recent problems do not seem as threatening  it is time for a fresh supply  Expect many to be asking 
What should investors be worried about 
There are four leading candidates 
A government shutdown  Action is needed by the end of the week  Ever changing rumors suggest that the vote will be linked to an ObamaCare repeal or some other topic  Expect this to get plenty of attention all week  since these issues are never resolved until the deadline 
The French election  It s a revolution no matter which front runner wins  says a French political scientist and adviser to a former Prime Minister      It could lead to rioting     
The Trump agenda is in jeopardy  The President and his team have a business approach  but often do not recognize legal and political limitations  Some were disturbed by the   where the President did not understand the laws related to trade agreements   despite an explanation repeated ten times   The   
Market valuation  This multi year topic got a fresh boost this week  The concept of an expensive market is now conventional wisdom  It implies that long term investors are stupid  dumb money  and facing excessive risk  Just as they have been for years   about a crash  according to Goldman 
These are very important questions  Understanding a  wall of worry  is a fundamental concept for investors  Many think that a list of worries is bad  That is wrong  Well documented concerns are reflected in current pricing  I tried to explain this concept in 2009 

Many observers express surprise that the market can rally in spite of  the fundamentals  


This is the wrong question  The best time to invest is when things look terrible and prices reflect the poor current conditions  I wrote an article on this topic in mid April of 2009 that I thought was   A commenter  probably reflecting many others  offered a skeptical  Good luck with that   It is difficult  unpopular  and profitable to have a bullish market viewpoint when the general news flow is so negative 


 How can stocks rally with so much to worry about  To answer this question you need to consider what these lists would have been like a month ago  Some of the worries have been crossed off  Others have been reduced 


The crash of the Euro  the sovereign debt crisis  and the  cockroach theory  have not come to pass 


Corporate earnings have remained strong   both current and prospective   despite skepticism 


None of the extreme  technical  forecasts   Hindenburg Omen  head and shoulders top  Death Cross  or Dow Theory signals came to pass  Some are now reversing 


If you watch the lists of worries as they change over time  you can see that some important concerns drop off  This climbing of the  wall of worry  best explains both the current market action  and also the week ahead 

This concept  along with our market indicators  helped in achieving my   The actual forecast was important  The underlying reasoning and method even more so 
As usual  I ll have more about the new worries in my Final Thought

Best Advice for the Week Ahead
The right move often depends on your time horizon  Are you a trader or an investor 
Insight for Traders
We consider both our models and the top sources we follow 
Felix  Holmes  and Friends
We continue with a strongly bullish market forecast  All our models are now fully invested  The group meets weekly for a discussion they call the    In each post I include a trading theme  ideas from each of our five technical experts  and some rebuttal from a fundamental analyst  usually me  but sometimes a guest expert   We try to have fun  but there are always fresh ideas  Last week the group contrasted long and short term themes 
Top Trading Advice
Brett Steenbarger is required reading for traders  My favorite this week is his discussion of   You must read the entire post to understand this approach  but we should expect more on this theme  Does this sound familiar 

When traders refer to the difficult trading environment  they often make reference to  choppy  or  noisy  markets  Usually their next sentences lament the  algos  and their impact upon markets  I find these to be expressions of frustration  not constructive formulations of trading challenges  Invariably  those lamenting choppy markets dominated by algos that  manipulate  markets engage in their venting and then go back to trading as they ve always traded and continue to lose money 

 has ideas about to deal with losses   and how not to 
 has an interesting post on the difference between developing skills and our perceptions of success  While it fits the normal trading themes  this has much broader interest 

Insight for Investors
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of Penske Automotive Group  NYSE PAG   Chuck always has great stock ideas  but he often includes a lesson about how to find the best opportunities  This is a great example   well worth studying by DIY investors  His research uses information from the company  like this chart 

This is crucial if you want to understand the profit drivers  but it is only a start  Among many other points  he also includes one of the most important summary charts from his excellent resource   I never invest in a stock without checking it out at F A S T  Graphs  and that helped us to find PAG more than a year ago  

Stock Ideas
 Industrial Sentiment Survey is loaded with great information from big time buy side investors and analysts  Here is a sample   something I found interesting 

 has some interesting ideas this week  Big banks  Sarepta  NASDAQ SRPT   and O Reilly  NASDAQ ORLY  all get strong mentions  There is also a nice feature on Bespoke Investment after ten years  It includes some of their picks and pans   interesting lists 
 some  battle tested  REITs 
 uses an interesting approach   hedging by market makers doing big volume trades  These actions reflect their expectations about risk and reward  He reports the results on the Dow stocks 

The entire article will help your interpretation  but Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   and United Health Care  NYSE UNH  are the most attractive 
Our  always has some fresh ideas  There are ideas from five different approaches  This week Felix emphasizes energy while Holmes likes Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  
Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  this is a must read  Even the more casual long term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  As usual  investors will find value in several of them  but my favorite is the analysis of annuities   is how a variable annuity works  without the regular sales pitch    is how to create one yourself 
I have emphasized the regular personal finance feature at Abnormal Returns  but the offerings have become much more diverse  I follow them all  often finding items of personal interest as well as ideas for WTWA  If you have not recently checked out the site  it is time for another look  You can also get special benefits by  
Seeking Alpha Editor Gil Weinreich s series for investment advisors is useful for individual investors as well  The well chosen topics span important questions and provide helpful links  I loved   Here is a key quote 

Sadly  many people who reach  retirement   I confess  I do not like that word  experience depression because they don t know what to do with themselves  My two cents  Whatever your ideal vision of retirement may be  start enjoying it now to ensure that you will enjoy it even more then 

How true  In my research this week  I learned that the average daily use of mobile devices for Americans is   Make your guess and see the answer at the end of the post  Also  Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   that members have spent 500 million hours watching Adam Sandler movies 
Market Outlook
 has an excellent discussion of reflation   a key market theme  The term is frequently used  but many do not understand it 

Reflation is the process of getting economic growth and price broadly back to pre recession levels  While progress has been made  growth is still not accelerating  First quarter real gross domestic product  GDP  is forecasted to come in around a 1  annualized level according to Bloomberg  Add in disappointment with the political developments the hoped for stimulus coming from Washington is at least delayed  the Federal Reserve is talking about reducing its balance sheet  and geopolitical tensions are rising and you have a good mix for investors to pare back some risk  Stocks have trended modestly downward  while more cyclical areas of the stock market have struggled at the expense of more defensive areas  We ve also seen yields reverse course after surging on hoped for fiscal stimulus and rising economic growth 

Their overall conclusions are constructive  They address many key concerns   examining and charting the data

Final Thoughts
What should we think about today s key questions 
Government shutdown  I expect this to be avoided  The ideal solution would be an element of bipartisan compromise  The danger  Too many  extras  tacked on 
French election  I have no special insight into the outcome    says it is way too close to call   By the time you read this  we may have the result for this round  One safe prediction is that this story  whatever the initial outcome  will be with us for a couple of months as the runoff occurs  followed by legislative elections  There are plenty of stories with dire predictions  Historically  the press  especially the financial press  has dramatically over estimated these effects  We shall see   Some   
Trump agenda  There has been a challenging learning curve in the first 100 days  For those who think the post election rally was all about Trump  this is a problem  For those of us who expected this rebound  regardless of the election outcome  market friendly policy changes remain as potential upside   has a nice  chart packed analysis of the market s  false narratives   He has a great analysis of the  Trump stocks  and themes 
Market valuations  The table pounding continues  I have written on this topic in detail  including analyses of all the  favorite  valuation indicators   none of which are currently used by the inventors   Skin in the game  is usually an important test for market cynics  Why do they think that others  like Paul Tudor Jones  can interpret the Buffett indicator better than Mr  B  Check out his reasoning  in his Dow 100K comment 
I am going to attempt a simple and brief explanation of the current valuation issue  It involves a  thought experiment  like Einstein s in developing the Theory of Relativity   I love and recommend   
Suppose you are given the chance to purchase an asset for  100 000 with an annual payment of  10 800  a rate of 10 80   Your personal rate of inflation is 13 5  
Suppose instead that you are given the chance to purchase an asset for  100 000 with an annual payment of  2224  a rate of 2 24   Your personal rate of inflation is 1 8  
Which is the better buy  Which should cost more  When inflation is high  both assets look cheap  When it is low  both look dear  BTW  the examples use actual data from 1980 and 2017 
If you understand this example  you see why prospective inflation and interest rates are important for valuing both stocks and bonds  Sources that discusses stock valuation  using only historical data  are telling only part of the story  Ignore them 
Valuation for all assets is relative  If Einstein were with us  he would agree with Mr  Buffett

33402,254917,ORLY,5 Stocks That May Still Jump 25  On A Trump Tax Cut,opinion,"Trump Tax Reform
Stocks are at all time highs three months following President Trump s November victory as the nation s 45th President continues to peddle tax reform and infrastructure spending  A  phenomenal  tax plan is expected to be released in the coming days while many analysts continue to believe it will include a proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35  to 15  
As soon as Trump took office  Wall Street strategists started  with high effective tax rates seeing that they would benefit most from a tax cut  Not surprisingly  many companies have seen their share prices reach new highs including Goldman Sachs  recommendations  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   Quest Diagnostics  NYSE NYSE DGX  and Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  
But are there any stocks that still appear fundamentally undervalued if President Trump does indeed follow through on his  phenomenal  tax reform 
5 Stocks That Could Still Jump 25  on a Trump Tax Cut
In order to find stocks that would benefit most from a US corporate tax rate cut  we searched for companies that 
1  Have historically paid an effective tax rate of over 30   and  2  Generate more than 75  of total revenues domestically 
Then using finbox io s google speadsheet add on  will be released in the next few weeks to all finbox io members   we filtered through our discounted cash flow    analyses to find stocks that are still trading below their intrinsic value when the tax rate assumption driving the model is reduced to 15  
Five stocks immediately jumped out  O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY   Republic Services Inc  NYSE RSG   Tractor Supply Company  NASDAQ TSCO   Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC  and Vectren Corporation  NYSE VVC  
Below is a side by side comparison of each company s projected free cash flows when adjusting the tax rate assumption  The left column calculates free cash flows and the resulting fair value when using the company s historical effective tax  The right column does the same but applies a 15  rate  Every other assumption driving the models is held constant Note that the default revenue  EBITDA  capex  etc  projections for each company are Wall Street consensus estimates as of 2 15 17 O Reilly Automotive has nearly 30  upside when the company s tax rate is cut from 37  to 15  
If tax rates were to remain unchanged  Republic Services appears to be 5  overvalued  However  don t be surprised if shares jump over 30  if the corporate tax rate were cut to 15  
At a 37  tax rate  Tractor Supply has a negative 10  margin of safety  This figure jumps all the way to a positive 29  at the lower 15  tax rate 
Norfolk Southern s tax payments get cut by more than half when implementing Trump tax reform  As shown below  this frees billions of dollars for the company that would otherwise go to Uncle Sam 
Vectren benefits the most out of the companies listed here  When applying its effective tax rate  the valuation implies that the stock s 8  overvalued  However  the model calculates 37  upside when applying the lower 15  rate

If we break  250  it s all over  just look at the ascent and the lack of any price action holding it up ",2017-04-09,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/o’reilly-top-200181726,200181726
33424,254939,ORLY,Stocks To Watch  BMRN  FB  MYL  ORLY,opinion,"Today we have an overview of four US stocks 
Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc   NASDAQ BMRN  
This value was able to break the very mature downtrend on March 1st with a closing price above  87 93  and install a new uptrend  The current price high lies at  90 99  the correction zone  green rectangle  is located between  79 63 and  72 96  The price turned around and went deep back into this zone last week  and last Friday it showed a candle in the trend direction  With an entry in the trend direction  one can speculate on a continuation of this trend  A first target would be located at the last price high  the stop should be placed beneath the green correction zone 

Facebook  NASDAQ  FB 
The social media share has been in an uptrend in the superior trend for a long time now  and has formed its ninth correction in the last two weeks  However  embedded within this we can see an additional  very young uptrend  This also came out of its last correction zone and is aiming for the last high at approx   117 59  But since the superior trend is very mature  it might well become very tight above this marker  However  with a close stop  one can speculate on a run up to this marker 

Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  
In the daily chart we see a very young downtrend  As can be seen in the image  our DowHow setup struck extremely early  and we were able to bring in some nice profits already with an entry in the area of  50  Since the trend is still intact  there is definitely still an entry chance below the low from Thursday at  43 65  to speculate on a continuation of the trend  A first target should be located at the last price low at  40 04  But if the price gets to there  then it will be necessary to drag the stop into the plus 

OReilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY 
This value from the transport sector is showing very large swings in part  The last big upward movement led to another still young uptrend with a correction zone between  269 and  259 82  Since the closing price was unable to overcome the last point two at  272 25 the price returned back to this zone  and with the candle from Friday  another signal was generated for the second attempt at a continuation of the trend  With a stop beneath the green correction zone  one can speculate on a trend continuation  Since the superior trends are also going in the same direction  I would work without a target and let possible profits run

33425,254940,ORLY,The Week Ahead  Is The Fed Too Optimistic ,opinion,"The calendar continues in something of an alternating mode  Last week had plenty of important data  this week has little  Instead we get multiple speeches from Fed Presidents and Governors and the release of the last FOMC minutes  Little data plus lots of Fed news is a natural draw for the punditry  This week they will be asking 
Is the Fed too optimistic  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted a week chock full of data with a focus on the market reaction  Would good news finally be treated as good  That was a popular topic throughout the week  from Chair Yellen s speech to Friday s employment report  Before the opening on Friday  pundits were observing that the solid data was sending stocks lower  By day s end the S P 500 had reversed course  despite weakness in oil prices  The answer to last week s question is a very tentative  yes   Doug Short has the full story with an emphasis on April Fool s Day in his excellent weekly chart   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

Doug s update also provides multi year context  See his full post for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
The economic calendar has few important reports  Once again  the Fed participants will be out in force  The minutes from the last FOMC meeting will be released  Chair Yellen joins a panel discussion with three past Fed chairs  It is a paradise for pundits  They can spend the entire week on the Fed  their favorite topic  With the background of last week s news the discussion might have a little more focus  In particular many will be asking 
Is the Fed too optimistic  
Background 
There is a huge divergence in opinion about the economy  The data tell one story  Opinion tells another  Compare these two Gallup surveys 
 show strength on every measure  Under employment is a typical example 

Meanwhile  29  of  rate current conditions as  poor  and 58  think things are getting worse 

Are these opinions too pessimistic 
MRB Partners  notes the unwinding of recession fears and the strength of recent data  They suggest that economic surprises will mean upside for stocks and risk for bonds 
Who will be correct 
Viewpoints 
The basic themes are familiar 
The Fed has painted itself into a box   TM OldProf mixed metaphor   There is no hope 
The Fed has been too optimistic for many years  What is new 
The Fed is over emphasizing markets rather than the economy 
The Fed is not clearly communicating plans 
The Fed is making appropriate changes  based upon the data 
Fed policy really does not matter much  All of the paths are similar 
Nothing matters except oil prices 
Challenge Revisited 
Your conclusion about how stocks will react is a function of what you believe is driving current market action  We do not get paid for knowing yesterday s news  but it is important to understand the sources of market reaction 
Last week I suggested a challenge for the week ahead  Would commentators turn to  window dressing  as an explanation for any strength  Friday provided an even better test  In the morning  after all of the key data had been released  pundits observed that  good news was bad   By the end of the day both the story and the explanations had changed 
The question now is whether Friday s trading signaled a change in market tone   a willingness to take positive news at face value 
As always  I have my own opinion in the conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was good news in a big week for data 
Chair Yellen tilted in a more dovish direction  an apparent change from recent commentary   has key quotes from the speech and a nice explanation  And  is the speech for your own review 
High frequency indicators are stronger  suggesting the end of the  shallow manufacturing recession    weekly must read update of indicators has the whole story 
ISM manufacturing turned positive and also beat expectations 
Consumer confidence increased to 96 2  beating expectations   and this chart 

Pending home sales rose 3 5    has the story 
Employment gains of 215 000 were solid  as was the ADP private payroll increase of 200K  With the household survey confirming  labor participation higher  full time employment versus part time improving  and wages increasing  it was difficult to find something to complain about  The WSJ has the story in fourteen charts  including this one 

The Bad
Some of the news was negative 
Consumer spending disappointed with revisions and small gains   what this means for Q1 GDP 
Auto sales disappointed   a SAAR of 16 45 versus expectations of 17 6   the ten year high in Ford  NYSE F  sales  not enough to please the market 

Construction spending missed expectations with a loss of 0 5   It is a volatile series  Steven Hansen takes a  
The oil equity correlation continues   

The Ugly 
Infrastructure is deteriorating due to lax maintenance since the financial crisis  The latest example concerns   winning by a nose over Chicago public schools and colleges  

The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes to  for his work on the economic effects of lower oil prices  This is an important subject for both traders and investors  Nearly everyone expected a stimulus from lower prices  the opposite of the  tax  from prior years  When the result did not develop  it launched a massive and misguided search for explanations  which I described  
Taking on each specific argument is a challenge  Prof  Duy does a great job of analyzing and explaining a complicated subject  His series of charts makes the argument accessible for a general audience  He highlights some of my regular complaints in this comment and charts from the original source and his own expansion 

This problem  however  just scratches the surface  Look at either of the first two charts above and two red flags should leap off the screen  The first is the different scales  often used to overemphasize the strength of a correlation  The second is the short time span  often used to disguise the lack of any real long term relationship  I hope I remember these two points the next time I am inclined to post such a chart  


Consider a time span that encompassed the entirety of the 5 year  5 year forward inflation expectations 



Well done 
Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  Beginning last week I made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the 10 Year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of   whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am now using our new model   Holmes   Holmes is a friendly watchdog in the same tradition as Oscar and Felix  but with a stronger emphasis on asset protection  We have found that the overall market indication is very helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
The new approach improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high  This is not market timing as we normally think of it  It is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short

Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read  it would be Morgan Housel s latest post on more     It is a great list   all worth reading  I especially like this one 

Pessimism always sounds smarter than optimism  That s because pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you  while optimism sounds like a sales pitch   even if it s usually right 

And also this 

If we could go back seven years and tell everyone that the Dow is near 18 000  unemployment is 4 9  and gas is  1 90 a gallon  they would think we won the lottery and were drowning in prosperity  Instead  we re complaining about market volatility 

I was actually pretty close to that time frame with my   Everyone did indeed think I was crazy to suggest anything positive  like unemployment getting below 8   Most people have been unable to stay the course through the ensuing rally

Fundamental trends drive whether the news will be better or worse than many anticipate  This is why following economic fundamentals which trend at a relative  snails pace  lets long term investors anticipate whether the  news  is going to be better or worse than that anticipated by Momentum Investors  Using economic fundamentals is the Value Investor approach  I anticipate higher market prices because pessimism continues to dominate the news even in the face of decent economic growth

Final Thoughts 
What should we make of Yellen s apparent shift 
Ed Yardeni says   Thanks Again  Fairy Godmother   He concludes that she  and dovish colleagues  have less confidence in the economy 
Tim Duy writes that she has decided to    by avoiding deflation at all costs 
t that the next recession may be five or six years away due to the protracted economic cycle  He writes as follows 

 recessions usually happen around five years after the Fed s stance on interest rates changes from easing to tightening  Normally  the Fed begins tightening two to three years after a recovery begins  But the depth and longevity of the Great Recession and the slow momentum of the current 65 month recovery kept the Fed from raising interest rates until December of 2015 

Here is what I make of this 
The current debate over the Fed and the economy could go on for years  not just a few months 
Many  including politicians of all stripes and parties  gain by emphasizing the negative  It is not just the election  although that provides a focus  News media collaborate 
The early stages of Fed policy shifts mean little to stock values  despite some knee jerk reactions 
The Fed will eventually succeed in stimulating inflation  It always does 
The eventual reaction to growing inflation will be too late because of the long lags in monetary policy effects 
These conclusions are all sharply contrarian 
We will eventually enjoy stronger growth and higher wages  closing the gap between perception and reality  It will happen before the next recession and is therefore actionable now ",2016-04-03,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-is-the-fed-too-optimistic-200123710,200123710

The increased authorization came into effect from May 27  2016 and is valid for a period of three years  O Reilly will repurchase the shares from the open market  However  the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on various factors including market conditions and share price 
The hike in share repurchase authorization reflects O Reilly s strong liquidity position  The company had cash and cash equivalents of  716 million as of Mar 31  2016  compared with  473 6 million as of Mar 31  2015  In the first quarter of 2016  net cash flow from operations increased to  488 2 million from  406 million in the prior year period

33427,254942,ORLY,7 Stocks To Buy With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to  Buy  or  Sell  a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision  A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged through coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  The focus of this article is on Interest Coverage which is one such ratio Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is very important for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Formula  Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense  Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations  and could default in repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside

33448,254963,ORLY,Why Worry About A Stock Market Bubble,opinion,"The prospects of an especially severe stock market decline are far greater than widely perceived  There is a strong possibility of the most severe decline in over a century transpiring  In fact  a decline on the magnitude of the bear market in stocks after the 1929 peak  where the market lost over three fourths of its value and decimated the savings of many investors  is within the realm of possibility  Such a claim isn t emotional fear mongering  Nor is it based on an end of the world type scenario  Instead  there is a very logical case that can be made for why investors should be especially defensive right now  and seriously question the oft repeated buy and hold advice from pundits that is so prevalent around stock market tops 
Stock Market Bubbles
The word bubble gets thrown around a lot  It s often used imprecisely  For example  in 2000 there was not a bubble in the general stock market  which peak to trough  would lose about half of its value  But there was a bubble in tech stocks  where the Nasdaq would lose over three fourths of its value  Presently  there is not a bubble in the majority of foreign or even U S  stocks  However  it is important to point out that doesn t make them immune to big losses  along the lines of how the S P 500 lost about half its value in the last two bear markets  Stock diversification delivers little protection from the ravages of a big stock market decline  since stocks tend to be correlated to one another  In fact  many stocks are already in a bear market  with over 20 percent declines 
Yet  when bubbles pop they tend more towards the three quarters type losses  And there likely is a bubble in the majority of investor money allocated to U S  stocks  That s because money isn t allocated evenly to stocks  The biggest and best performing stocks get more investor money  And this is where current risk is concentrated in the U S  stock market  This is unlike the last bear market  where risk was concentrated around subprime real estate related investments and before that around technology stocks  And if today s frothy stocks decline in bubble fashion  they will take the capitalization weighted S P 500 index  related index and ETF products  and very many actively managed or passively indexed investor portfolios  down to depths most folks can t fathom 
The New Can t Miss Investments
FANG  NOSH  FANTAsy  and other acronyms have been created for the very small handful of very large stocks representing a big share of both stock market gains and the capitalization weighted stock market  Facebook  O FB   Amazon  O AMZN   Netflix  O NFLX   Alphabet or Google  O GOOGL   Nike  N NKE   O Reilly  O ORLY   Starbucks  O SBUX  and Home Depot  N HD   Priceline  O PCLN   eBay  O EBAY   Microsoft  O MSFT   Salesforce  N CRM   Tesla  O TSLA   and before its recent fall from grace Apple  O AAPL   are all stocks on the short list of performance leaders  Even investors who don t own these stocks directly often own them indirectly in the form of actively managed investment products  exchange traded funds and index funds that are typically capitalization weighted 
We ve seen this story before  where a handful of stocks dominate the market and lead it higher  as their valuations become increasingly irrational  In the tech bubble of 2000  the 100 largest Nasdaq stocks led the market higher and then led the move down  The 1973  1974 bear market saw the broad market lose about half its value after a relatively short list of stocks the so called Nifty Fifty that were a sure thing of America s best companies  turned out to not be such a sure thing  Some of the Nifty Fifty would fall substantially more than fifty percent  despite being considered the highest quality stocks of their times  But the lesson of can t miss investments in the stock market is that ultimately valuations matter  and no investment is can t miss  no matter how good the company 
Borrowing Against the Future
This has been a subpar economic recovery  with poor workforce participation  household income and productivity growth  But the stock market has soared  and that s a problem  Asset prices becoming delinked from their fundamentals is a core characteristic of a bubble that makes that asset prone to massive declines  when financial reality reasserts itself  Two big drivers of stock market performance in the absence of strong economic growth driving sales and operating profits higher  have been the aforementioned trend of a few giant  high flying stocks pulling the entire cap weighted market performance higher  largely via margin expansion  and also the trend among a broader universe of U S  stocks of financial engineering 
A key aspect of financial engineering that has driven the stock market higher is the borrowing of money by companies to buyback their own shares  This process can create earnings growth where no sales growth exists  Simply by reducing the share count  a company increases its earnings per share  EPS   But there is no free lunch and corporate debt levels for many publically traded U S  companies are at the highest levels ever and there has been a significant deterioration in corporate balance sheets  On the other hand  stocks with the heaviest buyback activities have outperformed the rest of the market  With recent troubles in credit markets  impacting borrowing costs  this trend is showing signs of having peaked  And a stock that has driven its EPS and price higher primarily by borrowing money is a strong candidate for being a bubble stock 
A Long Way Down
Financial engineering has done more than increase corporate debt  Wage suppression  cost controls and other measures drove up corporate profitability to a greater than normal share of the U S  economy  But over time corporate profits are mean reverting  Over time the stock market tends to grow with  rather than in excess of the economy  Over the long sweep of history  economic growth in developed economies evens out 
Methods for valuing the stock market that are actually predictive of its future performance tend to function based on these variables  whether it is the Q Ratio  measures the total value of the stock market divided by the replacement value of its companies   a simple reversion calculation to a long term stock market trend line  or a methodology  like the Shiller PE or CAPE  divides the price of companies in the stock market by inflation adjusted earnings for the last 10 years   or other related mean reverting methodologies based on inputs like forward operating earnings  profit margins  dividends or revenue 
What these metrics show in aggregate is that the current stock market peak is in the neighborhood of the 1929 peak  but below the 2000 peak  Getting back to a fairly valued stock market implies a decline of about half  But  although it wasn t the case after the 2000 or the 2007 tops  declines historically often overshoot fair value  A decline in the S P 500 of true bubble bursting proportions and well over half  is very possible based on both history and current conditions  including the current risks around market liquidity evaporating in a big down move 
Furthermore  central bankers have proven that debt can drive economic growth and stock market returns  however unsustainable such returns turn out  But at this point what is there left to inflate  There may not be any better sign of the current debt cycle coming to an end  than the negative interest rates popping up around the globe  This time there is unlikely to be a debt binge around residential real estate in the developed world or more recently around real estate and infrastructure in China  to pull things out 
The Other Side of the Coin
You would think we might have learned our lesson about trying to borrow our way to prosperity from the subprime crisis that led to the previous bear market  Of course areas where that subprime real estate debt were concentrated  suffered enormous losses  Now  we ve got more debt on corporate balance sheets of S P 500 companies  as well as over a trillion in auto loan and also student loan debt that looks increasingly risky 
And that s not even touching on the mountain of debt in China  where economic troubles have rippled into commodity dependent emerging markets and are now being felt in a debt sensitive U S  energy sector that was responsible for many of the few good paying jobs created in this recovery  It s much easier to imagine a scenario  where central banks are not able to significantly support the economy by encouraging more debt formation  than one where they are able  if the U S  consumer falters 
Then again  there are no certainties in the stock market  and maybe the consumer weathers the current storm  despite the present earnings and manufacturing recessions  But valuation and macro economic concerns  have been enough for my firm to reduce equity allocations  Furthermore  signs of debt stress in credit markets were enough for us to still further lower stock allocations  prior to the current downtrend 
Technically  the current stock market looks awfully similar to the last market top and technical weakness has triggered risk measures in many existing positions  still further lowering our stock exposure  In terms of the stocks we ve picked for portfolios  we ve focused on what we consider truly quality stocks  Yet  it s not uncommon for our investors to presently have less than ten percent overall stock exposure in an actively managed account 
Now  all that could change if conditions change  We evaluate risks and opportunities  but we don t try to predict markets  We simply react to key and ever changing indicators  But a lot of things would need to improve for us to meaningfully increase our risk profile around stocks  Right now there is simply too much in the way of risks around a once in a lifetime  immense stock market loss  for it to make any sense to have sizeable U S  stock market exposure for a long term investor 
Getting defensive here is the easier decision  Figuring out when to increase stock exposure again  as well as in the event of a decline  how low is low enough to buy  is likely to be the bigger investment challenge  Then there is the other side of the coin  If the worst happens  it will create the kind of once in a lifetime buying opportunity that delivers substantial outperformance for those who successfully navigate some very choppy market waters ",2016-02-09,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-worry-about-a-stock-market-bubble-383747,383747

Commentary
From the headlines and tweets I am seeing  the market narrative has fully accepted that momentum stocks have died  or are dying  depending on your perspective   Friday  April 4  2014 was a replay of the carnage seen when 50DMAs were getting sliced like so much butter  Now 200DMAs are getting violated on many momentum stocks  200DMA breakdowns signal the potential end of uptrends  not just short term pullbacks 
It is interesting to see how the narrative shifts to fit the market mood  When momentum names were unstoppable  the narrative molded to the action and rationalized that investors are paying up for strong growth  Since nothing fundamental has changed to explain the sudden plunges  the narrative remolds to fit what is happening  suddenly  investors and traders no longer want to pay up  A Reuters article titled    is a classic example of this process of molding narratives to follow the market action  what I also charitably call technical analysis disguised as fundamental analysis   
The first paragraph plunges right into the supposed explanation 

 After their worst week in several years  high flying stocks that defied gravity throughout 2013 look like they re in for more punishment  The reason  Despite the plunge  they still look overvalued  

In a later section called  Oversupply   we are told   Since stocks like Netflix carry valuations far above most of the market  some investors are reluctant to buy them now  
These claims of course beg the question  if these stocks are still overvalued after this sell off  and given the stock prices are lower than when investors were eagerly buying  why were investors buying them in the first place  The article gives no direct answer  but the implicit explanation comes from the quotes of several analysts  Basically  these stocks are falling out of favor because  well  because they are falling 
From Mike O Rourke  chief market strategist at JonesTrading   There s value somewhere  but since these things aren t being traded off typical valuations  you can t go by those metrics  and it s more about when do you find that stability  
From Kim Forrest  senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group   For momentum stocks to work  you need people to believe they can go higher  
The ultimate irony is that Friday s big sell off came on a day when the U S  government released jobs numbers that were just as good  or bad depending on your perspective  as so many others before it 

 The declines have come at a time when investors overall are seeing a general improvement in economic figures  including Friday s nonfarm payrolls data  which showed strong job gains in March and more people moving into the labor force  

Given this backdrop  paying attention to the technicals becomes more valuable than ever  From the time I started  in mid March  the technicals have told us everything we need to know about the market s willingness to change the narrative 
The next irony will come as the market finally accepts concludes that momentum stocks are dead  Next will come a realization that perhaps the market has topped  That moment should finally deliver an oversold period in the stock market that will create one of the better buying opportunities we have seen since the market was last oversold in June  2013 
It has been 189 trading days since the the market was last oversold  T2108 below 20    The projected performance for the S P 500  SPY  after the end of a 198 day 20  overperiod is 9 10   To date  the S P 500 is up 18 6  for the current 20  overperiod  A 10  gain from the last oversold day on June 24  2013 puts the S P 500 at 1730 3  A drop from the current level of 1865 to that point would deliver a 7 2  correction   close enough  to the long anticipated 10  correction  I have generated these numbers to provide rough parameters for a more extended sell off  Note well that I will not be surprised if the market churns for months to come before this top gets an exclamation point 

S P 500 Performance By T2108 Duration Above the 20  Threshold
While I suspect a more extended sell off is finally on its way  the confirming signals that I have monitored have still not all converged to sing with one voice  Here is a quick review of the holdouts with charts following the list  Each one finally showed important signs of weakness on Friday 
The Australian dollar  FXA  remains strong  However  the commodity driven currency faded hard against the Japanese yen  FXY  on Friday  Further selling will finally deliver a confirming signal 
Emerging markets as represent by iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  faded just like AUD JPY  When it gapped up on Friday  I thought it was providing non confirmation of Friday s risk based selling  Now  follow through selling will finally deliver a confirming signal of bearishness  The strength in emerging markets has been one of the most bewildering non confirmations  I like a trading strategy here that uses call and put options as EEM is likely to sprint far and fast in whatever direction it is heading under these increasingly volatile conditions  EEM is already up 7 1  in the current 2 week sprint 
Home builders as represented by iShares US Home Construction  ITB  were early in the current sell off  I found it hard to be bearish on the market when home builders were trading strongly  When I finally conceded that their strength had ended  my mind was much freer to see the other bearish developments unfolding in the market  In the last week  home builders experienced a nice relief rally  They even rallied briefly on Friday only to reverse and close near flat on the day  Like AUD JPY and EEM  further selling from here will provide a confirming signal for the bears 

The Australian dollar finally showed some weakness against the Japanese yen

Until Friday  emerging markets behaved oblivious to the on going carnage in risk related equities

Home builders enjoyed a nice relief rally that may have finally ended on Friday
One final holdout is the volatility index  the VIX  The VIX sprinted higher from multi month lows on Friday  but it remains firmly encased within two months of churn  I do not get excited about the VIX until it closes above the 15 35 pivot  Note that recent history has demonstrated that such a move will be the beginning of the end of a VIX rally  Hopefully this time around  it will be part of a drive to oversold levels 

The VIX has not yet confirmed the current unfolding bearishness
The S P 500  SPY  flipped the script on my mid March call of a top for a few precious days  However  Friday s new all time high leading to a subsequent sell off below that mid March high all but confirms a top is in 

The S P 500 fades hard from a fresh intraday all time high
The even larger drop from the sky on the NASDAQ  NASDAQ QQQ  provides even more convincing evidence that upward momentum has come to an end 

The NASDAQ continues to lead the market downward as momentum wanes
This sell off continues to create some fascinating and very trade able charts  I wish I could post every single one that has caught my attention  I will let the pictures speak for themselves in this small sample  Hopefully some of you have been able to catch some of the most spectacular of the trades I have followed in recent weeks 
When looking at any of these charts  pay careful attention to the following mileposts  behavior around the 50 and 200DMAs  position relative to the last earnings cycle  most momentum stocks have completely reversed those last set of monster gains   dominant trends  position relative to Bollinger Bands   BB   trading well beyond them is unsustainable in the short term but confirms the  ferocity  of an existing trend   and the filling of important gaps  In some cases  tests and retests are trade able for a short term bounce although waiting for confirmation is the more standard trade 

Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  is headed to a very critical retest of converging signals

Google  O GOOGL   GOOG O  has followed through on its bearish failure at its 50DMA resistance

Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  still clings valiantly to its momentum status

Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  has experienced a lively revival  But even ISRG could not maintain the trade above the upper BB past three days  a typical swing trade duration 

LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  is one of the longest standing sell offs among the momentum class  So Friday s accelerated exit COULD transform into a type of crescendo bottom 

Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  seems destined to test its post IPO lows  Its insane run up in December  2013 is a distant memory  But if TWTR follows through on its potential and promise  this sell off could be a unique buying opportunity 

iPath DJ UBS Coffee TR Sub Idx ETN  JO  survived an important test of its major breakout

Splunk Inc  SPLK O  remains the poster child of the collapse in momentum

A very critical test of post IPO lows Rocket Fuel Inc   FUEL O    someone turn on the jets 

Look closely and you can see Pandora Media Inc  NYSE P  printing a head and shoulders top as its breakout ends again

Yelp Inc  NYSE YELP  nicks its 200DMA support for the first time in a year

If momentum continues failing O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  SHOULD fill its latest earnings gap up  But 

 ORLY is one momentum stock that is simply untouchable  If only our portfolios were full of automatic  long term winners like this one

33452,254967,ORLY,3 Retail Stocks To Continue Their Winning Streak in 2015,opinion,"The U S  economy is ready in 2015 after an eventful journey last year that started with a severe winter locking consumers indoors and a loss of steam in the market  Then the economy started to rebound and the Federal Reserve hinted at a recovery by winding up its stimulus program which was initiated to boost economic growth and keep interest rates low 
The economy now looks to have enough steam to carry the momentum  in spite of a slowdown in China  turmoil in Russia  sluggishness in Japan and a struggling Europe  The confidence in an uphill ride amid a shaky international front came mostly from the third and final data for real gross domestic product  GDP  that unveiled the fastest rate of economic growth since the third quarter of 2003  giving the market sufficient impetus 
The economy registered growth of 5  during the third quarter of 2014  according to the  advance estimate  by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  The rate fared better than the second and first projections of 3 9  and 3 5  increases  respectively  Higher business investment and export along with improved consumer spending laid the foundation for a strong GDP 
Gradual recovery in the housing market  a strengthening manufacturing sector  an improving labor market and falling gasoline prices also favored the economy  and boosted consumers  disposable income  Consequently  the economy returned to the growth trajectory in the second quarter  when it increased 4 6   after falling 2 1  in the first quarter due to inclement weather  Market experts believe that improvement in global economy hinges upon the U S   which is expected to grow at a pace of over 3  in 2015 
Low oil prices and rising wages are good for U S  consumers  And with consumer confidence   a key determinant of financial health   reaching its recent heights  the future looks bright for the economy  The data released by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters showed that the consumer sentiment index buoyed up to 93 6 in December from the November reading of 88 8  and was at its highest since Jan 2007  According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index increased to 92 6 in December from 91 0 in November 
321 000 jobs were created in November  and the unemployment rate is lingering around 5 8   its lowest level in six years  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  The impressive jobs report confirms that the U S  economy s fundamentals are strong enough to sustain the momentum  And we expect this positive sentiment to encourage consumer spending  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity  The Commerce Department revealed that consumer spending increased 3 2  in the third quarter from the initial estimate of 2 2  
With bullishness widespread  the Federal Reserve is now contemplating raising interest rates  Analysts  however  still believe that the Fed will not be in any rush to increase the near zero rates for fear of hitting the brakes on the pace of economic recovery  Industry analysts see the encouraging economic data finding reflection in interest rates sometime in mid 2015 but keep their fingers crossed over the market reaction to the move  Last year  the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 8 4  and the S P 500 advanced 12 4  
With the economy in high gear  we could witness more upbeat numbers in the quarter to be reported  This definitely is the time to enrich your portfolio with a favorably ranked stock powered by the optimism of an earnings beat  This increases your chance of getting higher returns

 The Markets 





Stocks ended marginally higher on Tuesday  buoyed by optimism that Greece will reach a deal to satisfy creditors  The Euro continued to firm upon recent gains  attempting to chart a short term double bottom pattern around 1 125  The currency rebounding from some of the most oversold levels in its over 16 year history  Short term resistance around the 20 day moving average is presently being tested  significant resistance around the 50 day moving average  currently at 1 182  continues to suggest an upper limit to any potential rebound rally  Seasonally  the Euro  in US Dollar terms  typically trades flat in February and March  charting a bottom  on average  following the weak month of January 











The big story of the day was the substantial rise in US Treasury yields following the collapse of prices as investors flee the apparent safe haven trade that has dominated for the past 13 months  We had been writing rather exhaustively over recent weeks about 30 year bond prices hitting long term trendline resistance  a level that has resulted in many intermediate peaks in bond prices  bond prices have typically declined in the 12 month period that followed 
The beneficiary from the bond market sell off during those past instances was the equity market as investors rotated out of the fixed income asset class and into riskier investments  Should the 30 Year T Bond trade back down to trendline support at 135 over the weeks and months ahead  the decline would shed around 16 5  in value  a significant move for a fixed income investment 
Seasonally  treasury prices trade lower between now and the end of April as investors take on more risk in the equity market  the month of March is by far the weakest period of the year for the treasury bond  declining by an average of 1 6   The 30 Year Treasury Bond has declined in March 87  of the time over the past 24 years  a significant frequency for any asset class  Bonds seasonally come back into favor during the summer months when investors tend to be more risk averse 











One of the reasons that investors may rotate away from bonds and into stocks is that the yield on the 10 Year treasury note is approximately equivalent to the S P 500 dividend yield  Since the middle of the last century  treasury yields have exceeded the dividend yield  enticing investors towards the fixed income asset class 
With yields converging  the competitive advantage of treasury bonds has now been eliminated  Investors may now be willing to question which asset class will provide the best return over the long run  A rotation from bonds into stocks would increase the treasury yields and pressure dividend yields lower  once again opening the gap between the two asset classes that has persisted since the late 1950 s 







Sentiment on Tuesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 95

33517,255032,ORLY,Dividends Provide A Return Bonus ,opinion,With all things being equal  dividend paying common stocks provide their shareholders a return bonus  or what some might like to call a kicker  over an equivalent common stock that pays no dividend  Many investors do not see it this way  as they tend to think of the dividend providing them their return  However  the stock market capitalizes earnings whether a company pays a dividend or not  Moreover  we contend that the market will value a given company s earnings based on their past and future prospects for growth  again  regardless of whether a dividend is paid or not To clarify our point further  an investment in a common stock typically offers their shareholders two components of return  The first component is the capital appreciation component or the increase  or decrease  in the stock s value over time  The second component is the dividend  or lack thereof  that the company pays to shareholders in cash  typically once a quarter  The two added together equal the shareholders  total return  On the one side  we have the capital growth component and on the other side the income component Now  here is the primary point behind this article  If you examine two companies with equivalent rates of earnings growth  where one pays a dividend and the other does not  the dividend payer will provide their shareholders a higher total return  In other words  we re suggesting that both stocks will provide equivalent capital appreciation when measured over a time period when the market is behaving rationally  We would define this as a time period when both stocks were being priced at fair value in the beginning and in the end  Consequently  the stock that pays a dividend to its shareholders is providing them a return bonus or kicker What we are about to say next may come as heresy to the devout dividend growth investor  Nevertheless  the facts speak for themselves and we ask that they try to look at the total picture with an open mind  and eyes  In either case  dividend paying or not  the bulk  or majority  of total return will be provided by the capital appreciation component  This is why we are saying that dividends are a kicker or bonus return  In other words  capital appreciation is the cake and dividends  if any  are the icing As a point of further clarification  this principle applies to the true dividend growth stock  We would define a true dividend growth stock as a company that has historically grown earnings at an above average growth rate  and is expected to continue growing earnings at an above average rate in the future  To clarify even further  low growth dividend paying stocks like utilities will often provide their shareholders the bulk of their returns through dividends  This is due to the low growth nature of their earnings which typically leads to subpar capital appreciation A Picture Is Worth 1000 WordsTo illustrate the validity of the thesis behind this article  we are going to once again rely on the F A S T  Graphs  earnings  price  and dividends  correlated research tool  This powerful  tool to think with  was designed to graphically  and therefore  instantaneously portray the important principles underlying the total return that shareholders can expect from a given common stock  More importantly  they were designed so that each of the two components of return  capital appreciation and dividend income  could be visually exposed independently and therefore  returns easily and quickly calculated The Total Return ComponentThe total return component is driven by the market pricing of a company according to its earnings achievements  Therefore  the orange earnings justified valuation line on each of the following graphs represents what we call the True Worth  or what others might call the intrinsic value of each sample company  again  based on the market capitalizing its total earnings  Simply stated  when the black monthly closing price line touches the orange earnings line  fair value is present Focusing on this earnings and price relationship will provide an instantaneous perspective of capital appreciation as long as fair value is present in the beginning and the end  All that the reader has to do is look immediately to the right of each graph to find the company s earnings growth rate listed and use it to easily estimate returns Consequently  without any mathematical computation  the reader should understand that the capital appreciation component will precisely equal  or at least closely correlate  to the company s earnings growth  Therefore  when price starts on the orange line and is on the orange line at the end  whatever the earnings growth rate is  the capital appreciation will also be  within minor valuation adjustments  In order to demonstrate this as clearly as possible  we had to carefully pick historical time frames where earnings and price were correlated  the price touching the orange line  both at the beginning and at the end  Although we could not do this with absolute precision  as you will soon see we were able to accomplish it within reasonable margins of error In other words  the price and earnings relationships we are showing are not perfect matches  but very close  However  in order to carry out this objective with the examples chosen  we had to draw some of our charts where we ended them through calendar year end 2011 because valuation was in alignment at that time  thereby eliminating any 2012 data points   This was done in order to visually articulate the principle that we are hypothesizing The Dividend Income ComponentInterestingly enough  the dividend income component is also driven by and is a function of the company s earnings achievements  Even though dividends are paid out of earnings  we intend to demonstrate that the market eventually capitalizes the full measure of the company s earnings even though a portion has been paid out  Therefore  the dividend component becomes  as our thesis indicates  an extra or bonus piece of return In order to depict this as vividly as possible  we chose to illustrate the full measure of each company s earnings  the green shaded area with the orange line on top  and then illustrate the dividend component separately  Therefore  we calculate the dividends paid out of earnings  light blue shaded area  and show them as additional return by stacking them on top of the green shaded earnings area on the graph  Note  The orange line represents the fair value of the company s earnings  while the green shaded area represents the total earnings   We believe this serves as a constant reminder that even though dividends come out of earnings  the capital appreciation component of the dividend paying stock is not reduced or diminished by the dividend A quick word about ex dividend dates are in order  Although it is true that a company s stock price will fall at precisely the level of its declared dividend  this is only relevant for that brief moment in time  In any other time during the quarter  and usually almost immediately following the ex dividend date  the company s stock price will be once again capitalized based on its total earnings  In other words  over the majority of the time that a dividend paying stock trades  their shareholders  profits are not penalized by dividends  Therefore  and in truth  the dividend provides additional return above and beyond the company s earnings growth Examples Of The Dividend BonusBefore we move on to presenting specific graphical evidence of our thesis that dividends are a bonus  a few qualifying remarks are in order  As previously alluded to  this article focuses on dividend growth stocks  which we define as dividend paying companies with above average earnings growth  Therefore  we will be primarily presenting companies with above average  to significantly above average  historical total returns and earnings growth rates  It is from this class of dividend paying stock where the majority of return comes from growth of principle On the other hand  even for low growth dividend paying stocks such as utilities  the capital appreciation component is often low because of the low growth rate of the company s earnings   If you would like to test this last statement regarding low growth utilities  follow this link to Addendum To  Investing in Central Utility Stocks  Do Today s Valuations Make Sense  Part 3  Furthermore  the dividend component is usually above average with utility stocks  so cumulative total dividend returns may be equal to or even exceed capital appreciation  Nevertheless  the principle that dividends represent a bonus return remains valid Our first set of examples compares two very fast growing businesses with one paying a dividend and the other not  Our nonpaying example is Hibbett Sports Inc  HIBB   a sporting goods store operating predominately in the Southeast  Southwest  Mid Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States  As we can clearly see by the earnings and price correlated graphic below  the company s earnings growth rate  the orange line  has averaged over 19  for the years 1998 to 2011  But most importantly  we see that the market has priced the company in accordance with its earnings growth  Note the lack of a dividend as highlighted at the bottom of the graph  also no light blue shaded area on graph  Our dividend paying example  FactSet Research Systems Inc  FDS   combines integrated financial information  analytical applications  and client service to enhance the workflow and productivity of the global investment community  Their services are offered to Investment Managers  Hedge Funds  Investment Bankers  Wealth Managers  Pension Plans  Private Equity Groups  Government Agencies  Academics and numerous other members of the financial community Just as we saw in our first example  the market has capitalized the full measure of FactSet Research Systems Inc s earnings just as it did for Hibbett Sports Inc  However  our attention is immediately drawn to the light blue shaded area or dividends  Since the company s price was close to the earnings line at the beginning and at the end  we can assume that capital appreciation should approximate the 20  plus earnings growth rate  But the key point behind this article is to note that dividends provide returns that are in addition to price appreciation as depicted by the light blue shaded area Next let s examine the total return performance of each of our two samples  Our first example  Hibbett Sports Inc  grew earnings at 19  and therefore  generated capital appreciation at 18 2  that was a close approximation to its earnings growth rate of 19 3   Note that there are no dividends or dividend cash flow table listed  This is another design feature of the F A S T  Graphs  research tool A  1000 investment made on December 31  1997 would have purchased 230 shares of Hibbett Sports Inc  at  4 35 per share  By December 31  2011 the price of the stock had appreciated approximately ten fold to  45 18 per share  This turned a  1000 investment into  10 391 40 for a compounded annual rate of return of 18 2  per year  which again  was although just under but closely approximating the 19  earnings growth rate  Even without a dividend  Hibbett Sports Inc  generated shareholder returns that were significantly higher than the average company as measured by the S P 500 Now  as we turn to our dividend paying example  FactSet Research Systems Inc   we discover a more complex performance record  We still discover that a  1000 investment on December 31  1997 would have purchased 146 shares at a price of  6 83 per share  Then  just as we saw with our first example  the share price on December 31  2011 grew to  87 28 per share  Thereby generating a capital appreciation component  that is more than twelve fold larger than our original investment Interestingly  our dividend paying  and therefore theoretically more conservative stock  actually grew faster notwithstanding the fact that it was paying dividends  This explains the greater capital appreciation component with FactSet Research Systems Inc  However  we further discover the dividend cash flow table which clearly illustrates the impact  and the additional rate of return  that shareholders received through dividends With our next two examples we will look at a slightly shorter time frame covering the eight year period calendar years 2004 through 2011  Once again  our sample companies in the time frames covered were specifically chosen because they clearly illustrate the reality behind our thesis that dividends represent a bonus return to shareholders  To repeat  if you have two companies with approximately the same rate of earnings growth that are purchased at fair value  and one pays a dividend  its shareholders will receive a bonus return over shareholders of the non dividend paying or otherwise equivalent company O Reilly Automotive Inc  ORLY  is a fast growth automotive aftermarket parts and tools retailer that grew earnings at a rate of 19 5  per annum between 2004 in 2011  Clearly  we see that the company s stock price has tracked its earnings growth  and anytime when the price moved above or below the earnings line it quickly returned  However  the important point is that the market capitalized the full measure of the company s earnings in the long run Consequently  shareholders of O Reilly Automotive Inc enjoyed a return over this eight year period of time that was virtually identical to the company s earnings growth rate  But since there were no dividends being paid  only the capital appreciation component applies Our next example  McDonald s Corp  MCD   also enjoyed very fast earnings growth of 17 7  from 2004 to 2011  However  we see by the light blue shaded area on its graph that they also paid their shareholders a nice dividend  With this graph we can clearly see a visual example of how dividends represent an extra  or bonus  rate of return  The stock price very closely tracks and correlates to earnings with the price close to touching the orange line at the beginning and only slightly above the orange line at the end  Therefore  once again we see undeniable evidence that the full measure of McDonald s earnings are being priced by the marketplace  If dividends do not represent additional return  then it would logically follow that the normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  would be below the orange earnings line illustrating that the market did not price the portion of earnings that were paid in dividends  Instead  we see that both the orange earnings justified valuation line and the blue normal PE ratio line are almost perfectly coinciding Now as we examine McDonald s performance  we find capital appreciation slightly exceeding earnings growth due to the very modest overvaluation at the end of the period  However  and most importantly  we see that dividends in this example contribute additional return Just like we saw with O Reilly Automotive above  McDonald s shareholders received the full value of their earnings growth from the marketplace  Furthermore  their dividend payments representing a portion of earnings paid out to shareholders  did not penalize the capital appreciation component of the stock  Instead  dividends made a meaningful and additional contribution to McDonald s Corp s exceptional total shareholder returns during this time period SummaryTake away all the day to day noise associated with investing in stocks and the stock market and you will discover that in the long run fundamentals matter  In other words  inevitably shareholders of stock in a publicly traded company will be rewarded in direct proportion to how well the business performs on an operating basis  The better the business does  the better the shareholders will be rewarded The primary measurement of business performance is profitability  otherwise known as earnings  It is earnings that the market ultimately prices a stock by  and it is from earnings that dividends are paid  However  it is our contention that the market does not price the stock according to their dividend policy  they price the stock according to their earnings power  Therefore  if and when a company does pay a dividend  it represents a nice bonus to total shareholder returns When we review the earnings and price correlated graph on Hormel Foods Corp  HRL  below we see that the black monthly closing stock price line tracks the orange earnings justified valuation line  Furthermore  we also see that  in fact  the market has tended to more often than not applied a premium valuation to this moderate growing blue chip  With this iteration  dividends have been excluded from the analysis With our next graphic we simply redraw the graph with dividends  the light blue shaded area  added  Remember  our first graph and this graph show the market applying a premium valuation  However  the difference here is that we see how dividends  when they are stacked on top of earnings  represent the additional return dividends provide the shareholders  As you look at this graph and the other dividend paying stocks included in this article  you should keep in the back of your mind that the light blue shaded area actually represents a cash payment to shareholders Now as you examine the performance associated with the earnings and price correlated graph above  note that capital appreciation  closing annualized ROR  is almost identical to the company s earnings growth rate  Therefore  all of the company s earnings are being priced by the market  even those earnings that were paid out in dividends  However  we can also clearly see how the dividends represent the bonus this article has presented within its thesis ConclusionsWe have long held that investing in common stocks is all about investing in the underlying businesses  When looked at this way  it is only logical to place more of your focus and attention on the results of the companies you are invested in instead of worrying about day to day variations in its market price  Because  whether it is capital appreciation you are after  dividend income or both  they are all generated by the profits from the businesses Regarding dividend paying stocks  it s great to get  as Will Rogers so eloquently once put it  a return of your capital as well as a return on your capital  The major object of this article was to point out that dividend paying stocks are capable of providing both a return of original capital invested and a return on your money  On the other hand  dividend paying stocks are fully capable of being great total return generators  From this perspective  we see the dividend as a nice quarterly bonus  But whether dividend paying or not  the principles of valuation must always be given careful consideration
