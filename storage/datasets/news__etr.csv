119640,341155,ETR,What changes to expect from Obama s final Clean Power Plan,news,"By Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Environmental Protection Agency will unveil as soon as Monday the final version of a sweeping   and controversial   regulation to cut carbon emissions from the electricity sector  In its initial version  the Clean Power Plan called for cutting the country s power plant emissions 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030  setting different targets for each state  The proposal is the signature piece of President Barack Obama s climate change policy  White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said this week that the final rule will be  stronger in many ways than the proposed rule    But the Clean Power Plan has been sharply criticized by the energy and manufacturing industries and some energy producing states  and opponents have already vowed to challenge the regulation in court  The final rule is expected to accommodate some of that opposition  as well as take into account feedback from over 4 3 million public comments  Among other things  The EPA is expected to push back the rule s start date by two years to 2022  according to a slide posted by the agency briefly on its website on Tuesday  Here are some things to look for in the final rule  Why will the EPA push the start date back  One of the biggest complaints about the draft proposal was the timetable  Some coal reliant states complained that moving too quickly on building out natural gas pipelines and shutting down coal plants could lead to electricity shortages  And the Edison Electric Institute  a U S  utility lobby group  said the interim goals would make electricity more costly for consumers  Delaying the start date and giving extra credit to states that took early action offers an  easy concession  for the EPA  according to the Resources for the Future think tank  Will the EPA change how states can hit their targets  The EPA set individual goals for each state to reduce the carbon intensity of their power plants based on a mix of four  building blocks   improving efficiency of coal fired power plants  replacing more coal with natural gas  deploying more wind  solar and hydro power and preserving nuclear power  and expanding consumer energy efficiency programs  The agency is expected to revise some of their assumptions about how quickly states can switch out coal for natural gas  while taking into account growing penetration of renewable energy sources   They will be updating information on renewables and efficiency to incorporate data that wasn t included the first time around   said David Doniger  a director at the Natural Resources Defense Council   That really ups what you can get out of those sources    On the other hand  South Carolina  Georgia and Tennessee hope to see less stringent targets in the final rule  Those states have nuclear plants under construction   but not yet operating  The EPA had treated those states as if the plants were already generating power  raising unrealistic expectations for the rate of cuts  those states said   Will the EPA give states clearer ground rules on interstate emissions trading  Many experts expect the EPA to make it easier for power plants to trade emission permits as a way to meet their carbon reduction targets  Allowing states to measure emissions by total tonnage makes it easier for plants to  trade those tons   said Chuck Barlow  head of regulatory affairs at Entergy  NYSE ETR   a power generator based in New Orleans  Barlow said state air regulators already trade sulfur permits this way  He also expects the EPA to facilitate that emissions trading by dropping requirements for them to strike legal agreements   some of which would require legislative approval   between states  Will the EPA prepare a federal plan for states that  say no  to the Clean Power Plan  
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has been urging governors to ignore the EPA rule  though so far only Oklahoma has said it would not comply  The EPA is now expected to reveal a  federal implementation plan  that states would be forced to adopt if they miss a 2016 deadline for submitting plans on how they propose to meet their targets ",2015-07-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/what-changes-to-expect-from-obama's-final-clean-power-plan-353803,353803
119641,341156,ETR,U S  justices question Obama administration electricity markets rule,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    Conservative U S  Supreme Court justices on Wednesday expressed doubt about whether the Obama administration had the authority to issue a regulation aimed at encouraging efficiency in the electricity market by having electrical grid operators pay users to reduce consumption at peak times  The court heard oral arguments in an appeal filed by the U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeking to reverse a May 2014 ruling by the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that threw out the rule   The case pits the government s energy regulator against power companies that are fighting a regulation that promises to cut into their profits   The regulation concerns what FERC calls  demand response   which is when  in an attempt to manage demand for electricity  regional electrical grid operators agree to pay electricity users to cut consumption at peak times  It is aimed at improving grid reliability  lowering costs and encouraging clean energy  The rule remains in effect while the case continues  The nine member court could be divided 4 4  with conservative Justice Samuel Alito recusing himself from the case  An even split would uphold the lower court ruling  Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said he was concerned about the federal government exercising too much authority over retail electricity markets  traditionally overseen by states   You have to have some sort of limiting principle  otherwise FERC can do whatever it wants   Roberts said  Justice Anthony Kennedy  who often casts the deciding vote in close decisions  asked questions indicating he could favor a narrower ruling against the government that would allow FERC to rewrite the regulation rather than ruling that FERC has no authority to issue one  The court s liberal justices were more supportive of FERC   Justice Elena Kagan said it would be an  odd result  if the court does not allow the agency to regulate on the issue because Congress made clear in the 2005 Energy Policy Act that  it wanted FERC to lower barriers to demand response   The Electric Power Supply Association  PPL Corp  N PPL  and other trade groups that challenged the regulation would lose out if the regulation is upheld because it is likely to reduce demand for electricity generation  The Electric Power Supply Association s members include  Exelon Corp   N EXC  and Dynegy Inc  Utility group Edison Electric Institute  which represents such companies as  Entergy Corp   N ETR  and Southern Company  N SO   also challenged the rule  Some utilities and companies that support the regulation backed the government s appeal

119828,341343,ETR,Entergy  ETR  Is Up 3 5  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Entergy  ETR   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Entergy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ETR that show why this power company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ETR  shares are up 3 5  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 1 18  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 61  compares favorably with the industry s 3 61  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Entergy have risen 9 24   and are up 49 75  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 7 78  and 23 85   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ETR s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ETR is averaging 1 045 834 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ETR 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ETR s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 31 to  5 37 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that ETR is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Entergy on your short list ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/entergy-etr-is-up-35-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200502401,200502401

for ECB  Fed Rate CutsMarket expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut the benchmark rate have intensified after the European Central Bank  ECB  announced a cut in its key interest rate to shore up Eurozone s economy The ECB has not only cut interest rate by 10 basis points to a record low of minus 0 5  but will also purchase bonds worth  20 billion every month starting November  With the restart of a quantitative easing program  the ECB has launched its strongest dose of monetary stimulus in more than three years Like the Eurozone economy  the American economy is being weighed down by a global economic slowdown and the ongoing U S  China trade dispute  In fact  there is serious threat to America s longest stretch of economic expansion  presently in the 11th year following the great recession  Thus  the Fed will possibly follow ECB next week   Trade War Dampens Investor ConfidenceMore than a year long tariff dispute between the United States and China has been denting investor confidence  Hiring has slowed down and there has been contraction in the U S  manufacturing sector In August  the United States added 130 000 nonfarm jobs   as reported by the Labor Department   falling short of economists  projection of 150 000 as surveyed by The Wall Street Journal  Moreover  in the past three months  there has been an average addition of 156 000 jobs each month  below the average new job addition of 190 000 since the employment picture started improving eight years ago after the last recession   The Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index slipped to 49 1 in August  Notably  the reading below 50 indicates a contraction in American manufacturing sector for the first time in three years Another Fed Rate Cut Highly PossibleThe slowdown in the job market and the sagging manufacturing sector amid trade tensions are clearly weighing on the U S  economy  To cushion the economy  the Fed is expected to cut the benchmark federal fund rate at its Sep 17 to 18 policy meeting  This will likely be the officials  second rate cut following the first reduction in July since 2008  Reportedly  the market is highly optimistic about a 25 bp rate cut by the Fed Notably  President Donald Trump strongly recommended that the Fed should lower its benchmark rate to zero or below so that the United States can refinance its debt load  In fact  after the ECB launched its new stimulus  Trump built pressure on the Fed to cut rates Rate Sensitive Stocks to Make MerryThe possibility of a Fed rate cut is likely to favor utility firms since their businesses

119937,341452,ETR,Entergy  ETR  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Entergy  ETR  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  39 3  
Revenues are expected to be  3 46 billion  up 11 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 69  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Entergy 
For Entergy  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 04  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Entergy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Entergy would post earnings of  1 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 35  delivering a surprise of  2 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Entergy appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/entergy-etr-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200476851,200476851

What s Next for Entergy

119970,341485,ETR,ETR Vs  WEC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Utility   Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with Entergy  ETR  and WEC Energy Group  WEC   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Entergy has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while WEC Energy Group has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that ETR s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ETR currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 20  while WEC has a forward P E of 24 71  We also note that ETR has a PEG ratio of 2 89  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 4 20 
Another notable valuation metric for ETR is its P B ratio of 2 07  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  WEC has a P B of 2 71 
These metrics  and several others  help ETR earn a Value grade of B  while WEC has been given a Value grade of D 
ETR sticks out from WEC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that ETR is the better option right now ",2019-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/etr-vs-wec-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200450732,200450732

120115,341630,ETR,Entergy  ETR  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Entergy  ETR  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 67 billion  down 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 12  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Entergy 
For Entergy  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 99  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Entergy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Entergy would post earnings of  0 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 60  delivering a surprise of  25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Entergy appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/entergy-etr-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200410249,200410249
120116,341631,ETR,Why Entergy  ETR  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Entergy  ETR   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry 
This power company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 29 11  
For the last reported quarter  Entergy came out with earnings of  0 60 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 48 per share  representing a surprise of 25   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 83 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 77 per share  delivering a surprise of 33 22  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Entergy  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Entergy currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 99   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 1  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

120194,341709,ETR,Analysts Estimate Entergy  ETR  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Entergy  ETR  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  36 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 96 billion  down 25 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Entergy 
For Entergy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 29  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Entergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Entergy would post earnings of  2 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 77  delivering a surprise of  33 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Entergy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-entergy-etr-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200387524,200387524
120229,341744,ETR,ETR Vs  UTL  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Utility   Electric Power sector have probably already heard of Entergy  ETR  and Unitil  UTL   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Entergy has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Unitil has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that ETR has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
ETR currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 37  while UTL has a forward P E of 22 21  We also note that ETR has a PEG ratio of 1 77  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  UTL currently has a PEG ratio of 6 
Another notable valuation metric for ETR is its P B ratio of 1 86  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  UTL has a P B of 2 11 
These metrics  and several others  help ETR earn a Value grade of A  while UTL has been given a Value grade of C 
ETR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ETR is likely the superior value option right now ",2018-11-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/etr-vs-utl-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200360638,200360638

120264,341779,ETR,Dollar Surges To 16 Month High  5 Domestic Picks,opinion,The U S  dollar touched its highest level in nearly one and a half years on Nov 12 as investors anticipated another rate hike in December  Additionally  the pound and euro declined considerably  Concerns surrounding Brexit and Italy s budget were the other major factors boosting the dollar against its major rivals    Meanwhile  a number of indicators show that the U S  economy remains on a firm footing  The dollar s surge and a strong U S  economy would make domestically focused stocks better options than their multinational peers  Adding such stocks to your portfolio makes good sense at this time Rate Hike  Brexit  Italy Budget Fears Drive DollarOn Monday  the ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index gained 0 7  to hit 97 54 at 3 27 p m  ET  Earlier during the day  it had climbed to 97 58  the highest level since Jun 23  2017  The dollar staged a rebound after it declined at the end of the much awaited mid term polls  Investors felt that a divided Congress would reduce chances of further fiscal stimulus measures However  the Fed s latest policy statement indicates that it will continue to raise rates as long as the economic recovery continues  Its current stance has hugely increased chances of a rate hike in December  Per CME Group s  NASDAQ CME  FedWatch tool  there is a 76  chance of the Fed raising rates after next month s meeting Meanwhile  the euro lost 0 8  against the dollar to hit 1 12  its lowest level since June 2017  This was primarily due to growing strife in Europe over Rome s budget proposals for 2019  which failed to receive approval last month  Further  concerns surrounding a no deal Brexit led to the pound losing 0 9  to hit  1 28 Economic Growth  Labor Market Remain StrongU S  GDP increased 3 5  in the third quarter  Notably  consumer spending increased at an annual pace of 4  in the third quarter  This is the sharpest pace of growth in consumer expenditure witnessed in around four years  Economic expansion remains robust and is unlikely to fall below 3  in the fourth quarter   Read   Additionally  while job additions for October widely exceeded expectations  the unemployment rate remained flat at 3 7   the lowest since December 1969  More notably  the year over year increase in wages increased from 2 8  to 3 1   This is the fastest pace of wage increases recorded since early 2009    Read   Our ChoicesWith the Fed set to raise rates in December and worries in Europe unlikely to abate swiftly  the dollar is likely to crawl higher in the days ahead  In such an event  companies which conduct all their business within the United States are likely to be in an advantageous position compared to those with substantial overseas operations Domestically focused companies will gain further since GDP and the domestic job market are likely to remain strong  This is why it may be a good idea to pick such stocks  At the same time  selecting winning stocks is a difficult task This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have

120276,341791,ETR,Is Entergy Corporation A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value 
One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Entergy Corporation   NYSE ETR  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks 
PE Ratio
A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole 
On this front  Entergy Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 8  as you can see in the chart below 

This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 9x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Entergy Corporation s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months 

Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers 

We should also point out that Entergy Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 1  which is much higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term 
P S Ratio
Another key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings 
Right now  Entergy Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years 

Broad Value Outlook
In aggregate  Entergy Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Entergy Corporation a solid choice for value investors 
What About the Stock Overall 
Though Entergy Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C  This gives ETR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  
Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen one up and one down in the same time period 
This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 2 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Entergy Corporation Price and Consensus    
The stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term 
Bottom Line
Entergy Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 24  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below 

So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

120342,341857,ETR,Hurricane Harvey Wreaks Havoc  3 Utilities In Focus,opinion,"In one of the most devastating tropical storms in 50 years    Hurricane Harvey    the city of Houston was the worst hit  The storm ravaged through the city causing widespread damage to properties as well as human lives  Catastrophic flooding further added to the woes 
Among the 16 sectors in our Zacks Coverage Universe  Energy and Insurance sectors have lost the most  In addition  Utility sector also suffered since catastrophic flooding affected transmission lines in many regions of the state  forcing thousands to deal with power cuts 
Harvey s Effect in Texas
According to Texas Governor Greg Abbott  the impact of Harvey was far greater than that of Hurricane Katrina  which affected New Orleans in 2005 
The U S  government requested Congress for an aid of  7 85 billion for rescue operations in Texas and Louisiana  However  Governor Abbott  in his latest interview to BBC News  claimed that Texas will need an assistance of  180 billion to recuperate from the loss  Notably this is higher than his earlier provided estimate of  125 billion worth aid 
Harvey s Impact on Utilities
Per the latest report provided by the Electric Reliablity Council of Texas  ERCOT   as of Sep 1  certain areas in the state of Texas will continue to experience outages due to Harvey  This is because two major 345 kV transmission lines in the state are still out of service  including the one in Houston 
Moreover  about 7 500 MW of generation resource capacity remains unavailable or is operating at reduced capacity 
According to ERCOT s report  none of the major utilities in this area have suffered any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system  thanks to advanced infrastructural development  However  most of their customers suffered significant power outages  which in turn may impact their third quarter bottom line results 
Although  utility providers are trying their best to restore the system  it is difficult to exactly forecast the time of full restoration as it depends on the extent of damage and location of the outage  Moreover  continued flooding is likely to delay restoration in many areas and lead to new outages 
Naturally  electricty flow from utility providers that operate in Texas suffered extensively due to this category 4 hurricane  which had earlier been predicted to be a category 3 storm 
Utilities Hit by Harvey
Considering the fact that Houston is the fourth most populous city of the United States  demand for electricity is also high  Coming to the state s statistics  Texas is the second largest economy among the U S  states and is the largest electricity consumer  as per latest report by the U S  Energy Information Administration  This made the state a well desired abode for utility players to expand their business 
However  Harvey s impact on the state s properties hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines  leading to widespread outages and are expected to affect the growth of the following three utilities 
American Electric Power Company  Inc    NYSE AEP    AEP Texas  a subsidiary of American Electric Power  is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers in west  central and southern Texas  It encompasses the AEP service territory in the ERCOT 
The company s shares have lost 0 8   following the impact of Harvey  It currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

CenterPoint Energy  Inc    NYSE CNP    Houston Electric  a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas Gulf Coast area including the city of Houston  It is also a member of the ERCOT 
The company s shares have lost 1  due to Harvey s impact  It currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  

Entergy Corporation   NYSE ETR    Entergy Texas  a subsidiary of Entergy Corp   engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas 
The company s shares have declined 1  owing to Harvey  It currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 

Bottom Line
Harvey not only destroyed properties in Texas but also left an indelible mark on the lives of many  However  no one can deny the fact that the enormous investments which Utilities have been making in infrastructural developments to upgrade their transmission lines and grid system have paid well during this period of crisis  Thus it can be said that though Harvey had been one of the worst storms to affect America in the recent past  the damages that occurred to the grids and transmission lines were not equally extensive 
However  owing to safety issues distributors snapped electricity in flooded areas resulting in prolonged outages  Though the operating profits of the utility providers are likely to be impacted by the move  the extent of the same would have been much higher had the grid system been affected  Nevertheless  with Hurricane Irma knocking on the doors  utility providers may need to brace themselves from yet another tropical storm and its aftermath

120347,341862,ETR,Oil Prices Still Reacting To Post Hurricane Harvey,opinion,"In Harm s Way 
The strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic is promising catastrophic destruction for everything in its path  Hurricane Irma s impact of financial and commodity markets could be far reaching and we offer prayers for everyone who is harm s way  To add to the oil market worries  we now have Tropical Storm Katia that has formed in the Gulf of Mexico which will impact some Mexican oil production  A much smaller storm and close to land with maximum sustained winds are at 40 MPH  The storm is moving east southeast at 2 miles per hour 
Oil prices are still reacting to the post Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts  Crude oil prices surged as refiners start to come back online and nervous buyers in Asia start to buy up oil supply  Reuters reported that the spread between Brent and WTI is causing some big Asian buying as refinery shut downs in the aftermath of Harvey pushed the spread between West Texas Intermediate crude and Brent crude to the widest in two years at nearly  6 00 a barrel  Yet that spread is coming back as US refiners are trying to come back 
The Department of Energy reports that five refineries are in the process of restarting after being shut down and one refinery has begun operations  Six additional refineries in the Gulf Coast are operating at reduced rate 
The nation s largest refinery  Motiva Enterprises  began restarting partial production as reported by Reuters  Despite lots of flood damage  they were going to restart the large crude distillation unit  hydrocracker and coker at the 603 000 barrel per day Port Arthur  Texas  Motiva spokeswoman Angela Goodwin said in a statement 

We expect the refinery to initially return to approximately 40 percent production by the end of this weekend  provided that the final assessments meet our operational standards 

The restart news cooled RBOB futures yet still has not brought them down dramatically  Now  depending on the track of Hurricane Irma  this could potentially send prices soaring or crashing on gas  depending on where she makes land fall  One track has the storm hitting Florida straight up the middle of the state which would be bearish for prices as we would see demand destruction at a historic level  Couple that with the demand destruction that we have seen in Texas it would have a major downside compact on price 
Of couse another track has us going into Alabama which would again shut down refineries and impact production and we saw from Harvey that would spike gas prices and bring down West Texas Intermediate  WTI   If we move up the East Coast that too would be a demand destruction event and depending on how far inland the storm goes  would determine the extent of the lost demand for barrels 
While the Colonial Pipeline has restarted  Line 2  distillate  between Houston and Lake Charles is shipping gasoline from existing stocks in the Houston area there is still some complaints that they are not being flexible enough to allow the maximum flow of gas and oil  Reuters reported that Valero Energy Corp  NYSE VLO   the largest U S  independent refiner  asked federal regulators to allow or direct Colonial Pipeline Co  to lift gasoline grade requirements in the wake of Hurricane Harvey  Valero said Colonial s move to restrict the grades of gasoline flowing on its system is inconsistent with the intended effect of the U S Environmental Protection Agency s emergency fuel waivers for 38 states and Washington  D C  The intended effect of course is to move supply as quickly as possible to get prices at the pump back down 
Natural gas is feeling demand destruction that may get worse in the aftermath of Irma  The electricity sector is making recoveries after Hurricane Harvey but demand based on cooler forecasts are a negative for natural gas  The State of Texas has 55 996 customer outages  according to EAGLE and additional utilities not captured in EAGLE  AEP Texas has 34 238 customer outages  a 2 9  increase from last report  Entergy  NYSE ETR  Texas has 14 409 customer outages  a 15  decrease from last report 
CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  has 4 746 customer outages  a 14 28  increase from last Entergy Texas will undergo a planned six hour outage for approximately 2 000 customers served by the Mayhaw Vidor Substation in the Viway area on Wednesday  Sept  6  Beginning at 11 00 AM EDT  they will be adding a transformer and related infrastructure that will bring other customers online as much as five days earlier than anticipated  CenterPoint Energy is reporting 99 79  of customers have power

120352,341867,ETR,Rising Interest Rates Make Life Tough For Utilities,opinion,"Though utility companies are among the safest investment bets  they have their share of weaknesses  Regulatory burdens  weather variation and increased debt loads are major concerns  While the Trump administration is expected to lower the industry s regulatory burden  an even bigger issue is the interest rate backdrop 
The Fed raised interest rates for three consecutive quarters  December 2016  March 2017 and June 2017   which is a drag for rate sensitive sectors like Utilities  Making things worse  the Fed might hike interest rates again in December  if economic conditions remain conducive 
Let s look into the factors which might deter investors from investing in the utility space 
Debt Levels   Rising Rates
Utilities are capital intensive and need to have a continuous inflow of funds to maintain organic growth and infrastructure upgrade projects  This is essential for maintaining an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities like electricity  fresh water and gas 
Utilities generate funds from operations which are to some extent used to meet their capital requirements  But these funds are mostly used for dividend payouts  They take recourse to external sources of financing to meet their capital requirements 
We believe that a rising interest rate environment could add to the woes of utility operators  as it will increase cost of capital  restraining their ability to pay consistent dividends  We suggest that investors take note of outstanding debts and current ratio  both of which indicate the company s ability to meet its debt obligations 
Weather a Headwind
Weather plays a vital role in driving demand for utility services  A normal winter and summer season assure higher demand for utility services  However  a milder winter and a cooler summer results in lower demand for utility services 
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas  ERCOT  in its recent release announced that since Hurricane Harvey hit the land  demand for electricity in Texas dropped to 20 000 megawatts  MW  per day  down from typical August demand of 44 000 MW  primarily due to structural damage and cooler temperature in the affected region 
We believe that the drop in demand  power outages and structural damage will impact the third quarter earnings goal of American Electric Power  AEP   CenterPoint Energy Inc  NYSE CNP    CNP  and Entergy Corporation  NYSE ETR   ETR   having operations in the region 
Hurricane Irma  a Category Five storm currently progressing toward Florida  could cause vast damage to utility infrastructure 
Competition with Bonds
These reliable dividend payers are in competition with bonds as an investment option  The ongoing increase in interest rates will definitely make bonds with its yields another attractive investment option for risk averse investors  driving them away from the utility space 
The Fed has increased the interest rate three times in the last three quarters  which will raise the cost of capital for the utilities and might adversely impact its ability to carry on with dividend payment and share buyback  making the high interest bearing bonds a more alluring option for investors 
Safe But Limited Growth Potential
Investment in these highly regulated defensive utilities is considered safe  Even though utilities pay regular dividends and go for buybacks  the scope of capital appreciation is quite limited for investors in this space  Share prices in this sector do not jump the way they do in the technology sector  so the returns are never dramatic 
Utilities to Avoid for the Time Being
We presently recommend investors to stay away from the following utilities having an unfavorable Zacks Rank  The other metrics also indicate that these utilities are not profitable investment options now 
Westar Energy currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   It saw an average negative surprise of 7 75  for the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings per share declined 0 4  in the last 90 days to  2 50  Westar has lost 9 3  year to date versus 10 2  rally of the Zacks  industry it belongs to 
Global Water Resources Inc   GWRS  saw an average negative surprise of 50  for the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings per share has decreased 36 4  over the last 90 days to 7 cents  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Global Water Resources stock has gained 3 4  year to date  much lower than Zacks  industry s gain of 10 3  
Bottom Line
We believe that focus on clean energy is going to be at the top of the utility companies agenda in the coming years  We expect utilities to take advantage of the shale boom in the United States and falling prices to develop power plants based on natural gas and renewable source of energy  Combined cycle natural gas power plants not only help to lower pollution but also result in energy efficiency 
We expect President Trump s view on climate change and plans to abandon the Paris agreement to be support fossil fuel based companies and help them survive the ongoing challenges  A makeover in the utility space is already underway  but the decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan will help the utilities continue with the coal fired units for longer than previously expected  The crucial question is  will the ongoing hike in interest rate offset the benefits of a favorable decision of the new administration

120380,341895,ETR,Should Value Investors Pick Entergy Corp   ETR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Entergy Corporation   NYSE ETR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Entergy Corp  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 18  This level compares considerably favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 06 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Entergy Corp  s current PE below its median  which stands at 11 39  over the observed period  Also  the current level is much below the highs experienced for the stock over the period  suggesting some level of undervalued trading in light of its own historical trend Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Utility   Electric Power industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 06  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Entergy Corp  has a P S ratio of about 1 25  This is slightly higher than the Zacks categorized Utility   Electric Power industry average  which comes in at 1 20 right now  Notably  the stock had always traded below the industry average P S level  until the beginning of 2017  ETR is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Entergy Corp  currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Entergy Corp  an apt choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 1 69  lower than the industry average of 1 72  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 84  which is far better than the industry average of 7 25  Clearly  ETR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Entergy Corp  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives ETR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been trending downwards lately  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen no upward revisions and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has moved lower by 2 4  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 4 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Entergy Corporation Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEntergy Corp  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 32  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past year  the Zacks Utilities   Electric Power industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as

120384,341899,ETR,Does Entergy  ETR  Make For A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Entergy Corporation   NYSE ETR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Entergy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 53  This level compares considerably favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 13 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Entergy s current PE near its median  which stands at 11 46  over the observed period  Notably  the current level is much below the highs experienced for the stock over the period  suggesting some level of undervalued trading in light of its own historical trend Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Utility   Electric Power industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 06  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Entergy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 94   that is lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Entergy stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Entergy has a P S ratio of about 1 27  This is lower than the Zacks categorized Utility   Electric Power industry average  which comes in at 1 40 right now  Notably  the stock has always traded below the industry average P S level  over the observed period  ETR is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Entergy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Entergy an apt choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 1 65  lower than the industry average of 1 74  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 02  which is far better than the industry average of 8 37  Clearly  ETR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Entergy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives ETR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant over the past month  while the full year estimate has jumped up 44   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Entergy Corporation Price and Consensus   The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Entergy is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineEntergy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 42  out of 265 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock Entergy is gradually shifting from a hybrid model to a pure play utility  which is expected to drive growth  Going forward  the company plans to make investments for the modernization of grid with evolving customer demand  Also  the company maintains a stable liquidity position that enables it to make notable investment plans   Moreover  to pursue growth opportunities in the generation business  the company has a strong project pipeline However  Entergy s low interest rate phase prevailing over the past few years have affected the company s pension and post retirement benefit expenses  Again  any adverse decision in pending regulatory cases can materially impact its earnings  Moreover  price fluctuations in wholesale power markets could be a growth deterrent Nevertheless  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics make this stock a compelling pick More Stock News  Tech Opportunity Worth  386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence  we ve seen an unsurpassed growth of high tech products in recent months  Yesterday s science fiction is becoming today s reality  Despite all the innovation  there is a single component no tech company can survive without  Demand for this critical device will reach  387 billion this year alone  and it s likely to grow even faster in the future Zacks has released a brand new Special Report to help you take advantage of this exciting investment opportunity   Most importantly  it reveals 4 stocks with massive profit potential ,2017-08-08,Zacks Investment

120431,341946,ETR,3 Utility Stocks That Will Pay You To Invest In Them,opinion,"Ever since the Great Recession  the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates artificially low  So low that investors who typically invest in bonds for the interest income they provide have had to look elsewhere  Unfortunately  there weren t many places to look  As a result  most investors turned to blue chip companies that were a relatively safe investment and paid a nice dividend  Enter utility stocks 
But not all utility stocks are equal  If you are looking for a safe place to park your money while earning a nice dividend  you have some research to do  Luckily that is where this post enters  There are 3 utility stocks out there that are a good place to put your money and they will pay you to own them through healthy dividend payments 
Understand that since these are stocks  you can lose money when the market drops  But they are solid companies and should not be as volatile as the market as a whole  And since they have had a pullback recently  now could be the time to get in  So what are these 3 utility stocks 
3 Utility Stocks That Pay You
 1  Southern Company  NYSE SO 
Southern Company was on a tear in 2016  rising close to 10   Even so  the stocks PE ratio is only 18 which leaves plenty of room for growth  While you cannot expect the stock to continue to return 10  annually  there is no reason why it won t continue to rise  albeit at a slower pace 
The reasons for continued stock appreciation include capital reinvestments in both new acquisitions and construction  In fact  the company is planning on spending close to  10 billion in acquisitions  which will certainly help drive growth 
When it comes to the dividend  Southern Company is currently yielding 4 6  and the payout ratio sits at 83   Many analysts are expecting Southern to raise its dividend in 2017  making it even more enticing to investors 
 2  Entergy  NYSE ETR 
Entergy has suffered from bad news recently  First  its   Now there is news with the company shutting down its Indian Point power plant early  As a result  investors have shied away from the stock and it is reflected in its PE ratio of 10 
But all hope is not lost with Entergy  Gas prices are slowly starting to rise which will help Entergy out and they are adding new customers in all segments   residential  business and government   which will also benefit the bottom line  The company increased its guidance for full year earnings back in October  so it will be interesting to see how it fares when earnings are released on February 15th 
Entergy is paying a healthy dividend currently  with its yield sitting at 4 9   The stock is down 12  from its high last summer as the bad news has had an impact on the stock price  As a result  this could be a good entry point to get a utility stock that pays a healthy dividend and is slowly growing 
 3  PPL Corporation  NYSE PPL 
PPL currently trades at  35 50 a share and has a PE ratio of 13  If you look at a long range chart of the company s stock performance you will see that after the market collapse of 2007  PPL stock has been on a slow  methodical climb 
And PPL has room to grow  They are committed to investing  16 billion in improving their infrastructure and making their electric grid more reliable and efficient  This includes working with solar companies to develop an industrial scaled battery storage facility 
As with Entergy above  PPL has faced a pull back in its stock price as well and is down 10  from its 2016 high  The company is currently paying a nice dividend and has announced an increase of close to 4   This brings its yield to 4 6  making it a nice utility stock to buy and hold long term 
Final Thoughts
There is a lot of potential upside when it comes to investing in utility stocks  With President Trump talking about deregulation in the industry as well as a push for more nuclear power  these utilities could continue to gain ground in the coming years 
The downside however is rising interest rates  As the   utility stocks could be affected as investors move back to bonds  But  the Fed already made clear its intent for interest rates this year and the market could be pricing the rise in already 
Additionally  it will be some time before interest rise enough to compete with the dividends that these utilities are paying  So for now and over the long term  investing in utility stocks for their healthy dividends is a wise move ",2017-02-14,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-utility-stocks-that-will-pay-you-to-invest-in-them-200175594,200175594

120500,342015,ETR,6 Stocks To Buy As Inflation Advances In September,opinion,In the latest sign of rising inflation  consumer prices continued to move upward during the month of September  This release adds further weight to PPI data released last week  which revealed that producer prices had also increased last month  The Fed now seems to have enough evidence to implement a rate hike later this year Rising costs of gasoline  higher rents and costlier electricity were some of the primary triggers for last month s higher consumer prices  Picking stocks gaining from this trend would be a good idea as the economy continues to strengthen CPI s Increase Highest in 5 MonthsThe consumer price index moved up 0 3  in September  following a 0 2  increase in August  This was the highest advance recorded over the last five months  Additionally  the index gained 1 5  on a year over year basis  the largest increase on a yearly basis since Oct 2014  In August  the CPI had gained 1 1  on a yearly basis More than half of the increase in CPI was attributable to a 5 8  increase in gasoline prices  However  core CPI  which excludes the costs of food and energy increased by only 0 1   lower than the 0 3  increase recorded in August  At the same time  rents  which make up a large chunk of core CPI experienced their largest rise in almost a decade Oil  REITs  and Power Find Favor Oil prices have firmed in the period following the landmark OPEC agreement on production controls  On Wednesday  Saudi Arabia s energy minister said that the continuing decline in oil prices was nearing an end  Meanwhile  favorable data has continued to bolster crude prices  In the latest such report  U S  domestic crude inventories declined for the week ending Oct 14 Despite the marginally weaker jobs report released this month  the labor market is on a stronger footing  Steady wage increases have also led to higher electricity demand  Meanwhile  last month was the warmest September in more than a century  according to NASA  providing a more immediate catalyst for incremental demand for power Coming to REITs  this sector remains in good health despite an imminent rate hike  A prolonged period of low interest rates and a housing recovery has given these organizations a favorable environment for growth and consolidation  Given that the Fed is still undecided on a rate hike  REITs could continue to enjoy a low interest rate regime for an extended period  With the job market in good health  consumers are in a position to pay the higher rents which REITS command Our ChoicesA rise in inflation bodes well for the economy and indicates that purchasing power is on the rise  Higher demand for gasoline  electricity and the capacity to pay higher rents bode well for companies gaining from such a trend Adding stocks from such sectors to your portfolios makes good sense at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V

The Reason BehindIn addition to all other challenges faced by utility companies  nuclear plant operators have recently been grappling with rising operating costs  The situation is further worsened by historically low prices of natural gas According to PG E  closing the Diablo Canyon facility will be more economical than operating them  Moreover  California is expected to see an increase in renewable generation  which will lower the demand of nuclear power plants  As costs of wind and solar energy continue to decline  post 2025  the plant will possibly be rendered useless as its output becomes exponentially expensive due to high fixed costs Similar Moves by PeersRising operating cost and declining revenues prompted Entergy Corporation   NYSE ETR    a diversified energy company  to cease operations of its Massachusetts based Pilgrim plant by May 2019 following a refueling outage in the spring of 2017 In a similar move  Exelon Corporation   NYSE EXC    a leading competitive power generator in the U S   has decided to shut down its loss making Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear power plants owing to the lack of progress on the Next Generation Energy Plan legislation  which could have helped to bring the plants back to profitability PG E Corporation currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A Key Pick in the SectorA better ranked peer in the same space includes Avangrid  Inc    NYSE AGR    sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ",2016-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pg-e-corporation-to-close-last-nuclear-plant-in-california-200137550,200137550

   Entergy is gradually transforming itself from a hybrid to a pure play utility  Foremost on its agenda is to lower its exposure to the risk prone and volatile wholesale commodities market by scaling down its Entergy Wholesale Commodities   EWC   business  This strategy is likely to be prudent as regulated spending offers a secured rate of return Entergy is looking to explore the potential of its core utility business  which operates in parts of Arkansas  Louisiana  Mississippi and Texas  Entergy believes adjusted earnings per share from its utility  parent and other segment could rise at roughly 5  to 7  a year The company has already closed the Vermont Yankee and RISEC units and will be shutting down Pilgrim and FitzPatrick by the end of 2019  The company will be left with Indian Point  which is currently profitable  and Palisades  which has a power purchase agreement through 2022  The company has outlined plans for growth at its utility segment and a smaller footprint at EWC  the home of merchant nuclear plants Overall  Entergy plans to invest  15 6 billion in the 2016 2020 time frame  with a major share going to its generation and transmission businesses  The company expects grid upgrades  asset replacement  and industrial load growth to drive earnings 
In addition to pursuing growth opportunities in the generation business  the company has a strong project pipeline and has secured the Louisiana Public Service Commission approval to replace 100 miles of pipe over the next 10 years  A combination of different types of projects will enable the company to diversify its revenue stream However  the performance of Entergy s regulated utilities depends upon rate relief at regular intervals in the company s different service areas  Any adverse decision in pending regulatory cases can materially impact Entergy s earnings Again  Entergy s financial performance is guided by price fluctuations in wholesale power markets  Wholesale power prices are a function of supply and demand  which in turn are driven by factors such as the price of fuels  particularly natural gas and coal   the rate of expansion of subsidized low carbon generation in the markets in which Generation s output is sold and the impacts on energy demand of factors such as weather  economic conditions and implementation of energy efficiency and demand response programs Zacks RankEntergy Corporation currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked peers include Avangrid  Inc    NYSE AGR    Spark Energy  Inc    NASDAQ SPKE   and CenterPoint Energy  Inc    NYSE CNP    While Avangrid and Spark Energy sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   CenterPoint carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/entergy-(etr)-veers-away-from-merchant-to-focus-on-utility-200137898,200137898

120590,342105,ETR,Investing In Central Utility Stocks  Do Today s Valuations Make Sense ,opinion,This is the third in my series on investing in utility stocks based on the sector s current valuation levels  The series was initially inspired by concerns that utility stocks may be overvalued because they had recently performed very well  When the series first started with Part 1  utility ETF s were showing the best one year performance of any sector  By the second installment   the utility sector had fallen into second place  Utility Sector Performance July 31  2012   Since that time  utilities have fallen into fifth place with year to date performance of only 3 8   see Utility Sector Performance August 3  2012 below   this could be an indication that utilities are reaching full value  Utility Sector Performance July 31  2012 Utility Sector Performance August 3  2012Central Utilities   A Review of Valuation The following table compares the valuations of the major Central utility stocks utilizing the F A S T  Graphs  portfolio review tool  The first two columns compare each company s current PE ratio to the PE ratio that the market has historically applied to each stock Based on this cursory analysis  the Central utility group appears fully valued  with many moderately overvalued  This is indicated when the current PE ratio is higher than the historical norm  Each individual company in this situation has been highlighted in green on the table for reader convenience  However  it s important to also add that due to the cyclical nature of many of these utilities  coupled with their low growth histories  makes it a challenge to ascertain fair value  Consequently  there are companies with low current PE ratios that appear overvalued when a specific earnings and price correlated graph is looked at  even though statistically speaking their PE ratio looks low  In other words  we are coming to the conclusion that the utility sector in general is one that is too treacherous to attempt to value as a group  Perhaps more than any other sector  this sector needs to be evaluated one company at a time  Furthermore  there are several issues regarding investing in utility stocks that are important to consider  As a general rule  the utility industry has been a low growth industry due to the regulated nature of much of its business  Many utilities are attempting to diversify their businesses away from the regulated side  However  it remains uncertain as to how successful these efforts might be The third column of the table below lists the historical past 15 years earnings growth  Only ITC Holdings Corp   ITC   Wisconsin Energy Corp   WEC  and Entergy Corp   ETR  have been able to generate double digit earnings growth  ITC s results are anomalous and this company will be featured in greater detail later  However  the reviewer might also notice by the estimated EPS column  that estimated growth for most companies is more optimistic  There was a time when electric transmission was ignored by utility management teams in favor of generation and distribution  This caused underinvestment in the transmission segment of the business  However  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  granted incentive returns on equity that stimulated investment in transmission  ITC Holdings Corp is the only transmission only investor owned utility  and as previously mentioned  will be covered in more detail later  However  many other Central utility companies are increasing their investment in transmission to include  American Electric Power  AEP   which has the largest transmission system  and ALLETE  ALE   Ameren  AEE  and OGE Energy Corp  OGE  are also getting more involved in transmission  All of this has been instigated by concern for reliability and the desire to connect mandated renewable energy products to the grid  as well as the capacity to import and export power  The typical utility stock attracts investor interest primarily with their yields  Central utility stocks are no different  However  just as I discovered with Western utilities  the long term dividend records of Central utilities are likewise spotty  Later  when I showcase individual examples  I will elaborate more on the dividend records of a few specific Central utility companies   ITC Holdings Corp  Only Investor Owned Transmission UtilityITC Holdings Corp   NYSE  ITC  is the nation s largest independent electric transmission company  Based in Novi  Michigan  ITC invests in the electric transmission grid to improve reliability  expand access to markets  lower the overall cost of delivered energy and allow new generating resources to interconnect to its transmission systems  ITC s regulated operating subsidiaries include ITCTransmission  Michigan Electric Transmission Company  ITC Midwest and ITC Great Plains Through these subsidiaries  ITC owns and operates high voltage transmission facilities in Michigan  Iowa  Minnesota  Illinois  Missouri  Kansas and Oklahoma  serving a combined peak load exceeding 26 000 megawatts along 15 000 circuit miles of transmission line  Through ITC Grid Development and its subsidiaries  the company also focuses on expansion in areas where significant transmission system improvements are needed Electric transmission is getting more focus and attention as a concept of an electronic grid analogous to the Internet  Currently there is only one investor owned utility that is solely invested in transmission  ITC Holdings The company was formed in 2002 when it acquired the transmission assets of DTE Energy  The company continues to buy the transmission assets from other utilities and is also building its own projects  ITC went public in July of 2005 I look at this company separately because not only is it unique within the electric utility industry  but the investment dynamics underpinning this company are unique as well  However  notice that the 60 8  earnings growth rate is skewed due to anomalous earnings growth from 2004 to 2005 This is a classic example of how statistics can be misleading  Moreover  we further see an example of where the normal PE ratio is more meaningful than the orange earnings justified valuation line  again  due to the skewed growth rate Therefore  in order to get a more reasonable and accurate picture of ITC Holding Corp  s growth  I have re drawn the graph from 2006 to current in order to exclude the aberrant number  With this shorter graph we discover that ITC Holdings Corp  has grown earnings substantially faster than the average regulated utility  To get an even clearer picture of this  the reader can examine the Chg Yr column at the bottom of the graph When you examine the performance associated with the above earnings and price correlated graph  you find returns that correlate with earnings growth  Consequently  ITC Holdings Corp  looks and performs more like a growth stock than a conservative utility MGE Energy Inc  MGEE   Overvalued ExampleMGE Energy is a public utility holding company  Its principal subsidiary  Madison Gas and Electric generates and distributes electricity to 139 000 customers in Dane County  Wis   and purchases and distributes natural gas to 144 000 customers in seven south central and western Wisconsin counties  MGE s roots in the Madison area date back more than 150 years MGE Energy Inc  appears to be a classic example of what you would expect a regulated utility to look like  The company s average earnings growth rate has been slightly higher than 4  per annum  However  a closer examination of the company s Chg Yr illustrates more inconsistencies than the picture implies  But most importantly  MGE Energy Inc  is clearly overvalued relative to historical norms  From a performance perspective  MGE Energy Inc   MGEE  has generated returns consistent with its operating record  Capital appreciation has closely approximated earnings growth at a slight premium due to current overvaluation  Although the company has consistently increased its dividend  the growth rate of their dividend has been rather anemic When you look at earnings forecasts  you discover that only one analyst is reporting on this company  A cross check with Zacks also shows only one analyst  This in itself is a red flag  however  the 4  estimated growth rate is at least in line with the company s historical achievement Vectren Corp   VVC Vectren Corporation  NYSE  VVC  is an energy holding company headquartered in Evansville  Ind  Vectren s energy delivery subsidiaries provide gas and or electricity to more than 1 million customers in adjoining service territories that cover nearly two thirds of Indiana and west central Ohio  Vectren s nonutility subsidiaries and affiliates currently offer energy related products and services to customers throughout the U S  These include infrastructure services  energy services  coal mining and energy marketing Vectren Corp provides yet another example of a low growth utility stock  The reader should notice that stock price has been relatively flat  see annual highs and lows highlighted in yellow  and has followed earnings since 1998  Clearly  and as we will soon see  investing in Vectren Corp is all about the dividend  as capital appreciation is extremely low Moreover  the company is clearly fully valued as it currently sits at its historically normal PE ratio  Consequently  an argument could be made that the company is too expensive to invest in it at this time  even though it is not excessively overvalued When we more closely examine Vectren Corp s performance  we discover exactly what we might expect  Capital appreciation is closely correlated with earnings growth  and the dividend growth rate is low but consistent  Clearly  this is a utility that you buy for the dividends  but you should be very careful what price you pay to buy it at Alliant Energy  LNT Alliant Energy Corporation is an energy holding company  Providing Midwest utility customers with safe and reliable electric and natural gas services is our top priority Our corporate headquarters are located in Madison  Wisconsin  General offices are located in Cedar Rapids and Dubuque  Iowa  utility operation facilities are located in communities throughout our utility service territory in Iowa  Minnesota and Wisconsin Alliant Energy shows an almost perfect example of the earnings and price relationship  Although the company s earnings have been moderately cyclical  the company s stock price tracks the earnings very closely  But more importantly  we see that the company s fair value calculated PE ratio of 15 almost perfectly correlates with its historical normal PE of 14 9  Therefore  a rather straightforward argument that the company is overvalued at its current PE ratio is vividly portrayed When we calculate performance associated with the above graph on Alliant Energy  LNT  we discover that capital appreciation correlates almost perfectly to earnings growth  Also  note that the company was slightly overvalued both at the beginning of this time period as well as currently  But perhaps the most important piece of information on this performance graph is the 50  dividend cut in 2003 Summary and ConclusionsAs we continue our examination of the utility sector  it is becoming eminently clear that the majority of utility stocks are currently fully valued  Although this is not to say that they are excessively overvalued  we must not forget that the concept of valuation is exaggerated when considering utilities  Because of very low growth rates that most of them possess  even slight overvaluation can relegate returns to below optimal levels Therefore  we suggest that prospective investors proceed with caution and carefully examine each company that they may be contemplating  In general  utility stocks are not high risk  and are known for high yields  However  they are not known for high growth

120600,342115,ETR,These Utility Stocks Are Surging,opinion,"The utility sector is in the midst of a business and technology transformation in the U S  Now with Obama s boldest attempt to address global warming  utilities are shifting their mode of power generation from coal fired electricity plants to natural gas and alternate energy sources with even more urgency  Global concerns about the pitfalls of green house gas emissions supported by increasing restrictions on fossil fuel usage have brought alternative energy into the limelight  The president s proposed new Environmental Protection Agency rule would reduce carbon emission from power plants by 30  by 2030  compared to 2005 levels  This shift from carbon to renewables has been happening for quite some time now  However  with the fresh carbon regulations on the way  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  forecasts approximately 60 gigawatts  GW  of coal plants  or 6  of the country s total capacity  will be forced to shut down by the end of the decade to meet evolving standards and regulations  However  this shift will bring about inevitable changes in the energy economy  Looking at the economic perspective  the rules could cost the U S  economy  50 billion per annum with the forced shutdown of coal fired plants by 2030  eliminating 224 000 jobs  according to the U S  Chamber of Commerce  Although the recent regulation could pose a threat to the sector  let s not forget that utility services play a major role in a nation s economic progress  as cheap and abundant supply of power keeps the wheels of development rolling  Admittedly  the fortunes of some industries are more allied to the overall economy than others  very few have shown as little volatility and are as stable as the utility sector  The times are indeed uncertain given the Iraqi insurgency  the lingering political tensions between Russia and Ukraine  concerns of a slowdown in China and less than expected growth in Japan  To add to the woes  the World Bank has cut its global economic growth forecast lately  sending jitters across the equity markets  For risk averse investors the utility sector seems to be a good bet in uncertain times  Demand for utility services stay primed no matter what the economy is doing    Moreover  utilities have been known to pay dividends consistently  thereby retaining the confidence of yield hungry investors and proving yet again the sector s defensive characteristics  Given this backdrop  selecting the correct stocks may appear to be a daunting task  Given the positive sentiment  it might be a good idea to bet on three top ranked utility stocks that are soaring on the bourses this year 
Entergy Corporation  NYSE ETR 
New Orleans  LA based Entergy is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power  This Zacks Ranked  1  Strong Buy  stock delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 6 15   The company posted impressive first quarter 2014 results with its earnings outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimates on higher wholesale electricity prices owing to a harsh winter and higher revenues from the northeast nuclear fleet in the U S 
Entergy has already accomplished the required emission cuts by making the plants more efficient and relying heavily on nuclear power  which does not directly emit carbon dioxide  Hence  Entergy s nuclear fleet gives the company a distinct advantage over its fossil fuel based competitors  The cost cutting efforts at Entergy  strong industrial growth in the Gulf Coast and improvement in forward power prices in the Northeast will help the company to sustain its strong performance  Retail sales growth in its service territories will further benefit the company  Entergy continues to focus on maximizing shareholder value through regular dividend payouts  backed by a stable financial position  Currently  the company has an annual dividend yield of 4 2   much higher than the industry average of 3 4   With a forward P E of 12 74x  the stock price has gained an impressive 29 6  year to date 
NRG Energy Inc  NYSE NRG 
NRG Energy  another Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  is diversifying its generation mix with the expansion of renewable assets  The company s recent acquisition of the assets of Edison Mission Energy  a subsidiary of Edison International  NYSE EIX   and Roof Diagnostics Solar will support its renewable asset expansion program  The company s power plants generate electricity using a wide array of fuel sources with gas accounting for 54  last year  The stock price has increased 31 3  so far this year and it has a forward P E of 17 97x  The company has a long term expected growth rate of 6 4   The addition of renewable assets and the inking of long term power supply contracts will enable NRG Energy to secure a stable cash inflow going forward 
Cia Paranaense de Energia  NYSE ELP 
Companhia Paranaense de Energia  also known as COPEL  is a fully integrated electric utility in Brazil  The company is engaged in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity to the State of Paran   This Zacks Ranked  1  Strong Buy  company posted impressive results for first quarter 2014 with its net income surging 46 3  year over year  COPEL has solid long term growth prospects  as the country steps up its focus on infrastructural developments and investments aimed at improving electricity generation capacity  The Brazilian electricity market is the largest in South America  Energy consumption in the country rose 3 5  last year  With a market cap of  4 08 billion  COPEL has a long term expected growth rate of 10 45   With a forward Price Earnings  P E  of 7 45x  the stock surged 25 1  so far this year and still has enough fundamentals to drive it upward  Its annual dividend yield of 4 2  is higher than the industry average of 3 4   This makes the company an attractive bet for investors looking for steady income 
Bottom Line The biggest positive for the utilities is that there is hardly any viable substitute for their services  This is the most fundamental strength of the industry  Moreover  increasing demand drives this industry forward  We expect more investment in natural gas and alternate energy projects  wrenching the initiative from the pure play coal based electricity companies ",2014-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-utility-stocks-are-surging-216836,216836
120601,342116,ETR,Entergy Shows Top Line Stability,opinion,"On Nov 7  2014  we issued an updated research report on a New Orleans  LA based Entergy Corporation  ETR   This utility company remains primarily engaged in the production and retail distribution of electric power  Shares of the company have soared 29  so far this year  outperforming the 10 26  gain of the S P 500 over the same period 
In its third quarter 2014 earnings release  although the company met the Street expectation  its earnings fell over 30  from the year ago level due to a decline in earnings at the Utility  Entergy Wholesale Commodities  and Parent and Other segments  Entergy also expects its full year earnings to remain below the mid point of the guided range  On the other hand  Entergy s total operating revenues surpassed the Street consensus by 8 6   Reported revenues also increased 3 2  year over year primarily due to an improvement in Electric  4 4   and Natural Gas  7 4   sales  Its Utility business posted the fifth straight quarter over quarter industrial sales growth and the second straight quarter of over 5  growth in the third quarter  To attract industry and generate employment  Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana asked the Louisiana Public Service Commission  LPSC  to approve their merging into a single utility  Combining the two companies will enable Entergy to make the required investments in Louisiana power infrastructure  The move will improve the company s ability to draw capital while providing more flexibility  By 2019  the two companies expect up to 1 600 megawatts  MWs  of industrial load growth  Entergy s nuclear fleet  along with its complementary and flexible fossil and hydro fleets  gives the company a distinct generation cost advantage over its fossil fuel based competitors  Steady investments in installing scrubbers and other emission control equipment at its facilities will enable the company to curb carbon emissions effectively  thereby meeting environmental regulations  In the third quarter  Entergy s nuclear plants operated well posting a 90  capacity factor at EWC with fewer unplanned outage days  In addition to pursuing pollution control measures  the company has a strong project pipeline and intends to start the new Big River steel plant in Arkansas  Entergy has already completed the expansion of an existing steel mill  A combination of different types of projects will enable the company to diversify its revenue stream  Apart from utilizing funds for growth projects  Entergy continues to focus on maximizing shareholder value through the regular payment of dividends  Currently  the company offers an annual dividend yield of 4 1   much higher than the industry average of 2 1  Key Picks in the Sector Entergy presently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the same sector include Black Hills Corporation  NYSE BKH   Pacific Gas   Electric Co  NYSE PCG  and Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED   Black Hills and PG E sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Consolidated Edison holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2014-11-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/entergy-shows-top-line-stability-232520,232520
