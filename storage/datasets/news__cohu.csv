8060,229575,COHU,5 Top Ranked Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Amid Slowdown In 2019,opinion,The U S  manufacturing industry is facing severe challenges in 2019 owing to the lingering trade conflict and tariff war with China  Trade related jitters have also resulted in a global manufacturing downturn  The U S  economy has lost pace although it is growing for the 11th year on the trot  In spite of these negatives  a few manufacturing stocks popped in the past six months and still have upside left Tarde War Hurts Business SpendingA prolonged trade conflict with China has resulted in a tariff war wherein duties have been levied on hundreds of billion dollars on each other s goods  The U S  government has already levied 25  tariff on more than  300 billion of Chinese goods mostly used as cheap inputs for the technology and industrial sectors  On the other hand  China imposed tariffs on more than  100 billion U S  products mainly from the agricultural sector Imposition of tariff on China made  low cost intermediary products raised the input cost of U S  manufacturers  Consequently  U S  business spending dropped significantly in 2019  The Institute of Supply Management reported that U S  manufacturing activities contracted for four consecutive months from August to November Is Slowdown in Business Spending Bottoming Out On Nov 27  the Department of Commerce reported that new orders

aircraft  jumped 1 2  in October The core durable goods data for October indicate that business spending is likely to continue although the pace may decline considerably  Therefore  stabilization of business investment in October will act as a relief to the manufacturing sector  Additionally  new orders for core capital goods is a leading metric to calculate equipment spending in the U S  government s GDP measurement  Notably  manufacturing activities constituted nearly 12  of U S  GDP Uncertainty Over Partial Trade DealThe phase one deal between the United States and China needs to be signed by Dec 15  after which the U S  government is scheduled to impose a new round of tariffs on  160 billion of Chinese goods  The Trump administration can also raise the tariff rate on  250 billion of Chinese goods already under the U S  tariff system On Nov 29  Reuters reported that the U S  government may exercise its power to stop more foreign shipments of products with U S  technology to China s telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies  Further  on Dec 10  The Wall Street Journal reported that the U S  Congress is considering introducing a new bill aiming to restrict the use of government funds to purchase Chinese busses and railcars However  on Dec 10  Bloomberg reported that Chinese authority is expecting President Trump to postpone fresh tariffs on the Asian economic

8062,229577,COHU,5 Stocks With Recent Price Strength That Still Have Upside,opinion,While Wall Street has performed remarkably in 2019  the last month is looking even more spectacular buoyed by strong economic data  especially labor market data  Generally  December remains a good month for stock investors  Holiday sales usually pick up this month However  some concerns remain  Global economy is yet to show signs of recovery  The U S  manufacturing industry is still suffering from weakness although recently released industrial production data for November was better than expected  Moreover  phase one trade deal is yet to be signed by the presidents of the United States and China So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Just these few criteria have narrowed down the search from over 7 700 stocks to just fourteen Here we present five stocks out of the fourteen Tilly s Inc    NYSE TLYS   retails casual apparel  footwear  and accessories for young men and women  and boys and girls in the United States  It also

8076,229591,COHU,5 Momentum Stocks Backed By Driehaus Strategy,opinion,Investors with strong risk appetite generally focus on momentum stocks for attractive returns  The Driehaus strategy isone such investment approach for those interested in momentum stocks  Richard Driehaus prepared this investing strategy using the  buy high and sell higher  principle  The success of this policy eventually helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  gains registered by the S P 500  Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2   Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business   Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median  Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks   Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5   Positive EPS surprise indicates potential   Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks  High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend   Momentum Score equal to or less than B  Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7 855 stocks to only 29 Here are five of the 29 stocks Jones Lang LaSalle Inc    NYSE JLL   is a financial and professional services company  It has a Momentum Score of A and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 17 8  Infinity Property and Casualty Corp    NASDAQ IPCC   is a provider of personal automobile insurance products  The company has a Momentum Score of B and an average

8077,229592,COHU,4 Compelling Low Beta Tech Stocks In The Market Right Now,opinion,Currently  stock markets are flying high  courtesy of a favorable GDP growth rate  rising disposable income  an improving labor market with unemployment rate at a 16 year low  rise in economic activity post hurricanes and a low inflation rate  All these have considerably boosted consumer sentiment  which hit a 17 year high in November Since the market is on an upward trajectory  investing in risky stocks will yield huge returns  However  one cannot ignore the various micro and macro factors that can lead to volatility when they come into play Uncertainties That May Loom LargeMarket expectations for tax reform have increased as the GOP tax bill passed the Senate Budget Committee on a party line vote  Though chances of the bill being passed by the full Senate have increased considerably  a failure in this regard could make the S P 500 slip Again  the Fed has started reducing its balance  It s worth noting that this event has had an adverse impact in the past  KM Partners data shows that five out of six times the Fed has made efforts to reduce its balance sheet  it has resulted in a recession  So  this sentiment can lead to market volatility going forward especially if the Fed takes up a hawkish approach  As of now  the Fed is taking it easy and therefore chances of market disruption are low Further  heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea can also cause stocks to fall  Though a full fledged war is unlikely  investors will surely prefer to move out of high risk stocks Invest in Low Beta StocksIn this scenario  it will be wise to add some safe bets to your portfolio  Such a portfolio can be easily created based on the low beta strategy  which selects stocks less prone to risks than the market Beta  also known as the beta coefficient  measures the volatility of a stock against broader markets  It measures the extent to which a stock s return may be affected or its price fluctuates owing to market conditions  Stocks with a beta ranging from 0 to 1 mainly show less volatility than the broader markets So  investors can neutralize losses with low correlation stocks as they are less prone to day to day fluctuations Our Choices from the Tech SectorHere  we have handpicked four low beta stocks from the technology sector with a beta of less than 1  carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and a  of A or B Ohta ku  Tokyo based Canon Inc    NYSE CAJ   sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a beta of 0 45 and a VGM Score of B You can see Canon  an industry leader in professional and consumer imaging equipment and information systems  has witnessed 15 2  increase in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for full year 2017 over the last 60 days  Adding further to its inherent strength  the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 17 9  over the past four quarters  Its earnings are projected to improve 65 6  year over year Canon  Inc  Price and Consensus   Investors can also count on Five9  Inc    NASDAQ FIVN   with beta as low as 0 32  The company came up with an average trailing four quarter earnings surprise of 200   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for full year 2017 has increased more than 100  over the last 60 days  instilling confidence among investors  This San Ramon  CA based provider of cloud software for data centers can be a good fit  backed by its Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of B  Its earnings are projected to increase a massive 210 2  year over year Five9  Inc  Price and Consensus   To satiate investor appetite further  we suggest investing in Cohu  Inc    NASDAQ COHU    Headquartered in Poway  CA  this Zacks Rank  2 company is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers  micro electro mechanical system  MEMS  test modules  test contactors and thermal sub systems worldwide  The company boasts of a solid earnings surprise history  beating estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 63 1   It also has exhibited favorable estimate revisions trend for 2017 over the past 60 days  Further  its projected EPS growth of 131 9  underscores its solid prospects  If this doesn t appear enough  one can take a look at its VGM Score of A and beta of 0 89 Cohu  Inc  Price and Consensus   Another company that warrants a look is Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd    NASDAQ NVMI    with beta of 0 91  This Ness Ziona  Israel based company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a VGM Score of A  The stock delivered an average four quarter earnings surprise of 19 31   Further  fiscal 2017 estimates for Nova Measuring have moved up over the past 60 days  Moreover  its projected EPS growth rate of

Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
The small cap stocks have taken the lead in 2018  It s been several years since the small caps have broken out before the large caps  It s usually the other way around 
For value investors  that means this is an opportunity to buy small cap value stocks which have historically been the best performers among equities 
But where do you even look for  good  small cap value stocks 
Screening for Small Cap Value
There are simply too many small cap stocks  It s vital for investors to use a screen to narrow it down  Tracey used a forward P E of 15 and a market cap of  1 billion  to get the basic small cap value stocks 
But she also added the Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy   which will likely produce rising earnings estimates as well  And that means there may also be earnings growth 
If you re going to buy value  why not get some growth in there too 
The combination of value plus earnings growth is pretty rare but it makes for a powerful combination 
With all of those qualifiers  the screen returned 88 stocks  including a lot of smaller  community banks and several home builders 
Out of that screen  these 5 stocks stood out

8095,229610,COHU,Infosys  INFY  Weighed Down By Visa Scare  Weakening Sales,opinion,"Over the last few months  India s premium technology behemoth  Infosys Limited   NYSE INFY   has grabbed headlines for all the wrong reasons  Heightening fears involving H 1B visa program  conflict within the top brass  rumors of a stake sale by founders and bad press have been doing the rounds  maligning the reputation of India s second largest IT firm 
Though management has nullified rumors of a stake sale  it appears that the other challenges will continue to spook investors  at least in the short run  The share price movement over the past three months mirrors the troubling times  as Infosys  shares have lost 3 8  against the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 2 0   Analysts also have their fair share of apprehensions over the company s prospects  and their estimates show a similar trend  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2017 earnings has inched down from 98 cents to 97 cents  due to three downward estimate revisions versus none upward 
The clouds hanging over the company were strongly reflected in its latest annual filing of the company with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
Given its array of problems  we believe that Infosys is in for an even bumpier ride in the foreseeable future  Let s take a deeper look at the headwinds  which have significantly thwarted the company s growth drive 
Heightening Visa Scare
The unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the presidential election had sent the Indian IT industry into panic mode  as frontrunners feared Trump s stance on anti immigration policies  Six months later  matters are still looking unclear as no major changes have materialized yet  However  it is hard to ignore the deafening echo of Trump s  Buy American  Hire American  program 
Infosys is already feeling the heat   just last month  it had announced plans to hire about 10 000 American workers over the next two years  The company has decided to stop junior employees from applying for H 1B visas to ease things out  The changing times are a direct threat to the company s economical cost structure  which focuses on using its workforce on site located abroad  Infosys  profitability remains questionable till matters relating to the migration policy become clearer 
Boardroom Bickering
If the external troubles are not enough  in the past few weeks  trouble within the top tier of the management has surfaced  making matters worse  There have been reports about a tussle between the founder and promoters of the company  The company s board has received flak from its co founder  N R  Narayana Murthy  over the high compensation of Vishal Sikka  the company s CEO and MD 
Rumors of the boardroom bickering continue further  Some sources claim that Murthy has asked chairman R  Seshasayee to step down   However  in a recent interview with Financial Times  Seshasayee denied rumors of the conflict 
Weakening Demand
Infosys  biggest problem at the moment might be the weakening demand of its traditional business  which has put its top line under pressure  Rapid proliferation of customizable internet based software has been hampering Infosys  traditional outsourcing business  The company is struggling with a precipitous decline in client spending  which continues to thwart growth 
Most clients now prefer to seek service delivery through digital technology  adding to Infosys  woes  Also  slower project ramp ups in large deals are adding to its challenges  The company  considered as a gauge for the health of the  3 trillion global enterprise spending market  reduced its guidance for fiscal 2018 to 6 1 8 1   which is much lower than the market s expectations 
Also  intensifying competition from established IT peers as well as new competitors is likely to pressurize margins  In fact  the company s growth forecast is lower than that of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation   NASDAQ CTSH    which expects to grow between 8 10   In light of these intensifying problems  the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has not confirmed its ambitious  20 billion revenue and 30  operating margin target  expected to achieve by 2021  in its 2016 17 annual report  
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the broader sector include Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT   and Cohu  Inc    NASDAQ COHU    Both Applied Materials and Cohu sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
With four back to back beats  Applied Materials has an average positive surprise of 3 3  for the trailing four quarters 
Cohu has a striking earnings surprise history  with an average positive surprise of 121 2  for the trailing four quarters  beating estimates all through

Technologies is expected to enhance its respiratory care portfolio as well The latest Electrical Geodesics acquisition is in line with the company s ambition to  fortify its footprint in the budding

8117,229632,COHU,Bet On These 7 Stocks Near A 52 Week High,opinion,To make the most of the market s recent bull run  place your bets on winning stocks that are scaling new highs  In such a market  wagering on solid momentum stocks in a timely manner can help you make some quick bucks  In this screening article  we discuss the 52 week investment strategy  which loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing  One of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook  the 52 week investment strategy  relies on the new investment mantra   buy high and sell higher   A wide group of investors are placing their bets on stocks which are hovering around their 52 week high mark  Also  they are opting for stocks that are currently undervalued but have strong upside potential However  this touch and go strategy should not be followed blindly without a fool proof plan  To make the gamble worthwhile  it is imperative to club the 52 week high price criteria with a set of other parameters  Meanwhile  our 52 week high screen singles out stocks that can be counted on Crossing the 52 Week High MarkMany a times  stocks nearing 52 week highs are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential  Psychological bias on part of investors  who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending  prevents them from scaling higher  These investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Prolonged under reaction makes these stocks remain undervalued  However  sooner or later  the markets get a whiff of it and investors realize that their lack of enthusiasm is unwarranted  A string of positive developments and renewed interest help stocks steer past the 52 week high bar and scale higher The ones who get in before the positive developments and the pricing in of growth factors benefit the most  Also  research reveals that current price levels reflect a stock s momentum better than past changes  This implies that if a stock is trading close to its 52 week high  chances are that it will perform better in subsequent periods Setting the Right FiltersOur screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will maintain their rally for quite some time now Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   2It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   2This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedThe lower  the better P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism Zacks Rank   1No screening is complete without our Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have at all times managed to brave adversities and beat the market  You can see  Current Price    5This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at  5 or higher Volume   20 days  shares     100000Inclusion of this

COHU Technical Analysis



COHU opened trading yesterday at  13 37 which was exactly the same as the previous day s trading close  Shares closed trading yesterday at  13 64 and spiked up after market to  14 85  equivalent to a 9  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time COHU traded above these levels we have to go all the way back to March 2011 when it traded at  15 36 

Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up COHU had already been in an overall upward trend dating back to October 26th  2016 when it traded at  10 80  COHU has a float of 25 8 million shares and traded 1 86 times the normal daily trading volume on Thursday  For trading purposes  I would like to see COHU open trading on Friday above  14 45 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up
