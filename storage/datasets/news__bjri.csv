8315,229830,BJRI,Is BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  A Good Value Investor Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BJ s Restaurants has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 8  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 29  If we focus on the long term PE trend  BJ s Restaurants  current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 24 16 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 85  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that BJ s Restaurants has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 04  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for BJ s Restaurants  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BJ s Restaurants has a P S ratio of about 0 7  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 51 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BJ s Restaurants currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BJ s Restaurants a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for BJ s Restaurants is just 1 39  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 09  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 68  which is better than the industry average of 11 38  Clearly  BJRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though BJ s Restaurants might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of F  This gives BJRI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to two downward revisions  while the full year 2020 estimate has also seen no upward revision compared to two downward revisions in the same time period The current year consensus estimate declined 1 04  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate fell 5 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BJ s Restaurants  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which is why we are looking for underperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBJ s Restaurants is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a Zacks Rank  4  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall Moreover  over the past year  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has

8332,229847,BJRI,Buy These 5 Stocks With Attractive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 26 stocks

8334,229849,BJRI,Will Slower Growth Impact Fastenal s  FAST  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jun 11  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 5   Notably  it surpassed the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters  while met the same once  with average positive earnings surprise of 4 2  Markedly  first quarter 2019 earnings and revenues recorded an improvement of 11 9  and 10 4   respectively  courtesy of higher market demand  and growth in the industrial vending business and existing Onsite locations How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter has declined from 38 cents to 37 cents over the past 60 days  This indicates flat growth with the year ago level  Revenues are expected to be  1 38 billion  up 8 8  year over year Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise   Key FactorsWe expect the U S  industrial market to grow in the second quarter  albeit at a slower rate than in 2018  thereby driving high single digit revenue growth  Over the past couple of months  Fastenal sales have softened on a year over year basis  with average daily sales growth in April and May coming in at 7 4  and 9 5   respectively  Average daily sales growth was recorded at 13 2  and 12 2  in fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019  respectively  Growth at this level ahead will mark a deviation from management s expectation of double digit growth in 2019  attributable to a combination of company specific drivers  i e  Onsite  vending  and price realization Management noted that there have been some signs of slower growth in the market  Nonetheless  performance rebounded slightly in May from the slower results reported in April across all markets and product lines served by Fastenal Growth in core product offerings like Onsite Locations vending machines managed inventory is expected to benefit Fastenal in the second quarter of 2019 Higher Non Residential End Market Demand  Construction market  especially non residential and manufacturing  is expected to act as a major tailwind for Fastenal s performance in the quarter Vending Machines to Drive Growth  Over the last few quarters  Fastenal s sales have been driven by increased installation of industrial vending machines  Sales through vending devices continued to grow at a double digit pace  primarily due to higher installed base Onsite Locations to Boost Sales  A consistent increase in the number of on site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal s market share and boost quarterly numbers  The increased number of onsite locations is likely to expand its market share  The trend is expected to continue in second quarter 2019 as well  The company aims at achieving 375 400 onsite signings in 2019  reflecting an increase from 336 a year ago In a nutshell  sustained strength in most of its end markets served  and strong momentum in vending machine installations and onsite locations are likely to support top line growth in the to be reported quarter Gross Margin Pressure  Fastenal s changes in product and customer mix have been hurting gross margin for quite some time now  Increased product costs  higher freight expenses  and changes in product and customer mix are expected to impact its second quarter gross margin Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Our proven model does not suggest that Fastenal is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 28  as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 36 cents  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Fastenal currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s  3 28  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions You can see  Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Zacks  sector  which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarters to be reported GMS Inc    NYSE GMS   has an Earnings ESP of  0 32  and a Zacks Rank  3 Urban Outfitters  Inc    NASDAQ URBN   has an Earnings ESP of  2 23  and holds a Zacks Rank  3 BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   has

rally of 13  Although BJ s Restaurants is focusing on cost savings and has reduced cost of sales and labor expenses  pre opening costs  higher marketing expenses and costs related to sales boosting initiatives might weigh on margins  Particularly  slow roasting ovens and handheld tablets are bumping up costs for the restaurateur  The company is also facing high general and administrative expenses which increased 9  year over year in 2018 Also  lack of check growth and severe weather conditions have made the company slightly apprehensive of earnings growth in 2019  The lower than

restaurants will also see a 5 2  growth compared with 5  in 2018 However  the industry is not totally out of harm s way  Although sales started recovering from the fourth quarter of 2017  the industry has been bearing the brunt of declining traffic and intense competition Per an   the restaurant industry is expected to face near term concerns such as rising food and wage costs which will eat into profits  Moreover  recent data shows that there is an oversupply of restaurants in the United States  inducing fierce competition among operators  Sectors like grocery store prepared food and

when it comes to delivery  mobile order and pay  and loyalty membership  The company is increasingly shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand its customer base  It adopted a high grade delivery strategy that aids collaborating with aggregators to source traffic and fulfills orders by the company s KFC riders  This is expected to help the company simultaneously drive volume and

high cost of operations  Further  sales building efforts such as promotional activities and a convincing pricing strategy are detrimental to margins  Apart from this  competition  high wage and food cost inflation remain concerns However  the industry has been gaining from increased consumer spending and restaurateurs  focus on digital innovation  The fourth quarter has borne fruits of increased consumer spending  steady rise in wages and lower unemployment  Also  most of the restaurant operators have been continuously partnering with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive

8397,229912,BJRI,6 Stocks To Profit From The  January Effect  ,opinion,Stocks posted back to back gains on Jan 7  igniting hopes that a revival is in the works after the most dismal December since the Great Depression  This was in keeping with the historical phenomenon known as the January Effect  This is a direct result of investors selling stocks at the end of a year in order to offset capital gains  only to redeploy funds obtained from these sales at the start of the New Year Tech stocks  the darlings of the bourses till last year  seem to have found fresh favor with investors  This is evident from the interest shown in Netflix s   NASDAQ NFLX   stock  which is recovering from a dismal second half of last year  Meanwhile  bullish jobs data and trade talks are boosting retail stocks  Investing in tech and retail would enable you to make the most of this January Effect Understanding the January EffectTo correctly understand this phenomenon  it is necessary to examine December s stock rout more closely  The majority of market watchers have ascribed these losses to President Trump s tweets and his protectionist trade policies  However  one factor that has been largely ignored is tax selling According to DataTrek Research co founder Nicholas Colas  this tax fueled sell off will lead to a rebound in January  This is because when fund managers are face falling stock prices  they don t just sell winners to reap profits  Some losers are also sold to offset the increase in tax liability caused by capital gains Colas thinks this sort of tax selling did occur in December  The sales proceeds are now being reinvested in equity markets  leading to gains in January  According to Matrixtrade com s Ed Matts the S P 500 has gained 1 8  on average in January since 1950  This is substantially better than the average increase of 0 7  recorded for other months Can Positives Outweigh Negatives This Month There is some evidence to show that the influence of this effect has declined since it was discovered in 1976  At the same time  a good January for stocks has a strong correlation with strong annual performance in the months to follow  Matts puts its correlation coefficient at 0 25  which is significantly strong  while it is only 0 016 for other months Ultimately  it is important to evaluate the factors at play at this point in order to determine whether the January Effect will come true this time around  A long and bruising trade war with China and a partial government shutdown are the major negatives confronting investors this month However  progress is more than evident on the trade talk front with China s vice premier Liu He attending negotiations with top U S  officials on Jan 7  Strong jobs  numbers are providing fresh evidence that the U S  economy remains robust  boosting retail stocks in the process And tech stocks  which had fallen out of favor with investors  are rebounding   The likes of NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA    Twitter   NYSE TWTR    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and salesforce com   NYSE CRM   gained 5 3   4 6   3 4  and 3 1   respectively  on Jan 7   Our ChoicesMarket watchers think that the gains recently experienced by stocks can be ascribed to a historical phenomenon called the January Effect  As a result  tech stocks have once again found favor with investors  Retailer stocks are also witnessing gains  also boosted by a bullish jobs report Investing in tech and retail would enable you to reap maximum benefits from the January effect this year  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select

8398,229913,BJRI,Top 5 Stocks With Solid Earnings Beat Potential ,opinion,"Tapping stocks that come up with solid earnings is a common practice  But instead of picking them post earnings  investing in those that are like to beat market expectations may increase your gains manifolds 
Why Is Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals are in question 
There is also the factor of seasonal fluctuation  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are ambiguous while judging the company s true health 
Meanwhile  Wall Street analysts study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to arrive at an earnings estimate  So  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception  And if the company manages to surpass earnings by a wide margin  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
How to Find Those Gems 
Since it is hard to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  A notable track record generally acts as a tailwind  It revs up chances of beating estimates in the next release too as investors expect the company to use the same old trick to surpass expectations  or is smart enough to pull off a beat in the next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around eight 
Here are five of the eight stocks that passed the screen 
BJ s Restaurants Inc     NASDAQ BJRI     The company owns and operates restaurants  located in the United States  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks sector  top 31    It has a Zacks Rank  1 
Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc     NYSE RH     The company is a luxury brand in the home furnishings marketplace  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks sector  top 31   and carries a Zacks Rank  1

8416,229931,BJRI,These 5 Stocks Sport Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market

Up These 5 Stocks with Amazing Interest Coverage RatiosA layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real time stock screen  A critical analysis of a company s financial background is essential for a better investment decision Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the real picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here  the role of coverage ratios comes into play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  One should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

8433,229948,BJRI,Darden  DRI  Strategic Efforts Bode Well  Should You Hold ,opinion,"Shares of Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI   are riding high on sales building initiatives  improved core operating fundamental  Cheddar s acquisition and impressive earnings trend  As a result  shares of the company have rallied 28  in a year s time  outperforming the s 10 8  growth  However  higher operating expenses remain a concern  Let s delve deeper 
Hidden Catalysts
Darden s acquisition of the small restaurant chain  Cheddar s Scratch Kitchen  Cheddar s   in April 2017 has added an undisputed casual dining value to the company s portfolio of differentiated brands  It also helped Darden to expand its scale further  In the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Cheddar s total sales grew 6 5  driven by organic new restaurant growth and franchise restaurant acquisition growth of 10 5  
In order to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand  the company implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan  These initiatives included simplifying kitchen systems  improving sales planning and scheduling as well as operational excellence to enhance guest experience  developing new core menu items  allowing customization  and making smarter promotional investments 
Supported by these initiatives  Olive Garden posted the 16th consecutive quarter of positive comps in first quarter fiscal 2019  Meanwhile  Darden is focusing on technology driven initiatives like the system wide rollout of tablets in order to capitalize on the digital wave that has hit the U S  fast casual restaurant sector  This initiative has already boosted sales over the past few quarters 

 
At LongHorn  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company strives to attract its guests by focusing on core menu  culinary innovation and providing regional flavors  Darden is also working on its marketing strategy to improve execution  customer relationship management and digital advertising as well as build a strong promotional pipeline that leverage the segment s expertise 
Meanwhile  the company continues to focus on strengthening its in restaurant execution through strategic investments in quality and simplification of operations in order to augment the guest experience  Backed by these strategic efforts  segmental comps have registered growth for 22 consecutive quarters 
Concerns
Increased wages and costs incurred due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act resulted in higher labor costs  This  in turn  is expected to persistently keep profits under pressure  The company s non franchised model also makes it susceptible to increased expenses 
Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden  instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs into the franchisee  the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business 
Total operating costs and expenses increased 6 3  year over year to  1 9 billion  This uptick can be attributed to an overall increase in food and beverage costs  restaurant labor and expenses  and marketing costs  Consequently  operating margin in the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis 
Key Picks
Some better ranked stocks in the same space are Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN    Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY   and BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

8450,229965,BJRI,5 Stocks That Sport Remarkable Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision  A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio   the Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all

8489,230004,BJRI,Brinker  EAT  Strategic Plans Bode Well  Should You Hold ,opinion,"Shares of Brinker International  Inc    NYSE EAT   are riding high on aggressive expansion and sales building initiatives  digital capabilities as well as remodeling efforts  Evidently  the stock has rallied 33 7  in a year  outperforming the  s 3 9  upside 
However  a slowdown in some of the key international markets and overall high costs associated with restaurant operations remain major concerns for the company  Let s delve deeper 
Hidden Catalysts
Brinker remains steadfast in its goal to boost traffic and revenues through a range of sales building initiatives like streamlining of menu and its innovation  strengthening its value proposition  better food presentation  advertising campaigns  kitchen system optimization and introduction of better service platform  In 2016  the company also initiated a strategic plan   Vision 2020   to propel revenues 
Markedly  this plan focuses on menu innovation in Chili s  and consistent improvement in service and atmosphere to differentiate the brand and gain market traction for achieving long term earnings per share growth target in the 10 15  range 
Furthermore  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is gearing up for international expansion  especially in faster growing emerging markets  Though it is experiencing some headwinds in the Middle East  Brinker s Latin American business has been solid 
Additionally  the company is on the lookout to expand its brand in existing markets and enter new ones  In fiscal 2018  it expects to open 38 to 43 restaurants globally  which will include new markets like Panama  Chile and Vietnam 
Meanwhile  in third quarter fiscal 2018  Brinker s global business partners in Latin America and the Pacific witnessed positive comps  indicating strong demand for the brand worldwide  Currently  the company is under negotiation to expand its footprint in China 
Brinker is also investing heavily in technology driven initiatives  like online ordering  to augment sales and boost guest services  This is because the digital wave has hit the U S  fast casual restaurant sector  with many restaurants deploying technology toward enhancing guest experience 
Having installed a table top technology at all the company owned restaurants in partnership with Ziosk  Brinker has now implemented handheld devices across California  This  in turn  is resulting in increased efficiency and speed 

 
Concerns
Higher labor costs owing to increased wages and costs incurred due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue weighing on profits  Moreover  the collapse of the Republican led bill  which was intended to replace Obamacare  indicates that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay  This means that the restaurant operators will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs  which in turn will hurt margins 
Additionally  costs related to various sales boosting initiatives including advertising expenses along with commodity inflation are expected to continue hurting margins  Thus  the company s profits in the upcoming quarters might remain under pressure despite its cost saving initiatives  In fiscal 2018  Brinker expects restaurant operating margin to be down 65 75 basis points as it invests specifically in its core food equities 
In the coming quarters  Brinker s international comps are also likely to be affected by a slowdown in some of the markets that it operates in  Moreover  the company is highly exposed to threats from various emerging nations  which has been exhibiting decelerating growth for some time due to several macro headwinds 
This  in turn  might limit discretionary spending and hurt the company s top line  For instance  Brinker s business in the Middle East is widely challenged  given the adverse economic factors impacting the region

8496,230011,BJRI,5 Top Stocks To Make The Most Of Blockbuster Jobs Report,opinion,"Job additions topped forecasts in October  with unemployment rate at a 48 year low  American workers enjoyed the biggest rise in pay since 2009 
Robust jobs data  thus  painted a pretty picture of the U S  economy  Let us  thus  look at stocks that can make the most of the blockbuster jobs report and scale north 
Here s Proof the Labor Market is on Fire
The U S  economy continues to be one of the world s most powerful employment generating machines  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the economy added 250 000 new jobs in October  exceeding analysts  estimates of around 188 000  Nonfarm payrolls  in fact  rose average 213 000 through the first 10 months of this year  way higher than 182 000 in the same period last year 
Such a feat was achieved despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor  headwinds associated with slowdown in cyclical part of the economy  including housing  and distortions from hurricanes 
By the way  the jobless rate ticked down to 3 7   the lowest since 1969  The real unemployment rate  including those who are underemployed and discouraged  also known as the U6 rate  contracted to 7 4   which is slightly less than last s month s estimate of 7 5   The U6 now stands at a level lower than it was during the 2007 2009 recession 

 
 Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics More Jobs Lure People In to Labor Force  Staffing to ShineSuch a strong month of hiring has led to the labor force participation rate increasing to 62 9  from 62 7  the prior month  This surely bodes well for staffing companies  Additionally  the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index was 110 77 in September  Compared to the year ago level  the index shows a jump of 6 7  Gad Levanon  chief economist  North America  at the Conference Board had said that  the index remains on a solid upward trend and demand for workers is likely to continue growing rapidly in the coming quarters  The buoyancy in the staffing space is further confirmed by its solid  in the top 23   indicating continued hiring and more job opportunities  In fact  the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Leisure and Hospitality Lead the Way in HiringBy and large  the jobs report showed that most of the industries added jobs and workers  pay have risen at a better than expected pace  Construction firms boosted payrolls by 30 000 and manufacturers took on 32 000 workers  Healthcare and education taken together  in fact  witnessed the highest job growth in October However  it was the leisure and hospitality sector that singlehandedly led the way in hiring by increasing employment by 42 000  Such a hiring spree indicated that those who are into the arts and entertainment  hotels and food businesses are in an expansion mode and their businesses are churning out huge profits Record Wage Growth to Boost Consumer Discretionary SpendingThe phenomenal jobs report also shows that hourly pay went up 0 2  to  27 30 last month  In the last 12 months  wages rose to 3 1  from 2 8   touching 3  for the first time since the end of the Great Recession

Courtesy of record wage growth  the consumer discretionary sector is  thus  poised to benefit significantly  After all  higher wage growth plays a significant role in driving consumer discretionary spending  Needless to say  among the economic factors that mostly affect demand for consumer discretionary goods is wage growth  If wages keep rising  consumers generally have more discretionary income to spend  In contrast  if wages fall or remain stagnant  demand for such goods decline 
Jobs Report Points to Higher Interest Rates  Banks Gain
Higher pay means that the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses is going to go up soon  Higher inflation  in turn  may lead to increased interest rates 
Minutes from the U S  Federal Reserve s September meeting had already confirmed that the central bank is most likely to continue hiking benchmark lending rates at a gradual pace this year and beyond  Majority of the Fed policymakers said that rate hikes  would most likely be consistent  with economic expansion  strength in labor market and the current period of firming inflation 
As the stage for gradual rate hikes is set  institutions such as banks will see a ramp up in profits  Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities

From recruiters and leisure and hospitality to consumer discretionary players and banks  all stand to gain from a strong jobs report  Thus  investing in such stocks seems the right thing to do now  We have picked five such stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

The company has been undertaking various sales building initiatives that are expected to have reflected in the to be reported quarter s top line  Additionally  vigorous cost containment initiatives are expected to have aided earnings in the first quarter  Despite bearing the brunt of soft consumer demand and pressurized sales in the past few quarters  the company s efforts to serve distinguished menu to customers and enhancement of digital capabilities have marked a turnaround Also  in a year s time  BJ Restaurants  shares have rallied 14 1  outperforming the  s gain of 6 7  Let s take a look at how the company s revenues and earnings will shape up in the to be reported quarter Several Initiatives to Aid Top LineBJ s Restaurants has implemented several major sales building initiatives in 2017 that have been tested and are expected to have contributed positively in the first quarter  In 2017  the restaurant crew mastered advanced cooking methods and also became skillful in taking orders from the recently installed hand held ordering tablets  Also  the company s slow roasted menu launch has become a huge success Notably  off premise sales increased to 7  of the company s revenues in the last reported quarter compared with its industry average of nearly 10 11   Given the fact that off premise sales represent a considerable revenue growth opportunity  the company has been undertaking various efforts to enhance delivery and take out services  In fact  it intends to leverage its highly rated mobile app and website  along with new third party delivery partners to drive growth in off premise sales  The company currently has delivery available in about 149 restaurants  with another 23 scheduled to be added by the end of the first quarter Also  BJ s has also developed a deep pipeline of new menu items  focusing on its EnLIGHTened menu category  featuring its new super food options  Moreover  the company expects to offset some of the labor pressure through prudent menu pricing and design  Additionally  its promotional offers along with bundled lunch offerings should boost sales and drive guest traffic  Additionally  the restaurant has undertaken several digital initiatives to improve the speed of service  and thereby enhance guest experience and profitability Owing to these sales building efforts  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is pegged at  274 03 million  reflecting 6 3  year over year growth Cost Cutting Efforts to Drive EarningsAlthough high costs are prevalent in the restaurant space  various cost savings and efficiency initiatives of the company are expected to have aided margins and thereby earnings in the first quarter  The consensus estimate for the quarter s earnings is pegged at 54 cents per share  suggesting 28 6  growth from the prior year quarter The company is committed to improve its operating margins through cost containment initiatives  Notably  BJ s Restaurants is focusing more on its smaller prototype restaurants that cost roughly  1 million less than the prior prototype  This helps in reducing operating costs  Due to lesser food wastage and improved labor productivity  these new restaurants generate higher margins  Moreover  in 2017  the company initiated an additional  5 million of efficiency savings in areas such as sourcing  distribution  supplies and maintenance Also  gauging the high cost infested restaurant operating environment  it has decided to put off new openings for some time  and focus even more on its enterprise resources and build sales instead  This may turn out to be favorable as it would provide some margin momentum Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatBJ s Restaurants does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a

8514,230029,BJRI,BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  Opens Sixth Outlet In Maryland,opinion,"BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   recently announced the launch of its sixth restaurant in Maryland  Located in Hagerstown  the restaurant seats roughly 230 guests and features wide ranging menu  Notably  this is the second unit opening in 2018 and the company also has plans to open its third outlet in June at Albany 
Notably  for quite some time now  BJ s Restaurants is trying to fend off competition and a difficult sales environment by focusing more on sales building initiatives  To this end  the company had decided to put off new openings for some time but did not completely refrain from it  as a slowdown in unit growth can potentially dent the restaurant s sales 
Slowdown in Unit Growth to Aid Margins but Dent Revenues
After reducing the number of restaurant openings to 10 in fiscal 2017 compared with 17 in fiscal 2016  the company plans to open just four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018  The reduction in new openings is due to the company s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives 
We believe that this particular strategy of slowing down its unit growth may turn out to be favorable for the company  as it would provide some margin momentum and maximize its free cash flow  These when combined with the company s conservative balance sheet would provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases  going forward 
However  the slowdown in the company s development plan might somewhat dent its sales growth  As it is  the company s expanse in the global market is limited  While several other restaurant bigwigs like Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Domino s   NYSE DPZ   are capitalizing on the emerging market potential  BJ s Restaurants seems to be slow on this front  We believe that the company needs to spread its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cutthroat competition in the saturated domestic market 
What s the Key Growth Driver 
BJ s Restaurants implemented several major sales building initiatives that have contributed positively to the company s first quarter sales  With increased focus on productivity and efficiency  along with a plan of balanced restaurant opening  the company is further heading toward near and long term operating success 
The company s key needle moving initiatives continued to drive substantial revenues in the first quarter of 2018  In 2017  the restaurant crew mastered advanced cooking methods and also became skillful in taking orders via hand held ordering tablets  In fact  results from these initiatives have been positive so far 
Notably  in the fourth quarter of 2017  off premise sales increased to 7  of the company s revenues compared with its industry average of nearly 10 11   Further  in the first quarter of 2018  BJ s Restaurants  off premise business grew more than 30   constituting 7 5  of the company s revenues and is 150 basis points  bps  higher than the prior year quarter  Looking at this trend  management believes that there is a tremendous opportunity for further building the off premise part of business 
Meanwhile  BJ s Restaurants  extensive focus on refining and streamlining its menu is the key driver for improved traffic  The company s slow roasted menu  launched in 2017  has become a huge success  It has significantly boosted average check  with high incident rates 
Owing to such efforts  BJ s Restaurants  shares have returned 13 7  over the past year  outpacing the  s rally of 1 5  
The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

8518,230033,BJRI,5 Mid Cap Stocks To Tackle Trade War   Overvaluation Fears,opinion,"Mid caps are an often overlooked investing option  These securities are viewed as big and safe compared to the highly volatile small cap exposure  But when compared to the stability of large caps  these are relatively risky bets  However  investors ignoring this key segment of the investing spectrum should note that the present development in the global economy makes the way clear for mid cap investing 
Why to Stay Away from Large Caps
Notably  large caps have wider foreign exposure and thus any negative development pertaining to the global economy does not bode well for this category  This section is fraught with risks emanating from ongoing trade tensions  likely strength in the greenback and a slowdown in several foreign economies 
Trade tension between China and the United States has escalated of late with China levying tariffs on a variety of U S  goods  including crude and gasoline  as a retaliation to President Donald Trump s  levy on Chinese imports 
If this was not enough  in the latest G 7 summit  Trump criticized allies  mainly Canada s prime minister Trudeau  which gives cues of the trade conflict even with the G 7 cronies  Worries over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  also flared up 
On the other hand  several developed economies  including the Eurozone  have been slowing down  The Eurozone economy expanded  sequentially in the first quarter of 2018  following a 0 7  rise in the previous period  Canada s first quarter GDP marked the slowest expansion since a 0 3  shrinkage in the second quarter of 2016  Meanwhile  the British economy expanded 0 1  sequentially in the quarter  representing the lowest growth since a 0 1  contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012 
This sudden slowdown in foreign economies might make some investors cautious about large cap stocks because of their higher foreign exposure  Prospects of a stronger dollar  given a hawkish Fed  may also hurt such stocks 
How Long Will the Small Cap Rally Last 
Meanwhile  the U S  economy has been on the steady ground  This boosted small cap equities  which are mostly domestic focused   Apart from this  insulation from trade tensions and upbeat earnings sent small caps rallying in recent times 
But at   small cap stocks are pricier than the bigger counterparts in the S P  which has an expected P E ratio of 17 5x  per Bloomberg  The difference of 2 84 times has increased from 2 16 at the end of March  So  the overvaluation of smaller caps is concerning 
Reasons for Mid Cap Investing
All in all  the situation is not favorable for small or large caps  Thus  it is advisable to take a middle of the road approach and gain exposure to a space that offers best of both worlds  In this regard  we highlight a few mid cap stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   a market cap between  1 billion to  5 billion and a year to date price increase of more than 50

8541,230056,BJRI,Small Business Sentiment Second Best In 45 Years  5 Picks,opinion,On Mar 13  the National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  released data for its small cap business optimism index  which rose to its second highest level in February since its inception 45 years ago  Trump administration s tax overhaul policies and strengthening domestic economy supported these gains Small cap stocks are believed to have a higher level of volatility compared to their large and mid cap counterparts but provide comparatively better returns  Moreover  recent trade war uncertainty makes these largely domestically focused stocks a strong investment option  Also  small cap stocks will show greater growth potential following strong business optimism and a weak tax environment  which makes them great picks at this point Small Business Sentiment Index Hovers Near Record HighThe NFIB small business optimism index increased 0 7 points to 107 6 in February  Out of the 10 major components in the index  seven registered an increase Meanwhile  the three key components of the index  expectation of higher sales prospects  improving economy and strong inventory rose 3   2  and 2   respectively  Inventory investment was best since 2000  while earnings trends were strongest since 1987  Also  capital outlays were the biggest since 2004 NFIB President Juanita Duggan said  the historically high readings  highlighted that Trump s new steel and aluminum tariffs and lower taxes will play a  transformative  role for small businesses  Additionally  NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said small business are thriving in ways which have not been witnessed in more than  a decade  Trump s Economic Policies in FocusAfter weeks of market jitters  Trump finally signed the tariff plan into law on Mar 8  slapping tariffs of 25  on steel imports and 10  on aluminum imports from other countries  It will come into effect within 15 days  However  Canada and Mexico were exempted from these new U S  tariffs    Moreover  Trump s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries with similar kind of moves  Investors have been concerned about prospects of a trade war  Fears of this nature could actually benefit small cap companies  which have limited exposure to the global market compared to their mid  and large cap counterparts Additionally  last year  the much awaited Tax Bill was finally signed by President Trump in the Oval office  The Tax Bill  now known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35  to 21   Additionally  on Mar 13  the President while talking to U S  Representative for Texas  Kevin Brady raised expectations for  additional tax cuts  as he said that he wishes for a  phase two  in tax cuts Before the tax cut  companies on the small cap index Russell 2000 had to pay a median effective tax rate of 31 9  while the larger  multi national companies on the S P 500 pay a median effective tax rate of 28   according to Thomson Reuters data  This is why Trump s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is expected to benefit small cap stocks to a great extent Our ChoicesStrong business sentiment  Trump s pro growth economic policies  stronger domestic economy and upbeat jobs report bode well for small cap stocks  Moreover  possibility of a trade war between major countries following Trump s new tariff laws makes small cap stocks a wise investment choice Given this backdrop  it makes sense to bet on small cap stocks  which are included in the Russell 2000

8544,230059,BJRI,4 Stocks To Serve Better Returns Amid Restaurant Recovery,opinion,After surviving the seven quarter long tragedy of declining comps  the U S  restaurant industry received a pleasant surprise in the fourth quarter of 2017  According to TDn2K s The Restaurant Industry Snapshot  comps for the fourth quarter were up 0 4   comparing favorably with the third quarter s comps decline of 1  Should We Be Optimistic of Growth The positive momentum in sales growth in the fourth quarter was not enough to outweigh the sluggish growth of the industry in 2017  For the full year  comps declined 1 1   the same as in 2016  Traffic for the year also fell 3 2  Amid declining traffic trends for the year  comps growth may have been aided by promotions and discounting strategies by restaurant managements  Over the past year  the restaurant  s shares have returned 14 9   underperforming the growth of 16 2  for the S P 500 However  most of the restaurants are undertaking aggressive sales building strategies to drive demand  The fourth quarter already bore the fruit of these efforts  We believe that 2018 is set to witness an overall improvement in restaurant sales given an increase in consumer discretionary spending coupled with the restaurant bigwig s sales improvement efforts Restaurant Operators Bullish About Industry ScenarioA turnover for most restaurants showed up in November 2017 and is ongoing  Moreover  according to TDn2K market research  the overall restaurant industry is starting to improve  Although not all brands may have an opportunity to rake

8545,230060,BJRI,4 Retail Stocks To Buy Despite Soft February Sales,opinion,U S  retail sales remained soft in the month of February per the recent data released by the United States Commerce Department  reflecting a decline of 0 1   way behind the consensus expectation of 0 4  growth  January data  however  was revised upward to show sales dipping 0 1  instead of decline of 0 3  as previously reported  It marked three months of decline in a row  since April 2012   Among the various components of the retail sales  vehicles sales declined 0 9  in February  according to the monthly report  Furthermore  furniture sales  health care and personal care sales  declined 0 8  and 0 4   respectively  Sales at gasoline stores were down 1 2  and food sales decreased 0 1  However  the month s bright spots were a 1 9  increase in building materials against a decline of 1 7  in January and 0 2  restaurant sales growth from a 0 1  gain the previous month  Also  sales at non store retailers jumped 1  after a sharp fall in January Is There a Cause for Concern Following the data release  J P  Morgan cut its first quarter 2018 GDP forecast from 2 5  to 2   while Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  reduced the same to 1 8  from 2   The Atlanta Fed s GDP estimate fell to 1 9   down from 2 5  Given that retail sales for the first two months of the first quarter were not so strong  its contribution to the quarter s GDP should be below than last quarter and weigh on economic growth  In the fourth quarter  the economy grew 2 5   but expectations are growth of 3  per the third revision which is due later this month However  looking further  core retail sales  which exclude sales related to vehicles  gasoline  building materials and food services and more closely indicate GDP trends   inched up 0 1  after remaining unchanged in the month of January  The number was  however  lower than the consensus estimate of a 0 5  gain  Also  the monthly report states that retail sales increased 4  year over year  provided some breather Economists believe that an increase in spending on services should buoy first quarter retail sales results and there is the likelihood of strong service spending given solid recent data Strong Service Sector GrowthInstitute for Supply Management  ISM  data for the month of February showed that the non manufacturing index  NMI  was 59 5  topping analysts  estimates of 58 4  This was also more than an average of 57 for all of 2017  NMI reading above 49  indicates an expansion for the broader economy The non manufacturing index saw uninterrupted expansion for the 97th consecutive month and indicated that the broader economy is on track for steady growth this year  Expansion was witnessed in sectors related to education services  transportation and warehousing  utilities  real estate  finance   insurance  healthcare  construction  mining  retail trade  agriculture and information  Service spending trends thus look rosier  which should aid U S  retail sales in the first quarter of 2018   Alongside  the environment for the retail sector remains favorable against the backdrop of economic strength underpinned by gradual wage acceleration  a 17 year low unemployment rate and rising consumer confidence  and a reduction in tax rate   The  sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has put up a good show by advancing roughly 10 7  in the last three months  comfortably outperforming the S P 500 s growth of approximately 3 1  Top 4 PicksGiven the prospective growth of retail sales  investors may consider buying sound stocks from this space  We have  thus  selected four stocks that should be accretive  to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Our search was also narrowed down with a

8559,230074,BJRI,Should Value Investors Consider BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BJ s Restaurants has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 33  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 62  If we focus on the long term PE trend  BJ s Restaurants  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that BJ s Restaurants has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 18 75  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  BJ s Restaurants has a P S ratio of about 0 80  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 36 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  BJRI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  BJ s Restaurants currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BJ s Restaurants a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for BJ s Restaurants is just 1 29  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 13  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio comes in at 7 37  which is lower than the industry average of 12 16  Clearly  BJRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall    Though BJ s Restaurants might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives BJRI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen one downward revision compared to two upward in the same time period      This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1 4  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched up by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BJ s Restaurants  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  BJ s Restaurants is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 38  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2019-07-14,Zacks Investment

8571,230086,BJRI,Yum  Brands  YUM  Gains From Refranchising  High Costs Rife,opinion,"Yum  Brands    NYSE YUM   robust efforts to enhance digital capabilities  refranchising attempts and transformation strategies continue to be encouraging  However  higher costs continue to hurt the company s profits  Also  macroeconomic headwinds and unfavorable currency translation might limit the company s revenue growth 
Last month  Yum  Brands reported   beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings but missing the same on revenues Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents  Further  earnings increased 21 5  year over year  The shift to refranchising substantially boosted the company s operating margin and earnings per share  and the trend is expected to continue 
Notably  the company s shares have gained 22 2  in the past year  outperforming the  s gain of 11 7  
Let s look into the strengths and risks associated with the company 
Digital Initiatives Drive Top Line Growth
Yum  Brands had undertaken a three year strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands that involve employing greater focus on the development ofits three iconic global brands  To build traffic through greater consumer satisfaction  the company is continuously developing digital and technological capabilities 
Advanced technological implementations to improve guest experience are also proving to be fruitful for the company s international business  Yum  Brands believes in maximizing consumer satisfaction to drive revenues 
To this end the company is focusing on building a superlative loyalty program with a large and growing database to help drive future sales  We believe that these initiatives will drive traffic and comps in the coming quarters 
In fourth quarter 2017  Yum  Brands announced a partnership with online food delivery platform Grubhub to enhance online sales and delivery from its restaurants  Additionally  the company implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms in the fourth quarter across all its brand segments to improve guest experience  To enhance its delivery services  the company announced Pizza Hut s partnership with Toyota that will facilitate delivery of pizzas via driverless vehicles  showcasing innovation for both the companies 
Refranchising Aids Earnings
Yum  Brands has adopted a de risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising  In fourth quarter 2017  the company increased its franchise ownership to 97   It is committed toward becoming at least 98  franchised and to possess less than 1 000 company owned restaurants by the end of 2018 
Refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and higher Return on Equity  ROE   Alongside  free cash flow will continue to grow  facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return  Remarkably  this shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company s operating margin over the years  
High Costs   Unfavorable Currency as Potential Headwinds
Due to continual expansion in international markets  the company is highly exposed to various macroeconomic headwinds  Thus  the company s earnings remain highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates 
Also  an increase in the cost of employee wages  benefits and insurance  as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs have led to a significant pressure on the company s margins   A competitive retail environment also puts pressure on the restaurants  costs 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Yum  Brands carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A few better ranked stocks in the U S  restaurant space include BJ s Restaurants   NASDAQ BJRI    Brinker International   NYSE EAT   and Darden Restaurants   NYSE DRI    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
BJ s  Brinker and Darden s earnings for 2018 are expected to increase 27   6 6  and 18 4   respectively

8593,230108,BJRI,SBUX Vs  YUM  Which Stock Is Poised For Better Q3 Earnings ,opinion,We are in the thick of the Q3 earnings season with results seemingly on solid ground given the positive momentum on the revenue front  Apart from maintaining the above average proportion of positive earnings surprises  the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is quite palpable According to our latest   64 2  of the total market capitalization of S P 500 is already out  As of Oct 27  2017  total earnings for the 272 S P 500 members are up 8 7  year over year on 6 7  higher revenues  Of these  75 7  surpassed earnings estimates  while 66 2  beat revenue expectations A Look at the Restaurant IndustryWe note that the performance of the restaurant industry  under the broader Retail Wholesale sector  has been mixed so far this earnings season  Among the restaurant stocks that have reported  Domino s Pizza Inc    NYSE DPZ   posted robust results  beating earnings and revenue estimates McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   posted mixed third quarter 2017 results  While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues fell short of the same  However  Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc    NYSE CMG   lagged on both fronts Soft consumer spending environment in the U S  restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains  Also  the recent hurricanes seem to have negatively impacted results of a number of restaurant companies this earnings season  which includes the likes of BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI      that reported lower than expected results in third quarter fiscal 2017 Nonetheless  innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not so favorable environment Let s have a sneak peek at two major restaurant stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping before the announcement Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results We expect Starbucks  revenues to increase on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth  Starbucks also projected global comps growth at 3 4  for the quarter  Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes  Seared Steak and Egg Wrap Starbucks  digital offering  Mobile Order and Pay  is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to be reported quarter as well as in 2017  Again  growth in Starbucks reward members is expected to contribute to its revenue growth in the to be reported quarter The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year  driven by mid single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States  Overall  for the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  5 73 billion  implying 0 4  year over year growth With respect to the company s bottom line  Starbucks  EPS is likely to witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores  Hence  despite a revenue growth expectation  the coffee giant s margins are likely to narrow due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation  These headwinds  however  are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative  G A  expenses That said  a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term For the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share  reflecting a decrease of 2 5  year over year Meanwhile  our proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components For the impending quarter  the company has an  of  0 08   Starbucks currently has Zacks Rank  3  Hold   making an earnings prediction uncertain  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy

opening bell Post China business separation  Yum  Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands  increasing its franchise ownership  and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure bodes well  This  in turn  is likely to bolster third quarter results Particularly  augmented pace of unit development along with increased investments in technology driven initiatives is anticipated to somewhat drive top line growth in the quarter Coming to the Pizza Hut brand  while the international division might continue doing well  Pizza Hut U S  is expected to post soft results for the quarter despite numerous strategic efforts similar to the last few quarters  Notably  a soft consumer spending environment in the U S  restaurant space is likely to continue restricting revenue growth Meanwhile  KFC s efforts to revamp outlets  focus on its operational excellence  delivery services  innovation and convenience  are expected to continue boosting comps However  Yum  Brands is likely to witness a decline in company sales due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative  which  in turn  will lower the company s revenues in the third quarter  A slowdown in emerging markets is likely to further hamper the quarter s performance Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings of 66 cents implies a year over year decline of 39 5   The same for revenues is pegged at  1 39 billion  58 2  lower than the prior year quarter figure Meanwhile  our proven model does not conclusively show that Yum  Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components  For the impending quarter  the company has an Earnings ESP of  1 37   The company currently has

And on Tuesday  local officials have begun urging residents in Florida to evacuate  with Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos A  Gimenez saying at a news briefing  This hurricane is far too powerful  poses far too great a threat for us to delay actions any further  
As Harvey impacted numerous industries here in the U S   Irma is already doing the same  Shares of cruise line companies  for instance  are already getting slammed  while restaurants that have a large presence in Florida are seeing their stocks plummet as well

The Fiesta Restaurant Group owns  operates  and franchises fast casual restaurants  It operates its fast casual restaurants under the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brand names  The company s Pollo Tropical restaurants offer various Caribbean inspired food  and Taco Cabana restaurants offer a selection of Mexican food  As of January 1  2017  it had 177 company owned Pollo Tropical restaurants  166 company owned Taco Cabana restaurants  and 29 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in the United States and abroad  The company was incorporated in 2011 and is headquartered in Dallas  Texas

Potential Reasons For Insider Buying
We define fundamental metrics and present charts below that may help explain why insiders are buying shares EBITDA is defined as Earnings before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation  and Amortization  It is a commonly used metric in valuation as a proxy for operating profitability because it provides a cleaner picture of overall profitability  especially when benchmarking against comparable companies  This is because it ignores non operating costs that can be affected by certain items such as a company s financing decisions or political jurisdictions 
Projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR is the average annual growth rate of EBITDA over a five year period  It s calculated as follows  5yr CAGR     EBITDA FY 5   EBITDA FY      1 5 years    1  The chart below plots the five year EBITDA compounded annual growth rate for Fiesta Restaurant Group and its peers 
source  finbox ioGoing forward  analysts forecast that Fiesta Restaurant Group  s EBITDA will reach  85 million by fiscal year 2021 representing a five year CAGR of 6 9   The company s projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR is slightly below LOCO  8 4   and well above BH   2 1    BJRI  2 9   and BOJA  3 3   
Typically  companies expected to grow at a higher rate relative to their peers will also trade at higher valuation multiples  However  Fiesta Restaurant Group s forward EBITDA multiple of 6 3x is only above BH  5 7x  and below BJRI  6 4x   BOJA  8 2x  and LOCO  8 1x  as illustrated below 
source  finbox ioThe fundamental charts above indicate that the company s stock may be trading at a discount while insiders are likely adding shares while the company s valuation is relatively low compared to its peer group  Value investors may want to look further into Fiesta Restaurant Group ",2017-09-12,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-insiders-continue-to-buy-fiesta-restaurant-group-200212880,200212880

Moreover  the company has been reporting positive same store sales domestically and internationally for the past 25 and 94 consecutive quarters  respectively  Going forward  the company s initiatives on the digital front  focus on re imaging and other sales boosting strategies are expected to help sustain the excellent comps trend and drive growth   
Growth Drivers
Domino s continues to boost sales through regular limited time offers  Also  the company s remodeling initiative is anticipated to continue enhancing its potential as a brand and augment guest experience  The recent launch of bread twists is also expected to favorably impact the company s performance third quarter 2017 onwards 
Meanwhile  Domino s world class digital ordering platforms like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Home  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Messenger  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Echo  Twitter and ordering via a Pizza emoji on text should further continue to increase digital orders  Notably  the extended ways to order a pizza has kept it in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience 
The company is also working toward reducing its ownership of restaurants and is focusing more on re franchising as it minimizes capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth as well as ROE expansion Markedly  Domino s recently completed recapitalization deal also makes cash available for potential special dividend and share repurchases  depending upon the board s approval 
Apart from these initiatives  Domino s commitment to expand presence in the high growth international market to boost its business bode well  The company s international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets  driven by exceptional unit level economics 
Potential Headwinds
Though the company s sales building efforts are impressive and should offer long term advantages  costs related to the same could continue hurting margins in the near term  Also  higher labor costs might pressurize the margins 
Furthermore  given its sizeable international operations  Domino s is exposed to risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact the results of the company 
Also  a challenging industry backdrop remains a potent cause of concern for some restaurant chains like The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE    BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI    Jack in the Box  Inc    NASDAQ JACK   and others  Though pizza giants such as Domino s have been comparatively faring well so far  the continued slowdown in the industry at large might hamper their prospects  going forward

Regardless of certain headwinds  Domino s operational advantages  given its market share and scale  along with insistent focus on innovation and execution of growth strategy are anticipated to aid the stock in maintaining its solid performance

8625,230140,BJRI,7 Restaurant Stocks To Avoid Amid Industry Woes   Harvey Blows,opinion,"Hurricane Harvey s devastation has ranged far and wide  with heavy rainfall and flooding continuing to hit parts of Texas   particularly Houston   and Louisiana 
Houston is the fourth most populous city in the United States and represents about 2  of the country s total restaurant presence  In fact  according to the country s official website  Houston residents are more likely to eat out than any other city in the country 
Notably  the impact of the storm on restaurant sales could last for a long period now  depending on the severity of property damage  As outlets remain closed for repairs  workers are displaced  or residents focus their funds on rebuilding their homes  restaurant sales will largely suffer 
Per a Canaccord analyst  as reported in a CNBC article   In some cases  we think the lingering effects will carry well into September and likely into Q4  
Harvey Adds to the Already Soft Industry Backdrop
Over the last few quarters  the U S  restaurants space has not been too enticing for investors  Despite economic growth  somewhat lower energy prices and higher income  consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out  which resulted in low consumption  This is because along with wage growth inflation is also on the rise  which translates to lower real income and thus less disposable income 
Moreover  as consumers demand high quality products at lower prices  it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive  This  in turn  is resulting in a bigger gap between food at home and food away from home indices 
Consequently  same store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment  Traffic too has been weak  In fact  the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative same store sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  thereby continuing the somber mood 
Thus  the Zacks  industry ranks in the Bottom 9  out of more than 250 industries  The industry has also underperformed the broader S P 500 market in the last year  recording a growth of 5 8  while the market grew more than 13 5  
Moreover  while the industry delivered an EPS growth of negative 2 27  year over year in second quarter 2017  the same is projected to increase 3 9  in the current quarter  once again less than S P 500 market s projected growth of 9 6  

Stocks You Should Avoid Right Now
The combination of these above mentioned factors is likely to spell trouble for the restaurant stocks listed below 
Jack in the Box  Inc    NASDAQ JACK   has 70  of its restaurants in the Texas and California markets and thus is highly prone to damages from Harvey along with ongoing macro woes  The company has witnessed its Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter and current year earnings revise downward by 7 1  and 3 6   respectively  over the past month  While analysts were already pessimistic about the stock s prospects  the recent storm could make it worse  Currently  the company has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
About 41  of Chuy s Holdings  Inc  s   NASDAQ CHUY   restaurants are located in Texas  thus exposing it largely to the region s conditions  The stock has seen current quarter and current year earnings estimates revise downward by 14 3  and 4 6   respectively  over the past month  It currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
As Buffalo Wild Wings  Inc    NASDAQ BWLD   continues to grapple with rising chicken wing costs coupled with higher promotional activity and a soft consumer spending environment  Harvey adds to its list of woes  With around 100 stores around Texas  about 9  of its total system   the stock s near term prospects look bleak  As it is  analysts have revised the stock s current quarter and current year earnings downward by 32 5  and 16 1   respectively  over the past two months  Also  the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  5 
Sonic Corp    NASDAQ SONC   is another Zacks Rank  4 company with about 50 locations in Houston itself and more than 960 drive ins around Texas  Per the company s fiscal third quarter conference call  management had already lowered Sonic s same store sales expectation to a negative 2 5  in fiscal 2017 and expects its adjusted EPS to decline in the range of 2 5   Harvey is expected to make matters even worse  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year projects a sales decline of 20 9  from the prior year 
The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE   has nearly 9  of its system exposed to Texas markets and that intensifies its already prevailing problems  The company recently slashed its EPS and comps guidance outlook for fiscal 2017  keeping in mind its low traffic trend  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter and current year earnings have also lowered 12 9  and 7 3   respectively  over the past two months  Cheesecake Factory currently carries a Zacks Rank of 5 
BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   is another Zacks Rank  5 company with about 18  of its restaurants in Texas  The company already planned to slow down its unit openings in 2017  which is expected to dent sales growth  Moreover  BJRI s current quarter and current year estimates have moved down 7 1  and 11 1   respectively  over the past two months 
Brinker International  Inc  s   NYSE EAT   international comps have already been under pressure due to a slowdown in some of the markets it operates in  The situation at domestic lands has been tight too due to a challenging retail environment in the restaurants space  Now  the company s huge exposure to Texas markets is expected further weigh on its performance  Brinker has a Zacks Rank  4 and its current quarter and current year earnings estimates have moved down 10  and 2 5   respectively  over the past two months 
You can see  
Bottom Line
The amalgamation of consumer spending uncertainty on dining out  Harvey s aftermath and increased labor expenses due to Obamacare is expected to pressurize the restaurant industry in general and the aforementioned stocks in particular 
Although by implementing the right strategies the companies can overcome these hurdles to some extent  it would be prudent for investors to steer clear of these as of now

8626,230141,BJRI,Pizza Hut expanding beer delivery test in Arizona and California,news,"LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Yum Brands Inc s  N YUM  Pizza Hut chain is expanding a beer delivery test to nearly 100 restaurants in Arizona and California this month as industry leaders vie for market share in the face of sluggish growth 
Operators are seeking creative ways to boost sales as restaurant traffic growth has been weak to flat for several years due to competition ranging from grocery stores that sell prepared food to a proliferation of meal kit companies 
Pizza Hut started its beer delivery project in downtown Phoenix in December as part of a larger push to set the chain apart from rivals like Domino s Pizza Inc  N DPZ  
Domino s does not deliver alcohol  but it recently added 150 000 new delivery  hotspots  at U S  parks  beaches and other destinations that do not have traditional addresses in a bid find new business 
The enlarged Pizza Hut test will include Arizona cities such as Tucson  Prescott and Winslow  California cities include Los Angeles  Bakersfield  Sacramento and Santa Barbara 
More than 1 700 of Pizza Hut s roughly 6 300 U S  units have liquor licenses  giving the chain a potential lead over some rivals 
 Many Pizza Hut restaurants are already licensed to serve and distribute beer  without third party services  additional fees  or extended wait times   Pizza Hut Chief Marketing Officer Zipporah Allen told Reuters 
Pizza Hut s beer delivery drivers will be at least 21 years old and trained in local alcohol laws  the company said  They have the authority to cancel a beer delivery order if customers cannot verify they are old enough to legally consume alcohol 
Pizza Hut s announcement landed hours after privately held Panera Bread  NASDAQ PNRA  Co said it had completed the national roll out of its own food delivery service to 897 cities 
While pizza chains and Panera do their own delivery  many other restaurants farm the work out to companies that take a slice of revenue 
Strategy firm Pentallect Inc has forecast that U S  third party food delivery industry sales will grow from  13 billion in 2017 to  24 5 billion by 2022 
Pizza Hut parent Yum  which also owns the Taco Bell and KFC brands  earlier this year spent  200 million to buy a 3 percent stake in food delivery company GrubHub Inc  N GRUB  
McDonald s Corp  N MCD  partners with UberEats for fast food delivery in the United States

weak  In fact  the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  thereby continuing the somber mood  BJ s Restaurants is no exception to the trend and resultantly  the company s sales have also come under pressure Slowdown in OpeningsIt is to be noted that BJ s Restaurants has reduced the number of planned restaurant openings to 10 in 2017 compared with 17 in the last year  The reduction came on the back of the company s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives  However  the slowdown in company s 2017 development plan may dent sales growth Rising Costs Putting Pressure on MarginsHigher cost of sales and labor costs due to higher wages are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure  Also  costs incurred owing to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act would dampen profits Moreover  pre opening costs  higher marketing expenses as well as costs related to sales boosting initiatives might further pressurize margins  Particularly  additional training on slow roasting ovens and handheld tablets will add to the labor costs Meanwhile  BJ s Restaurants has recorded trailing 12 month net margin of just 3 8  compared with the industry average of 15 1   Given the continual rise in expenses  the trend is not expected to reverse for the company any time soon Stocks to ConsiderA few better ranked stocks in this sector are Papa John s International  Inc    NASDAQ PZZA    Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE

8655,230170,BJRI,Is BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  A Suitable Value Pick At The Moment ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BJ s Restaurants has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20 49  This level compares similarly with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 48 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts BJ s Restaurants  current PE near its lows  The current PE is well below its median for the term  which stands at 29 74   and the number has been on a general downtrend since its peak in 2014  Hence  we could infer that the stock is undervalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend  Thus  the present level seems to be a suitable entry point for the stock from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Restaurants industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 17  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that BJ s Restaurants has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 22 07  higher than the current figure  Delving deeper into the PE s inputs we observed that the company s earnings are expected to see a slight dip this year  which would serve to inflate the PE ratio  A soft consumer spending environment in the U S  restaurant space has been hurting BJ s Restaurants comps growth and putting sales under pressure  In fact  most restaurateurs have been experiencing a similar fate  However  earnings are expected to stabilize 2018 onwards  PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BJ s Restaurants has a P S ratio of about 0 83  This is significantly lower than the Zacks categorized Retail   Restaurants industry average  which comes in at 3 63 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years This clearly suggests some level of undervalued trading for BJRI at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BJ s Restaurants currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BJ s Restaurants a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for BJ s Restaurants is just 1 25  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 77  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 33  which is far better than the industry average of 9 80  Clearly  BJRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though BJ s Restaurants might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives BJRI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  BJ s Restaurants seems to have pretty striking prospects Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had just a small but meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 5 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has moved higher by 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BJ s Restaurants  Inc  Price and Consensus   The combination of these somewhat mixed factors is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBJ s Restaurants is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Although boasting of a strong industry rank  Top 39  out of more than 250 industries   the company s Zacks Rank  3 somewhat dims the sparkle Notably  the restaurant industry has been experiencing low consumption over the last few quarters as consumer discretionary spending in this space has been pretty sluggish  In addition  high labor costs as well as the company s investments in several initiatives have been weighing on margins Nevertheless  in order to navigate through the challenging macro environment  the company has implemented four major sales building initiatives in 2017  which have been tested over the past year  Increased focus on technology driven initiatives  like digital ordering  should also boost sales  Additionally  a deep pipeline of new menu items  loyalty program enhancements and other productivity initiatives are likely to further drive performance So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn bullish in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like

Logitech International  NASDAQ LOGI  had a fantastic day on Wednesday  up 3 72  or 17   to 25 22  on 4 3 million shares traded  The base broke out with a breakaway gap  then ran up and flagged  popped at resistance  pulled back and tested  and then had a big pop on Wednesday  I expect it to get to 28  Typically  when you see a stock move like this it will have a much bigger move coming  It s the highest it s been since 2008  and wouldn t shock me if it made a run to the 31 32 zone  Let s keep close tabs on this one 
Unisys Corporation  NYSE UIS  had a big day on Wednesday  up 1 79  or 20   to 10 74  on 4 million shares traded  on a very strong earnings report  With only 20 days to cover  it popped and actually closed  and filled the gap  That may be why there was some difficulty at the end of the day punching through 10 75  If it does follow through  we could see 12  and have a swing on this one for 12 and 14 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc   NYSE CMG  had a big breakdown  and got smacked almost 40 points on Wednesday  down 37 65  or 9   to 368 02  on 6 million shares traded  The consolidation range for the last 90 days was broken on over 6 million shares  Looking at the weekly chart  it broke the entire support zone and may very well test support around 350 1  Look for another 10 points down  and that should get this stock near mid channel  closer to 335  That wouldn t shock me

8699,230214,BJRI,What s In Store For BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"BJ s Restaurants  Inc   NASDAQ BJRI   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 26 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17 5   In fact  the company delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters  bringing the average surprise to 18 52  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement BJ S RESTAURANT Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Consider
The company s Project Q initiative  which reduced average kitchen hours leading to labor efficiencies  have led to strong margins in the past few quarters and are expected to continue to do so in the to be reported quarter  The company is also committed to raise its operating margins through cost containment initiatives 
Moreover  menu innovation  trimming down of complicated menus  prudent expansion initiatives  and aggressive marketing and operational strategies have remained strong points for the company in the past and are expected to continue to boost sales in the second quarter  Also  the company s investments in technology driven initiatives like digital ordering should add to sales 
However  higher cost of sales and labor costs due to higher wages are expected to keep profits under pressure 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that BJ s Restaurants is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for BJ s Restaurants is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 57 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  BJ s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the restaurant space that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank and are therefore worth considering include 
Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA   with an Earnings ESP of  3 70  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Jack in the Box Inc    NASDAQ JACK   with an Earnings ESP of  1 15  and a Zacks Rank  2

For a clearer picture of the sector  let s take a closer look at some of the recent earnings releases  read       
McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   reported a mixed bag Q2 on July 26 after market close  Its earnings of  1 45 per share  adjusted for strategic charges  came ahead of the Zacks Consensus estimate of  1 38  Barring the effect of strategic charges and prior year restructuring charges of  0 04 per share  diluted earnings per share grew 13  in constant currencies  as per  
Its revenues of  6 265 billion fell 4  year over year mainly due to currency headwinds  In constant currency  the figure declined 1   Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 281 billion  Its global comparable sales rose 3 1   with positive comps noted in all segments  However  comps came   Shares fell about 4 5  on July 26  managing to add over 0 1  after hours 
Panera Bread Co   NASDAQ PNRA   beat on both lines and impressed investors on July 26 after market close  Its earnings of  1 78 per share were up 11  year over year and beat estimate by 3 cents while revenues of  698 9 million  up 3  year over year  beat the estimate by a whisker  Company owned comparable net bakery cafe sales rose 4 2  in Q2  Also  the mid point ofthe 2016 non GAAP earnings per share guided range   Shares advanced about 3 9  after hours on July 26 
Buffalo Wild Wings   NASDAQ BWLD   posted mixed Q2 results  Its earnings of  1 27 per share  up 13 4  year over year  beat Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but its revenues of  490 2 million grew 15  year over year  Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  502 million  However  BWLD shares were up over 5 3  after hours on news that activist investment firm  has taken a bigger stake in the sports themed restaurant chain 
BJ s Restaurants Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   also reported on July 26 and depressed investors by missing on both lines  Earnings missed by a penny while revenues fell short by 1 2   Shares were down 2 7  after hours 
Apart from these recent reporters Yum  Brands Inc    NYSE YUM   came up with mixed results and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc    NYSE CMG   missed on both lines  All in all  the operating backdrop of the sector is definitely not upbeat 
Tough Time Ahead for Restaurant ETF 
If somber earnings are not enough to scare you   on plenty of restaurant stocks may do that  Lately  Stifel Nicolaus and Jefferies tapered their outlook on several restaurant stocks  Jefferies believes that the  industry has at least 18 months of challenges ahead  given weaker comps and increasing labor costs  On the other hand  Stifel got   on restaurants and adopted an industry wide recession outlook  
Moreover  McDonald s management noted that food at home inflation is likely to be flat to up about 1  for this year  which is considerably lower than food away from home inflation which is expected to be up 2 5  to 3 5   Naturally  such a wide difference in prices may discourage guests from eating out frequently 
All these developments put the pure play ETF on the restaurant industry   Restaurant ETF    in focus  The fund may slip in the days to come on slowly mounting pressure  see

8711,230226,BJRI,Chipotle  CMG  Loses Most Popular Mexican Restaurant Tag ,opinion,"Per an annual survey from Harris Poll  Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc    NYSE CMG   is no longer the favored brand among fast casual Mexican restaurants 
	Notably  the Harris Poll amasses opinions regarding restaurant brands and Chipotle failed to retain its leading spot after topping the polls for the past three years Poll Results
	Harris Poll surveyed over 97 000 U S  consumers for their views on over 3 800 brands  Notably  Moe s Southwest Grill  a Tex Mex chain  secured the first position for ranking the highest in terms of familiarity  superiority and purchase consideration 
	Moe s Southwest Grill is owned by the same company that operates shopping mall mainstays Auntie Anne s and Cinnabon  It is a big win for Moe s Southwest Grill as it has nearly 650 outlets compared to Chipotle s over 2 000 
	Notably  the three other restaurants that outranked Chipotle were Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM   owned Taco Bell  Jack in the Box Inc  s   NASDAQ JACK   subsidiary Qdoba and Baja Fresh Reasons Why Chipotle Was Unseated
	Chipotle s performance has been largely damaged by the food safety issues it has faced in the recent past 


		CHIPOTLE MEXICAN Price



   


	The restaurant chain has been reeling under the negative publicity related to the E  coli outbreak  which began in Oregon and Washington at the end of last October and later spread to 12 states  Also  in Dec 2015  a norovirus outburst at a Chipotle outlet in Boston s Cleveland Circle affected around 136 diners  including 30 students of Boston College 
	Meanwhile  though the negative media hype cannot be ignored  the fact that Chipotle is forced to pull shutters down on a store as soon as it is reopened has been very damaging  This is largely because of contaminated food and the continuing effect of the E  coli outbreak 
	Meanwhile other restaurants have been working on providing customers with healthier food and innovative menu options in the fast casual restaurant space  intensifying competition for Chipotle 
	Notably  Qdoba rolled out a new taco menu last year while Taco Bell has been doing well  especially in the U S   over the past few quarters on the back of strong sales in the breakfast category  Moe s Southwest Grill has also gained popularity on the back of its build your own tacos  quesadillas and burrito bowls  Chipotle  on the other hand  lags behind on the menu innovation front   Our Take
	The fact that Chipotle has been using healthy ingredients has been its marketing strength despite the high prices  With food safety issues still looming large  Chipotle has its back to the wall 
	Though the company is leaving no stone unturned to gain back customers through the adoption of new food safety protocols  offers for free burritos  buy one get one deals and a few menu innovations  it will take some time for the fast casual restaurant operator to witness a turnaround in its business 
	Chipotle was featured recently in s Trending Stocks where he discussed the recent changes among the food industry

8755,230270,BJRI,Sunshine Appears As Equities Post Strong Gains,opinion," Optimism is a happiness magnet  If you stay positive  good things and good people will be drawn to you   Mary Lou Retton

The world can be a downright difficult place  so much so one can be forgiven if they get down once in a while  Going a step further  there are plenty of people in the world who always are  to put it kindly  a bit difficult  Generally I try and minimize contact with these individuals as much as possible  but there are some days when you are booked solid with dour Dans  As it relates to the investment world  it seems the general consensus among participants is to adopt a generally pessimistic attitude about what the rest of 2016 has in store for markets  After the first month and a half  you could understand why  as it was the worst period for stocks in quite a long time  down 10  in most major markets 
If you look at the last twenty years for investors in domestic markets  they have experienced the internet bubble and crash  the accounting frauds at Enron and WorldCom  Bernie Madoff  the housing boom and bust  Lehman  American International Group Inc  N AIG   Washington Mutual  and the unprecedented government intervention to save markets from what may have been a situation more dangerous than the Great Depression  It is understandable why placing hard earned dollars into the stock market is now viewed as  at the very least  an activity to be skeptical about  The apprehension and negative market psychology remains the overriding obstacle for equity investors  probably now more than ever 
Still  this week the market showed signs of getting off the floor as a good retail sales number last Friday  a rebound in oil as Russia  Iran and Venezuela negotiated production caps  and some bargain hunting all helped the cause  The last six months have been a trying period but it has provided an opportunity to purchase top notch companies at far better prices  If you are long term investor  you are probably grinning ear to ear  It seems Mary Lou Retton  quite the accomplished gymnast  knew a thing or too about investing as well 
There were a ton of individual companies which reported earnings this week  In the retail sector  the head honcho remains Wal Mart  which saw flat revenue and same store sales figures on Wednesday  They still earned nearly  5 billion for the quarter  Nordson Corporation  O NDSN   a high quality department store group  also missed estimates with sales store sales falling over 3   In the tech universe  NVIDIA Corporation  O NVDA  posted a good number  earning  35 cents versus   32 expected  Dining concerns Restaurant Brands  BJs Restaurants Inc  O BJRI   and The Cheesecake Factory  O CAKE  beat estimates as Burger King  Tim Horton s  pizza  and a good piece of cake remain time tested money makers  Next week  plenty more report including Target Corporation  N TGT   Fitbit Inc  N FIT   Home Depot  N HD   and Macy s Inc  N M   Stay tuned

Why the Upgrade  On Oct 23  BJ s Restaurants Inc  s third quarter 2014 earnings of 23 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior year figure of 13 cents by 76 9   Revenues in the reported quarter also grew 9 7  year over year to  206 5 million  due to comps growth  However  revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  208 0 million by a meager 0 9     Comps in the quarter increased 0 3   which compared favorably with a decline of 2 2  in the prior year quarter  This was primarily due to a 0 7  increase in guest counts  partially offset by a lower average check  Restaurant level margins were 17 6   up 130 basis points year over year  mainly due to the higher year over year sales combined with the cost containment and Project Q initiatives  which focused on improving kitchen productivity while enhancing food quality  Further  we are also encouraged by the company s decision to launch its smaller prototype restaurants  which requires lower investments  in various markets  BJ s Restaurants is steadily moving towards its target of opening 11 new restaurants  based on the new restaurant design  in 2014  Till date the company has opened 10 restaurants  with the last opening scheduled to take place next week Fort Myers  Florida  In our view  with commodity costs staying at an all time high  lower investment by the company will be beneficial to its margins  And the fact that the company is focusing on its expansion plans without sacrificing margins is laudable  In fact  we believe the smaller prototype restaurant will be the primary driver for the company s long term goal of a restaurant level margin of 19  Other Stocks to Consider The following companies with a favorable Zacks Rank that are worth considering include DineEquity  Inc   NYSE DIN   Ruby Tuesday  Inc   NYSE RT  and Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE DPZ   While DineEquity and Ruby Tuesday carry the same Zacks Rank as BJ s Restaurants  Domino s Pizza sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2014-11-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bj's-restaurants-upped-to-strong-buy-on-strong-q3-earnings-232627,232627
8760,230275,BJRI,3 Hot Sector Stocks For This Earnings Season,opinion,"The fourth quarter earnings season not only looks weak  but is also stuck in a web of global political and economic woes  The acceleration seen in economic growth is limited only to the U S  as global growth is clearly in jeopardy  Both the S P 500 and Dow Jones have lately been in the red  losing 1 9  and 1 7   respectively  year to date 
 This is especially true as oil price is not showing any sign of a rebound  speculations of Greece departing from Eurozone are rife  and the Swiss bank surprisingly abandoned its currency cap spreading jitters across the globe  Further  sluggish data from China  global economic growth concerns and hopes of a big stimulus from European Central Bank  ECB  have kept the market highly volatile  In such a backdrop  investors could definitely take advantage of the beaten down stock prices to profit from the Q4 earnings season and may look to the sectors that are grabbing attention in 2015  Here  we focus on three hot sectors  industrial products  retail and  of course  energy  All these have lately taken a hit and are thus cheaper than many other sectors  The stocks in these popular sectors are also expected to post stronger earnings in Q4  Zeroing in on the stocks of these in focus sectors that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release and have seen their prices sliding lately would therefore be a good idea to play this earnings season How to Choose Stocks  Earnings beat will definitely inspire investor confidence and propel the price of these sector stocks higher  Picking the star performers would be easy if we go by our proprietary methodology that selects stocks with a combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive   Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have the maximum chance to surprise with their upcoming earnings announcements  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   Below  we have highlighted three beaten down stocks from the hottest sectors that will likely deliver an earnings beat when their results are released in the coming weeks  The outperformance would drive the share price higher  resulting in above market returns Industrial Products
One corner of this space   industrial metals    saw a broad sell off last week triggered by the copper meltdown as the World Bank lowered its 2015 global growth forecast to 3  from 3 4   The bank cited ongoing sluggishness in China   the world s biggest consumer of copper  sluggishness in the Eurozone and Japan  as well as weakness in key emerging markets like Russia  Brazil and China as the reasons for its downward revision  In this environment  Noranda Aluminum Holding  NYSE NOR   having a Zacks Rank  1 and Earnings ESP of 50   seems exciting great pick  The company has seen its estimates rising by 2 cents to 10 cents over the past seven days  representing a substantial 183 3  year over year growth  In addition  it delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 17 31   Shares of NOR are down over 12  in the year to date period  suggesting a good buying opportunity on expectations of a bullish momentum over the coming weeks  Based in Franklin  TN  Noranda Aluminum is a leading North American integrated producer of primary aluminum products and high quality rolled aluminum coils  The company is scheduled to report earnings on Feb 18  read    Retail While weak December retail sales data baffled many retailers  overall holiday sales  November and December    up 4  to  616 1 billion and in line with the National Retail Federation  NRF    reached their highest level since 2011  Notably  retail sales dipped 0 9  in December  marking the largest monthly decline in almost a year  followed by an increase of 0 4  in November  The solid holiday numbers will definitely boost earnings for retailers  making them attractive at present  Among these  BJs Restaurants Inc  NASDAQ BJRI  with a Zacks Rank  1 and Earnings ESP of 4 76  seems to be a solid pick  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter   up by a penny over the past 30 days to 21 cents   suggests a whopping 244 44  increase from the year ago quarter  The stock delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters  with an average beat of 33 81  and is down nearly 12  year to date  Based in Huntington Beach  CA  BJ s Restaurants is the owner and operator of casual dining restaurants in the Unites States  It offers pizzas  beers  appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  salads and desserts under the brand names of BJ s Restaurant and Brewery  BJ s Restaurant and Brewhouse  BJ s Pizza   Grill and BJ s Grill  The company is expected to report on Feb 18 Energy The energy sector has been on a downslide over the past six months with fundamentals getting even worse in 2015  The relentless slide in oil prices this year primarily came from higher crude stockpiles  increased U S  production  reduced OPEC demand  and hopes of a European stimulus  Further  a number of brokerage firms have provided a bearish outlook on the oil prices  reducing their price target on the commodity  However  investors could easily tap this beaten down sector with Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc  NYSE DO   which is looking pretty solid from an earnings perspective  The stock has an Earnings ESP of 4 62  and consistently beat earnings estimates over the past four quarters with an average beat of 24 32

Paycom Software   NYSE PAYC  put out a swing on Thursday because a wedge was broken  It looked really good intraday as well  and then it pulled back  It looks like it s not done yet  3 waves up  and a fourth and fifth wave could take it over 40

8762,230277,BJRI,Restaurant Industry Stock Outlook  May 2015,opinion,"The U S  restaurant industry began 2015 on a solid note  Per TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  the first quarter of the year proved to be the best for the industry since the Great Recession  Despite inclement weather and a faltering U S economy  same store sales grew in all three months of the first quarter at an average of 2 8   Improved job prospects  rising wages  lower gasoline prices and renewed optimism as a result of the housing recovery were the biggest contributors 
Driven by higher same store sales and a continued optimistic outlook for future business conditions  the Restaurant Performance Index in March was above 100 for the 25th consecutive month  the Current Situation Index was above 100 for the 13th consecutive month  and the Expectations Index was above 100 for the 29th consecutive month  Meanwhile  with severe winter weather conditions subsiding  restaurant sales rebounded in April  which possibly signals better second quarter results  Per TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  same store sales rose 1 9  in April  Given the positive factors  the restaurant industry is expected to generate sales of more than  709 0 billion in 2015    marking the sixth consecutive year of real  inflation adjusted  sales growth for the industry  However  the growth rate is quite modest owing to a still constrained consumer spending environment  Despite moderate improvement in economic growth  consumers are increasing their spending slightly as they are busy saving  This is reflected in traffic trends that have not shown much improvement  Meanwhile  a fluctuating consumer confidence index reflects uncertainty  Additionally  rising food and labor costs and currency rates remain headwinds  Nevertheless  per market analysts  the overall industry is relatively well positioned compared to the past years

8764,230279,BJRI,3 Retail Growth Stocks To Kick Start Q2 Earnings Season,opinion,"It is time to rejuvenate your portfolio once again  as we gradually head toward second quarter earnings season  Nonetheless  the unpredictability which is so characteristic of the market continues to haunt every investor  Things have not changed much from the first quarter which was defined by a strong dollar  weakness in the energy sector and global growth issues 
However  a little groundwork will definitely give a fair idea that the economy isn t in such a bad shape as was perceived when the  second estimate  released by the Commerce Department revealed that GDP shrank 0 7  in first quarter 2015   harsh winter weather  strikes at Western Coast ports  a stronger dollar hampering exports  and decline in business investment were cited as the reasons behind the meltdown 
Instead  gradual recovery in the housing market  the strengthening manufacturing sector  an improving labor market and lower gasoline prices are favoring the economy  Moreover  progress related to Greece s debt deal may also support growth  Industry analysts predict that the encouraging economic data will be reflected in interest rate hike sometime later in the year  However  they are keeping their fingers crossed regarding markets  reactions 
Coming to numbers  recent data shows that unemployment claims dropped by 12 000 for the week ended Jun 13  to a seasonally adjusted 267 000 versus the consensus estimate of 276 500  while the unemployment rate is hovering around 5 5   Consumer confidence   a key determinant of financial health   is also improving  making the future look brighter  In fact  the preliminary data released by the University of Michigan highlighted that the consumer sentiment index has jumped to 94 6 in June from the May reading of 90 7 
However  despite a convincing economic recovery  consumer spending remained flat in April  following a 0 5  increase in March  Consumer spending  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity  decelerated to a rate of 1 8  in first quarter 2015 from 4 4  in fourth quarter 2014 
It is quite apparent that market sentiment is influenced by a number of events  Well  now there are two choices    either be a spectator and wait for a convincing economic climate  or be a front runner by identifying stocks that have the potential to outperform even when market conditions are not congenial  However  it might be difficult for one to look at each parameter and compare with the peer group for an analysis on whether the stock is attractive from the growth perspective 
To make the task easy  Zacks has designed the new Style Score System  The attractiveness of a stock as an investment option is confirmed by its Growth Style Score of  A   or  B    The Growth Style Score combines conventional growth metrics with a thorough analysis of the company s income statement  balance sheet and statements of cash flows to evaluate its financial health and the sustainability of its growth trajectory  Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential

spending  which accounts for over two thirds of U S  economic activity  witnessed a sharp increase in almost seven years  The Commerce Department unveiled that consumer spending advanced 1  in April better than analysts  expectation of a 0 7  rise and up significantly from a flat reading in March and a 0 2  jump in February Consumers purchased automobiles and other durable goods with renewed vigor  as personal income increased 0 4  and disposable personal income rose 0 5   April stood out as the best month since Aug 2009 with respect to consumer spending  Strong consumer spending is a sheer reflection of the economy gaining momentum which had nearly stalled in the beginning of the year  with a tepid 0 8  growth in the first quarter Market experts remained cautiously optimistic about acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter  On the one hand  they are citing that consumers are likely to spend more supported by rising income  an improving job market and gains in house price  On the other hand  they are not ignoring the fact that consumer confidence dampened somewhat last month  According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index dipped to 92 6 in May from April s revised reading of 94 7  and also came in below analysts  projection of 96 0 With an expected rebound in the economy  the retail space is bubbling with optimism  Industry analysts predict that encouraging economic data might reflect in an interest rate hike   a step toward  normalizing monetary policy   Well  the Federal Reserve is surely keeping a close watch on the ongoing economic activities and will arrive at a decision only after taking into account all the relevant factors But for now  how about being a wise investor  Let s look for some retail stocks

long the improvement will last linger  Market pundits believe that an improving labor market and rising income will surely increase confidence and instigate spending  And if this happens and sustains  it will largely help the economy to emerge strongly  A balanced economy with inflation gradually crawling toward the desired level of 2  may prompt the Fed Chair Janet Yellen to go for a rate hike  In

8784,230299,BJRI,Dave   Buster s   4 Other Restaurant Stocks To Bet On,opinion,Based in Texas  Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY   began trading in Oct 2014  The core concept of the restaurateur is  Eat Drink Play and Watch   all in one location  Its menu comprises  Fun American New Gourmet  entr es and appetizers and a full selection of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverages Notably  the long term growth prospects of the company are compelling  given its strong sales  earnings growth and significant margin improvement Particularly  we believe that the company s efforts to build sales and improve margins through various initiatives such as continual opening of stores  menu innovation  launch of new games and the new Fun American New Gourmet and beverage options should help the company boost its top and bottom line  going ahead Notably  the company has reported six quarterly results so far  exceeding expectations every time  In fact  the company has an average positive earnings surprise of 105 37  for the trailing four quarters  Meanwhile  share price of the company has soared nearly 25  in the past one year Moreover  analysts are quite bullish on the stock

What s Driving the Restaurant Stocks The U S  restaurant industry gained momentum at the start of 2016 on the back of improving consumer spending patterns  which in turn were positively influenced by

8786,230301,BJRI,Nordstrom No Longer En Vouge  4 Retail Stocks To Buy Instead,opinion,Investors want their portfolio to have stocks with a track record of better than expected results  surging share price and favorable recommendation  However  Nordstrom Inc    NYSE JWN   has failed to meet any of these criteria and is no longer in investors  good books  Nordstrom remains deeply entrenched in the bearish territory as the stock has lost its value by nearly 28  in the past six months This fashion specialty retailer of apparel  shoes  cosmetics and accessories has been witnessing a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   This implies that analysts covering the stock are not hopeful about Nordstrom s performance in the near future Nordstrom Fundamentally WeakNordstrom commenced fiscal 2016 on a downbeat note  continuing with its disappointing performance in the fiscal first quarter  wherein both the top and the bottom lines lagged estimates for the third time in a row  Earnings plunged sharply year over year  bearing the brunt of lower than anticipated sales and soft margins that stemmed from higher markdowns so as to efficiently align inventory with the existing trends  These factors also led the company to lower its earnings and sales projections for fiscal 2016  A competitive retail landscape and consumers  cautionary approach while purchasing discretionary items are also weighing on the stock s performance   Read more   Nordstrom s Numbers Are Not of Any Help EitherNordstrom continued with its dismal run  posting a negative earnings surprise of 42 2  in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  after an earnings miss of 4 1  and 19 7  in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2015  respectively  In the trailing four quarters  the company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15 7  Nordstrom s fiscal first quarter earnings of 26 cents a share came in way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents and declined 60 6  from the prior year quarter figure of 66 cents  Following the disappointing performance  the company lowered its outlook for fiscal 2016  Management now envisions fiscal 2016 earnings per share in the range of  2 50  2 70  down from  3 10  3 35 expected earlier Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 55 and  2 87 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has dropped 63 cents and 64 cents  respectively  over the past 30 days  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has decreased 16 cents to 56 cents over the same time frame With Nordstrom s share price tumbling and estimates witnessing downward revisions  it may not be prudent to keep the stock in your portfolio  at least for the time being  Rather  you can shift your focus to better ranked retail stocks that are backed by a sound Zacks Consensus Estimate revision  a  of  A  and sturdy fundamentals 4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW    which holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a VGM Score of  A  and long term earnings growth rate of 15 6   The Mooresville  NC based company delivered an average

8794,230309,BJRI,Moving Average Crossover Alert  BJ s Restaurants  BJRI ,opinion,"BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for BJRI broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 8 6  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for BJRI stock 
If that wasn t enough  BJ s Restaurants isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  11 estimates have been reduced  while one has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for BJRI ",2016-08-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert:-bj's-restaurants-(bjri)-200148538,200148538
