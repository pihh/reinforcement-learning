The Gaithersburg  Maryland   based company already has a vaccine in development against MERS   another type of coronavirus 
But while reports of a supposed  breakthrough  took financial markets out of their rut this week and sparked optimism that researchers could find an effective treatment  companies Reuters spoke to said not so fast   warning they have a long way to go to help those infected   
  from the outbreak of the flu like virus that has killed more than 500 people in China and shows no signs of slowing down  with thousands of new cases reported each day  
But Novavax research chief   Gregory Glenn   thinks the bio tech company is in a good position  
 Novavax  has in the past gone from getting the gene sequence  identifying the virus to starting testing in 90 days for ebola and for a pandemic potential flu vaccine  So we ve done it so everyone is very focused on trying to compress these time frames  
Johnson   Johnson and Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  are also rushing to develop treatments 
And it s no easy feat  according to health experts  to move vaccines from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles 
In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks  there are also regulatory hurdles that include carrying out large clinical trials  
In a process that could push back a drug s release date by a year or more   according to executives from companies involved in the effort  
And it s also pricey 
Investment costs could run as high as  800 million for a vaccine that may or may not prove profitable  
One analyst pointed out that by the time a vaccine is deemed safe   the outbreak could be abating  ",2020-02-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/drugmakers-see-long-road-ahead-in-coronavirus-vaccine-race-2077413,2077413

200587,422103,GILD,Gilead Sciences  Still on the Path to Recovery,news,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  reported fourth quarter earnings after the market close on Feb  5 and the stock price fell 2  the following day  Although the company beat expectations at the top line  profits and earnings per share both disappointed  and guidance for 2020 underwhelmed investors 
With the stock trading close to its multi year lows  the results provided little cause for optimism that things would be turning around at any time soon 
Gilead reported another mixed set of earnings results
Both bullish and bearish investors could find some solace in the results  On the negative side  profitability suffered due to an increase in costs and expenses with non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share falling 10  year over year versus expectations of positive 10  growth  Gilead s hepatitis C virus  HCV  franchise    historically its main profit engine    continued to suffer  with overall revenues down 15  in the quarter  And guidance for next year came in on the light side of expectations  suggesting little to no growth for 2020  For someone who holds Gilead shares  patience seems to be turning into more of a vice than a virtue 

But the long term investment thesis remains intact
At the same time  however  the results contained some silver linings for the long term bull  Revenues increased  continuing their trend over the last several quarters  and reversing the many years of declines which took the stock down close to 50   Gilead s HIV franchise continues to be industry leading  with revenues up 12  year over year  And this leadership is likely to continue  Management expects that Biktarvy    its industry leading HIV drug    will continue to be the preferred treatment option through the next decade 
Nor will expense pressures continue into next year  The margin hit that Gilead took in the fourth quarter was caused primarily by one off inventory writedowns associated with its HCV drugs  Gilead does not expect this to be repeated next year and anticipates gross margins returning to the 86  to 87  level  which was the norm in prior quarters 
The longer term investment case for Gilead remains intact  The HCV franchise will be less of a drag on earnings while Gilead continues to develop its diverse pipeline across promising hepatitis B  non alcoholic steatohepatitis  oncology  and immunology products   Management also highlighted China as an opportunity for growth  with eight products approved since 2017 and four recently approved for reimbursement in 2020  
Gilead also has been aggressive in looking externally for product opportunities and has entered into 33 strategic partnerships and investment transactions since January 2018  It has a long history of making acquisitions  and its track record in this area has been exemplary    the best example being its acquisition of Pharmasset in 2011 for  11 billion  which generated  25 billion in profits over five years  
Not only does management have the will to make the necessary changes  but it also has the means  It has net cash on its balance sheet courtesy of over  25 billion in cash and marketable securities  Free cash flow has been more than sufficient to fund dividend growth and share buybacks  Gilead announced an 8  hike in its dividend for 2020  making it five consecutive years of dividend growth  With the health stock yielding more than 4  and trading at a little more than 10 times earnings  Gilead is priced for little or no growth   It may well surprise on the upside ",2020-02-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psrsl,2079836
200588,422104,GILD,1 Big Question to Ask Yourself Before Buying Gilead Sciences Stock,news,"Timing matters  
If you had bought shares of Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  in early 2012 and held on  you d have more than tripled your initial investment  But if you had bought the biotech stock in mid 2015 and still owned the shares  you d be sitting on a loss of more than 40  
With Gilead s share price hovering near its lowest point in the last seven years  some investors could be wondering if now is the time to jump aboard  If you re in that group  there s one big question you need to ask yourself first  How long are you prepared to hold onto Gilead Sciences stock 

Near term malaise
Gilead Sciences reported some revenue growth in its 2019 fourth quarter results  but that growth wasn t anything to write home about  More importantly  the midpoint of the company s full year 2020 product sales guidance reflected a slight decline from its full year 2019 sales 
The picture for Gilead could be even worse in the first quarter of 2020 than in the rest of the year  Gilead CFO Andrew Dickinson said in the biotech s Q4 earnings conference call that Q1 sales will decline both on a year over year basis and on a quarter over quarter basis  
There are a couple of factors at work behind the near term malaise  Gilead usually experiences negative seasonal inventory and buying patterns early in the year  The company will also feel the brunt in Q1 with year over year comparisons of sales for Ranexa and Letairis  Both cardiopulmonary drugs lost exclusivity in 2019 
Gilead s share price received a boost recently on the news that it s working with Chinese authorities to test antiviral drug remdesivir in treating the 2019 nCoV coronavirus strain that s causing worldwide concerns  However  Johanna Mercier  Gilead s Chief Commercial Officer  said that the coronavirus outbreak could cause some delays in progress with marketing hepatitis B drug Vemlidy and HIV drug Genvoya in China 
Another headwind on the way for Gilead is that a generic version of Truvada hits the U S  market later in 2020  Generics have already taken a toll on European sales of the HIV drug  
The bottom line is that if you re looking to make a quick buck  Gilead Sciences probably isn t the stock for you  The chances appear to be high that there will be more bad news than good news for the biotech over the next several months 
Long term potential
But if you re a long term investor with an investing horizon of at least five years  Gilead could be worth a serious look  The biotech s bad news should fade  while there are plenty of opportunities for good news on the way 
Let s start with Gilead s current challenges  Sure  the company will feel the pain from the losses of exclusivity for Ranexa and Letairis this year  However  year over year comparisons will improve significantly in 2021  
What about the negative impact of U S  generic competition for Truvada  It might take a couple of years for Gilead to fully move past the blow  But Biktarvy is already cannibalizing sales of Gilead s other HIV drugs  and Descovy is picking up steam as a pre exposure prophylactic for HIV 
More importantly  Gilead has new growth drivers potentially on the way  The company expects to win regulatory approvals for filgotinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis this year  Gilead believes that the drug will be the best in class JAK inhibitor and is ramping up for a major commercial launch in the U S   Europe  and Japan 
Filgotinib should be the first of 10 transformative drugs that Gilead CEO Daniel O Day is pushing the biotech to launch over the next 10 years  The company will potentially look to its partnership with Galapagos to fill in some of the other nine slots  Gilead is also counting on its long acting HIV capsid inhibitor to be the foundation of its HIV franchise of the future 
Don t ignore Gilead s opportunities to make more deals  O Day said that the company  will continue to make investments in our external pipeline including transformative partnerships such as Galapagos and small to medium size bolt on acquisitions   With a cash stockpile of more than  25 billion  Gilead shouldn t have any problems funding its business development efforts 
A question not just for Gilead
My view is that whether Gilead Sciences is a good stock to buy depends entirely on your answer to the big question posed earlier  But the question of how long you re willing to hold onto shares isn t just one for Gilead  It s not limited to just biotech stocks  either  You should ask yourself this question before you buy any stock 
The Motley Fool recently tweeted   To outperform you can be  Smarter than other investors  Luckier than other investors  More patient than other investors  The last is where the big money is made   That s exactly right 
If you re a patient investor  you can make tremendous returns over the long run  I expect this will be true for investors who buy Gilead Sciences and hold on ",2020-02-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pszxg,2080023
200589,422105,GILD,FDA Grants a Priority Review To Gilead Sciences  Cancer Therapy,news,"Today  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  disclosed its next cell based cancer therapy could become available this summer  The Food and Drug Administration recently granted a priority review to an application Gilead submitted a couple of months ago for KTE X19 with an expected action date of Aug  10  2019 
Not exactly new
Gilead s potential new cancer therapy isn t exactly new  It s basically Yescarta with an improved manufacturing process that the company has aimed at a small segment of non Hodgkin lymphoma patients  Yescarta and KTE X19 are both CAR T therapies made with cells harvested from patients that are trained to recognize cells with the CD19 antigen on their surface 
To get its hands on Yescarta and a handful of experimental CAR T therapies in development  Gilead Sciences acquired Kite Pharma in 2017 for  11 9 billion 

Since a new batch of Yescarta and KTE X19 must be manufactured for every patient  many of whom need to begin a new treatment regimen immediately  improvements to the process can have a big effect  This appears to be the case with KTE X19 and mantle cell lymphoma patients that have exhausted additional treatment options  During a study supporting Gilead s application  a single infusion of KTE X19 helped 67  of patients achieve complete remission 
Getting crowded 
The FDA recently approved a Bruton s tyrosine kinase  BTK  inhibitor called Brukinsa from Beigene  NASDAQ BGNE  for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma patients who have relapsed at least once  Brukinsa itself is up against Imbruvica which has been in the second line position for mantle cell lymphoma patients since 2013 
Since just 6  of patients with non Hodgkin lymphomas are diagnosed with the mantle cell variety  this space looks like it could get crowded fast  Sales of Gilead s new therapy will probably remain limited to a very small audience that has already exhausted all available treatment options ",2020-02-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptfqn,2080924
200590,422106,GILD,Is Gilead Sciences an Acquisition Target ,news,"Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD  latest earnings report and full year outlook didn t exactly inspire confidence among investors last week  The biotech heavyweight told the investing community a week ago today that its top line will likely dip yet again this year thanks to falling hep C drug sales and the slower than expected commercialization of its anti cancer cell therapy Yescarta 
Wall Street  for its part  is even less optimistic about the big biotech s near term prospects  The average analyst estimate has the biotech s annual sales declining for the next two full years  That s a surprising take to be sure  given the strong possibility that Gilead s blockbuster in waiting  filgotinib  will likely hit the market soon   
The big deal is that the biotech s market capitalization has been bumping up against its five year low lately thanks to this rather anemic outlook  In response  Jefferies  analyst Michael Yee published a note last week suggesting that Gilead might now be an attractive takeover target  Its large cap biopharma peers Allergan and Celgene  after all  both turned into top acquisition targets when their respective market caps bottomed out  

Is a possible takeover reason enough to buy Gilead s stock right now  Let s take a deeper look to find out 
Gilead s takeover thesis isn t compelling
The main reason shareholders should mull over this idea is that Gilead s management would obviously demand a healthy premium in a takeover scenario  In fact  it would most likely require a 30  premium    at a bare minimum    to win over the biotech s brain trust  That s a decent payday for the biotech s long suffering shareholders  to be sure  Unfortunately  we d be looking at a deal valued at no less than a monstrous  115 billion at those levels  
When it comes to acquisitions  size most definitely matters  After all  the only two American mega pharmas that could possibly swallow Gilead whole are Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   While J J has some noteworthy synergies with Gilead s clinical pipeline and product portfolio  the Band Aid maker isn t exactly known for mega mergers of this size  What s more  J J is one of the few large cap biopharmas that doesn t really have a glaring hole to fill via M A  So  there s no particularly good reason to think that J J would be willing to place undue stress on its nearly pristine balance sheet in order to gobble up Gilead  
Pfizer doesn t come across as a likely suitor  either    for a multitude of reasons  Chief among them  the pharma giant recently announced plans to slim down to unlock the latent growth potential of newer products such as breast cancer medication Ibrance  Pfizer does reportedly have interest in pursuing additional bolt on acquisitions to flesh out its emerging growth portfolio  But the company seems intent on sticking to small to mid sized deals to achieve this key operational goal  Pfizer and Gilead also don t share a whole lot of clear cut synergies  As such  it s hard to imagine that Pfizer would have any serious interest in buying Gilead  either  
What s next 
Gilead is almost certainly not going to be the next Allergan or Celgene  The long and short of it is that the big biotech is still far too large to be consumed by one of its peers  despite its prolonged trough period  So  if you re hoping for a quick buck on a buyout scenario  you might want to look elsewhere  Gilead simply doesn t fit the bill ",2020-02-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptti6,2081837

areas  One  our strong base business  two  the existing pipeline opportunities  and three  our new strategy to drive innovation and growth So I ll begin by saying a few words about the strength of our core business  starting with HIV where we again achieved record revenue for both the quarter and the year  Today  approximately 80  of people living with HIV  who are on therapy in US are on a Gilead based regimen  Across the franchise  we ve seen durability and sustainability of the business  which we expect to continue in 2020 and beyond  Much of the strength is being driven by Biktarvy  Today in US  approximately one in two patients  who are new to therapy and patients who are switching therapy are initiating on Biktarvy  We re also very pleased with the early progress with Descovy for PrEP  The strength of the launch and the positive response we are seeing from patients and providers  Johanna will share more details shortly on that Looking to the future  we re focused on the potential of our capsid inhibitor as the anchor molecule for multiple long acting HIV options  We may be able to dose as frequently as twice a year  and we re working rapidly to progress this medicine for both HIV prevention and treatment  Rounding out the antiviral picture  we continue to see sustained revenue from our HCV business  since the introduction of authorized generics in the US  we ve regained market share and now hold around 60  share through Asegua and Gilead  up 18 points from the beginning of last year Finally  as we look across our core business  I d like to highlight the geographic expansion and in particular China  During the fourth quarter  we had four medicines  Vemlidy  Epclusa  Harvoni and Genvoya included in China s national reimbursement drug list  This is a significant accomplishment that will enable much broader access to these medicines in the region So beyond our core business our current pipeline include several important opportunities that I d like to cover  We have 14 late stage studies under way  four of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA  During the fourth quarter  we submitted a regulatory filing for filgotinib to the FDA and it s now under priority review for rheumatoid arthritis  Filgotinib is also under review in Japan and the EU  We re actively preparing for competitive launches globally  which Joanna will talk more about later  I m encouraged about the potential of filgotinib to be best in class among the JAK inhibitors and the strength of the team we have in place to market the medicine following approval Beyond filgotinib we are pleased with what we see in the Galapagos pipeline and believe that the partnership has the potential to drive significant future growth  We are looking forward to the ulcerative colitis data this year and we remain very optimistic about both our partnership with Galapagos as well as a promising inflammation pipeline we have in hand And cell therapy  we have a pioneering platform that is enabling us to advance new therapies  with the goal of driving long term innovation and growth  To that end  our second cell therapy treatment  Kite X19 is now under review in the US and Europe as a treatment for relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma  This follows the presentation of positive data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in the fourth quarter of this year  We also presented data at ASH showing the approximately half of patients treated with Yescarta for relapsed refractory large B cell lymphoma were still alive after three years of treatment in the Zuma one study confirming Yescarta is benefit risk profile in the real world setting  These long term data speak to the durability of Yescarta s treatment  Finally  in cell therapy  we look forward to sharing results from our Yescarta Phase 3 second line  DLBCL trial in the second half of this year  Merdad will offer some more color on our pipeline in just a few minutes In addition to the programs  I ve described that we have in hand  I introduced our new corporate strategy last month  This strategy will guide our work as we seek to drive innovation and growth over the next decade  Over the next 10 years  we aim to introduce 10 new transformative therapies  To help us achieve that ambition  we will expand our access to internal and external innovation We ve already been very active in business development with around 33 strategic partnerships and investment transaction since January 2018  We ll continue to pursue a broad range of opportunities with a clear focus on our core scientific areas of strength  Specifically  we will continue to make investments in our external pipeline including transformative partnerships such as Galapagos and small to medium size bolt on acquisitions  Andy will talk more in a few minutes about our capital allocation priorities including today s announcement of a further increase in our dividend and it additional share repurchase authorization and our strong financial position  which gives us the opportunity to look externally as we strengthen our pipeline Before I hand off to Andy who will delve into a more detailed financial review  I d like to say just a few words about the broadening outbreak of Coronavirus  As an organization  Gilead is committed to collaborating with global health organizations to support pandemic responses including this one  Our investigational compound  Remdesivir as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens  MERS and SARS  which are structurally similar to the current strain of the Coronavirus  However  there are no antiviral data that show activity against this strain  We re working with the government and non government organizations and regulatory authorities to develop a strategy to provide Remdesivir to patients with Coronavirus for emergency treatment and the absence of any approved treatment options  And to support clinical trials to determine whether it can safely and effectively be used to treat the current strain of Coronavirus  As a reminder  Remdesivir is an investigational agent  It is not approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use  I m proud of our teams and the work we ve done to offer expertise and resources to help patients and communities fighting Coronavirus In closing  I m very optimistic about where we are today and the future  Our base business is strong  durable and growing  As demonstrated by our fourth quarter numbers and year end results  the near term pipeline provide several important opportunities with readouts expected later this year with filgotinib and Yescarta  And over the long term  we ve introduced a new strategy to drive growth by growing our pipeline internally and importantly  also externally through our ongoing BD activities On behalf of the leadership team  I d like to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for the dedication and hard work that led to the success of 2019 and whose commitment is driving our success in 2020 and beyond  I remain excited about the potential of Gilead as we enter the next chapter With that  I ll turn the call over to Andy Andrew Dickinson    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Dan  I m excited to take on the role of CFO  especially during this time as Gilead enters a new chapter  We re pleased to share our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 and provide 2020 guidance today  I ll first review financials  followed by comments from Johanna Turning to our financials  Total revenue for the fourth quarter was  5 9 billion  with non GAAP earnings of  1 30 per diluted share  This compares to revenue of  5 8 billion  with non GAAP earnings of  1 44 per diluted share for the same period last year  Our non GAAP earnings would have been  1 77 and  1 75 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018  respectively excluding unfavorable cost of goods sold impacts  These impacts were primarily driven by inventory writedowns of  500 million and  410 million  respectively for slow moving and excess raw material and work in process inventory largely due to lower long term demand for our HCV products For the full year 2019  total revenues were  22 4 billion  up 1  year over year  Non GAAP diluted earnings were  6 63 per share for the year  down from  6 67 per share for the full year of 2018  Excluding the unfavorable cost of goods impacts I mentioned previously  our non GAAP earnings would have been  7 14 per share for 2019 and  7 01 per share for the prior year As noted in our earnings press release  our full year 2019 GAAP diluted earnings of  4 22 per share included total unfavorable impact of  3 30 per share from the following items  first  pre tax up front collaboration and licensing expense of  3 9 billion associated with our global research and development collaboration agreement with Galapagos  secondly  pre tax impairment charge of  800 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019  primarily related to in process research and development intangible assets for the treatment of indolent non Hodgkin lymphoma  and pre tax writedowns of  547 million for slow moving and excess raw materials and work in process inventories  The unfavorable impact was partially offset by a favorable impact of  1 94 per share  due to a deferred tax benefit of  1 2 billion related to an intra entity transfer of intangible assets and gains of  1 2 billion from equity securities held for investments Now turning to our product sales  Product sales for the fourth quarter were  5 8 billion  up 5  sequentially and 2  year over year  For the full year  product sales were  22 1 billion  up 2  year over year primarily due to the continued revenue growth of our HIV franchise  partially offset by the impact of loss of exclusivity on our cardiopulmonary franchise and market dynamics of our HCV franchise In the US  product sales for the quarter were  4 5 billion  up 8  sequentially and 1  year over year  Demand for Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP was the primary driver of the sequential growth  The seasonal inventory purchases also contributed approximately  290 million to the sequential performance  In Europe  product sales for the quarter were  840 million  up 4  sequentially and 3  year over year  Recall that both the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by unfavorable adjustment for statutory rebates Turning to cell therapy  Worldwide Yescarta sales for the fourth quarter were  122 million  up 3  sequentially and 51  year over year  The year over year increase was driven by a higher number of therapies provided to patients and Kite s continued expansion in Europe Now turning to expenses for the full year 2019  Non GAAP cost of goods sold was  3 5 billion  down 1  compared to  3 6 billion in 2018  The decrease was primarily due to lower royalty expenses  partially offset by higher inventory write downs  During 2019 and 2018  we recorded writedowns of  547 million and  440 million respectively  for slow moving and excess raw materials and work in process inventories primarily due to lower long term demand for our HCV products Non GAAP R D expense was  3 8 billion  up 7  compared to  3 5 billion in 2018  the increase was primarily due to higher personnel cost to support our cell therapy business  Non GAAP SG A expense was  4 1 billion  up 13  compared to  3 6 billion in 2018  the increase was primarily due to higher promotional expenses related to Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP in the US and expenses associated with the expansion of our business in Japan and China Turning to our balance sheet  We generated  9 1 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2019 and  2 6 billion for the quarter  We ended the year with  25 8 billion in cash and marketable debt securities  During 2019 we paid  5 6 billion in connection with our global research and development collaboration with Galapagos and our equity investment in Galapagos  In addition  we repaid  2 8 billion of debt  We paid cash dividends of  3 2 billion and we repurchased 26 million shares of stock for  1 7 billion Earlier today  we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from  0 63 a share to  0 68 a share  which will be effective in the first quarter of 2020  This is our fifth consecutive annual increase in our dividend  In addition  our Board authorized an additional  5 billion share repurchase program in January 2020  We now have over  8 billion of share repurchase authorization available  In 2020  our capital allocation priorities will remain unchanged  First and foremost  we are focused on investment to augment internal and external research and development  our internal research and external development pipeline  Second  we intend to grow the dividend over time  pointing out of course that any dividend increase is subject to the approval of our Board  Finally  our commitment to repurchase shares in excess of dilution from our equity compensation and at a minimum  we expect to repurchase shares in 2020 on par with our 2019 share repurchases Turning to guidance  our 2020 non GAAP financial guidance is summarized on slides 23 through 26 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website  Before I start I d like to highlight three things that are important for you to understand  The first change is that beginning in the first quarter  we will no longer regularly exclude stock based compensation expense from our non GAAP financial information  Stock based compensation as always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of our shareholders and it s an important component of our compensation structure  As such  although it s not a cash expense  we believe it to be a cost that should be included when measuring our financial performance  For comparability purposes  full year 2019 non GAAP operating income and non GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been  10 4 billion and  6 13 per share respectively had stock based compensation expense  not been exclude Our second change is that we re modifying our guidance metrics for 2020 as we will now be providing guidance for earnings and operating income  in addition to the metrics that we ve historically shared  Our guidance is aligned with how the management team and our Board evaluate our financial performance and manage our operations  Finally  our guidance excludes the impact of any future significant business development transactions  certain development milestones and any product option exercise fees as they are contingent on various future events  which have a high degree of uncertainty With that background  we expect that our product sales for 2020 will be in the range of  21 8 billion to  22 2 billion  This guidance reflects robust underlying growth in our base business of approximately  800 million to  1 billion  which is expected to offset the full year impact of loss of exclusivity for our cardiopulmonary products in 2019 and the initial entry of a generic version of Truvada in the US later this year  I would also like to highlight that as we look toward Q1 of 2020  we anticipate the total product sales will decline sequentially that quarter by a percentage similar to what we ve seen over the past three years  which has been as high as 12  to 14  primarily driven by US seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively impact our payer mix  We also anticipate that our Q1 2020 product sales will decline in comparison to Q1 2019  primarily due to lower sales of our cardiopulmonary products  Ranexa and Letairis  As a reminder generic versions of Ranexa and Letairis were launched in the first quarter and second quarter of 2019 respectively  Despite this anticipated sequential decline in total product sales in Q1  I want to underscore our confidence in the health of our worldwide HIV business from which we expect year on year growth again in 2020 Turning to our product gross margins  Our non GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 86  to 87  in 2020  We expect that both non GAAP R D and SG A expenses will increase mid single digit percentage in support of our continued growth of Biktarvy  our Descovy for PrEP launch  preparation for competitive launches of filgotinib in RA in the US  Japan  and Europe and continued investments in our pipeline  cell therapy  and external partnerships Non GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of  10 1 billion to  10 8 billion  For the full year  our non GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21   Non GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of  6 05 per share to  6 45 per share  which again I ll remind you no longer exclude stock based compensation  GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of  5 15 to  5 55  Finally  our diluted EPS guidance includes repurchases largely consistent with 2019 I ll now turn the call over to Johanna Johanna Mercier    Chief Commercial OfficerThank you  Andy and good afternoon everyone  I m really pleased to share the highlights of our excellent Q4 and full year commercial performance  I wanted to begin with the continued strength of our HIV franchise  which was driven by the continued uptake of Biktarvy as well as the successful early launch of Descovy for PrEP  I ll then provide an update on HCV  touch briefly on our cardiopulmonary business and finally close with a few remarks as we look ahead to the filgotinib launch As Dan mentioned  approximately 80  of people living with HIV who are on therapy in the US are taking at least one Gilead drug  a sign of the sustained and durable strength we see across the franchise  We reached another all time high with our HIV product sales for both the full year and quarter  For 2019 HIV sales were  16 4 billion  up 12  from 2018  Global HIV sales for Q4 were  4 6 billion  up 9  sequentially and 13  year over year  This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit year over year growth for the franchise US HIV product sales were  3 8 billion in Q4  up 11  sequentially and 12  year over year  The year over year increase was primarily driven by underlying prescription demand growth of 10   Within our prevention market  we re really pleased with the early progress of Descovy for PrEP  which launched in the US in Q4 2019  approximately 27  of individuals on PrEP are now taking Descovy and by Q4 2020  we expect that number will have risen to anywhere between 40  and 45   Across the prevention market  we saw growth of more than 20  in the number of individuals taking PrEP year over year  There are now more than 230 000 people taking one of our HIV prevention medicines in US and this only represents approximately 20  of those who could actually benefit from it Turning to the US HIV treatment market  Biktarvy sales were  1 4 billion in Q4  up 23  sequentially  The market is continuing to consolidate around Biktarvy  which is the number one prescribed HIV regimen in US  And as Dan noted approximately one in two of every naive and switch patients are now initiated on Biktarvy In Europe  Q4 HIV product sales were  562 million  up 1  sequentially and 10  year over year  The year over year growth was driven by the continued strength of our Biktarvy launches in Europe  declining impact of generic launches and unfavorable non recurring pricing and adjustments in Q4 of the prior year  Biktarvy is now available in 29 countries in Europe and it s number one in naive and switch in Germany  France  Spain and now Italy as well Turning to our HCV business  Q4 HCV sales were  630 million  down 7  sequentially and 15  year over year  2019 sales were  2 9 billion for the full year  down 20  primarily due to lower average net selling price and declining patient starts  US revenues for Q4 were  337 million  down 11  sequentially and 18  year over year  In the US  we now have approximately 60  market share with our Gilead branded and authorized generic partner products and are continuing to sustain revenue  In Europe  HCV product sales for Q4 were  151 million  up 36  sequentially and down 20  year over year  The sequential performance was impacted by the seasonality of product sales  Overall  the HCV market continues to see a more predictable decline in patient starts and performs in line with our expectation Before turning to filgotinib  I just wanted to make a few comments on the cardiopulmonary business where we have seen generic competition enter the market early last year  As anticipated significant volume erosion has occurred and as of last December we have seen 90  of erosion of Ranexa    erosion of Ranexa  and 65  erosion of Letairis  a trend that we expect to continue into this year So in closing  I m really excited to share with you a few words about the filgotinib launch  As Dan noted  our teams have now completed regulatory filings for rheumatoid arthritis in US where filgotinib is under priority review as well as in Europe and Japan  In December  we announced a co promotion agreement in Japan with Eisai  It is estimated that approximately 600 000 to a million people in Japan are living with RA and this agreement allows us to draw on the strengths of both companies  with the goal of bringing this important new medicines to those individuals  As you re aware  despite currently available treatment options many patients are still living with symptoms of inadequately controlled RA around the world  In fact  only one out of five patients living with RA achieve complete remission at year one  which means four to five do not  Filgotinib has a compelling and differentiated clinical profile that we believe may uniquely address the significant unmet need for patients with RA  We have highly experienced team preparing for launch later this year and our focus will be on the strength of our data and the compelling risk benefit profile observed across both tested doses of this oral medicine I look forward to working with this great team of people to deliver on the promise of these medicines  And I ll now turn the call over to Merdad Merdad Parsey    Chief Medical OfficerThank you Johanna  And good afternoon everyone  It s been a pleasure to meet some of you over the past few weeks  I m pleased to participate in the first earnings call at Gilead today  I m excited to join the team to extend Gilead story and improve the lives of patients around the world  As we implement our new corporate strategy  I m confident we can leverage our existing pipeline and to expand with internal and external approaches Building on Gilead s impressive innovation in HIV  including the launch of 11 products in 17 years  our goal is to continue to transform the lives of people affected by HIV  Our next wave of HIV innovation will be driven by long acting options for treatment and prevention  We listen to what patients want and we re committed to continuing to pursue and provide more options that meet the needs of people affected by HIV  We believe our capsid inhibitor has the potential for a truly unique profile  offering both oral and subcutaneous dosing  the potential for self administration as well as multiple dosing frequencies and options for HIV treatment and prevention  We recently presented data from two Phase 1 studies demonstrating potent antiviral activity and a potential dosing in a role of up to every six months  We ve initiated Phase II III studies  including one of the    one in heavily treatment experienced patients and we received Breakthrough Therapy designation for this use  The capsid inhibitor will be the foundation of our long acting options and we are exploring multiple partner agents to pair with it As Dan said  we ve set the ambitious goal of bringing 10 transformative medicines to patients over the next decade  The first of these 10 transformative medicines will be filgotinib  which has a potential best in class profile  I ve been impressed with the strength of the filgotinib data and speaking with key opinion leaders  there is real appreciation for the results and an excitement for the potential combination of efficacy and safety of the selective oral JAK1 inhibitor  Across the FINCH studies we ve seen consistently strong efficacy and demonstrate a safety profile that is highly favorable from a benefit risk standpoint  and this is true at both doses tested  We ve now filed for filgotinib in three regions  the US  Europe and Japan  and as Joanna mentioned we are gearing up for the launch Filgotinib has the potential for five new indication launches in the next four years  And we look forward to upcoming ulcerative colitis data this year  This timing could give filgotinib one of the first labels in ulcerative colitis for JAK inhibitor  We have also had    I ve also had the opportunity to meet the Galapagos team and discuss opportunities that are being pursued beyond filgotinib  this remarkable partnership has the potential to double our research footprint as number of programs that could add to our inflammation portfolio Turning to oncology  We have a broad portfolio today including Kite and have a total of 15 clinical stage programs  Our approach is to build transformative therapies across complementary immuno oncology platforms including both cell therapy and non cell therapy  We re actively pursuing and evaluating innovative programs and technologies externally to build our presence in oncology  In total across our current pipeline  we have 40 clinical stage programs  As Dan mentioned of these programs  14 are either being registered right now or in label enabling trials and four of these programs have breakthrough therapy designation  As we pursue external opportunities  we ll continue to build around antiviral therapies  inflammation  fibrosis  and immuno oncology I m excited to work with Dan and the entire Gilead team to expand on the great things that have been done to date and go further for people living with HIV and the patients we serve  This work  internal and external  will enable us to grow in the mid to long term  I look forward to sharing more with all of you about our progress on future calls  Thank you very much And now we ll open the call for questions  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies  Your line is now open Michael Yee    Jefferies    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for the question and thanks for the color on the guidance  I guess I just wanted to ask about your perspective on guidance for 2020 and thinking about both the revenue guidance  which is seemingly flat to down ish versus  19 and EPS  you know when backing out the stock option seems to be flattish to down ish  maybe you can just comment about your perspective of 2020  Is that an investment year  is it potential to be a growth year  both on revenue and EPS  And how do you think about it  of 2020 versus say what you think about  broadly speaking for  21  Thanks Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks a lot Michael for the question  And I would say again based upon the strong results coming off of 2019 that our base business  our HIV business is really robust and continues to grow and of course we need to offset as Andy mentioned in his comments  the full year effect of the cardiopulmonary franchise and just the beginning of the Truvada expiry and we feel confident in our ability to be able to do that  Our guidance reflects revenue that is essentially flat year on year and of course  we ll keep you updated as we go throughout the year based on a variety of events on the commercial side On the investment side  I would say  yes  absolutely  We feel that we need to invest on the commercial side to make sure that we are preparing ourselves well for the most recent launches that have gone out and that s Biktarvy and Descovy  but also well prepare ourselves for a very competitive launch for filgotinib  where you ve heard us say we really think we have a unique medicine  with a best in class profile and we want to make sure  as we know there is only one chance to get a launch right  We want to make sure we re well prepared for that  Now  we have obviously looked hard at our expense base on the commercial side  reallocated resources from cardiopulmonary and are well prepared to put our investments on the growth drivers  And as you can see in our qualitative guidance feel we need to increase slightly from year on year for the SG A guidance Likewise with the investments that we ve made  both in our internal pipeline  the expansion of lifecycle programs around medicines like filgotinib and others  that we need    and including external innovation that we brought in over the past two years  including 33 different collaborations and or acquisitions  We want to make sure we invest appropriately in those to take them to the next decision point and decide about future investment accordingly  And we ll continue to work on that portfolio as we move forward Andy  did you have some other things you wanted to add to that Andrew Dickinson    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  thank you  And Michael  thanks for the question  I would just add two things  Again  as many of you have heard  our primary focus is on building a predictable  sustainable top line growth profile that you would expect to see a company like Gilead so  And that at times requires investment  it has in the history of Gilead as you go back to the Pharmasset acquisition and the investments that were made following that and it will going forward  So that is our primary focus as you know  and then I d also add that we also felt that it was important to provide additional transparency and accuracy in measuring our financial performance and that s why you re seeing additional guidance that helps to give you a fuller picture of how we see the business for the coming year  And I think the guidance speaks for itself and Dan s point were right on Michael Yee    Jefferies    AnalystOkay guys  I appreciate that OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Brian Abrahams    RBC    AnalystHi  there  Thanks so much for taking my question  As you look across your mid stage portfolio and to new corporate strategy  I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the areas of most interest to build out or to wind down  Where do Gilead s team stand today to most optimally take advantage of external opportunities  And how do you guys balance potential versus risk as you look at investing in assets  both internally and externally  Thanks Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Thanks a lot  Brian  I ll start and then I ll ask Merdad to comment on the portfolio  because one of the big efforts that we have under way is with Merdad coming into the organization is breadth of experience in building world class portfolios  That s exactly what he is involved in right now and really leveraging the strengths accordingly across the portfolio  So I d say a couple of things Brian  I think you know as you know we ve kind of elevated the full disclosure and openness on our portfolio  We started at a JPMorgan  you can expect us to continue to be very transparent about the portfolio  the decisions we take and we make  but I think just the very fact that we have 40 clinical stage programs  14 of which are in registrational trials is something that I think maybe under appreciated as we    from the outside Now you asked about what are the things that are most interested in  I m going to let Merdad give that as well  but I ll remind you that our strength in viral diseases will continue to be invested in and that s the discussion around capsid and really truly providing kind of next generation therapies that we think patients and customers  while we know patients and customers are asking for out there  I mean  said that I think the extension of our inflammatory disease portfolio with the Galapagos transaction is something that excites me  I think there s lots of potential shots on goals there  There is ways to think about between Gilead and Galapagos building combination purchase in the future and I think we ve really got a strength in inflammatory diseases that is building Fibrotic disease is something that we have a depth of expertise in and we understand the challenges associated with that disease state  And so as Merdad builds the portfolio  I think he ll comment  we have to make sure that we re putting the right level of investment there that makes sense for the big unmet medical need  but also the risk associated with some of the natures of those diseases  And then finally  there s been significant effort long before Merdad or I joined on oncology  Of course the Kite acquisition provide us with an immediate step up and knowledge and know how and a breadth of portfolio there  but the non Kite portfolio is something that s really built up over the past couple of years  both internally and through our collaborations we know it s early and we know that we re going to have to continue to pursue those programs and build on it  So that s my  0 02  Merdad you have a deeper    kind of a refresh view because you ve just entered  not too long ago  So it d be good to hear your reactions Merdad Parsey    Chief Medical OfficerYeah  and I won t belabor on what Dan said  I think    I think he hit on the main things which is sort of making sure the capsid molecule looks really interesting and I think we re pretty excited about that one and building a partner for that for both treatment and prevention is going to be important goal of ours  And then in inflammation  getting the filgo to launch right and then supplementing filgo    filgotinib in our pipeline is going to be an important task for us to focus on as well to build around the inflammation portfolio and to enable broader reach as we develop there  And then oncology  I think that s an area where we are going to spend time building out looking for opportunities  especially immuno oncology and working with our colleagues at Kite to make sure that we re finding the right balance and bringing the non cell therapy portfolio up to complement the cell based therapy I think more qualitatively maybe I d say  I think what you re hearing is this idea about focus for us  making sure that we re really thoughtful about where we focus and where we build our expertise so that we can build a portfolio around those areas of focus  as you ve heard me and Dan layout  And also that we find a balance to address your other question around risk to find balance around how we approach the overall portfolio so that we have a mix in there of some high risk high reward programs balanced with some other programs that are less risky and have more higher likelihood of success  And so we are going to approach the portfolio that way and broadly across the entire portfolio inclusive of oncology  inflammation  fibrosis and HIV Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Brian  Hope  we got your question Brian Abrahams    RBC    AnalystThanks very much  Thanks  Dan  Thanks Merdad OperatorOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America  Your line is now open Geoff Meacham    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAfternoon guys  Thanks so much for the question  And Andy  thanks for all the clarity on guidance  Johanna  I wanted to ask you a couple on HIV  So the Descovy in PrEP targets  what gets you there to 40   45   And how are you dealing so far with generics to grab share  Then when you look at the Biktarvy franchise  obviously pretty dominating share there  but what populations have you seen of late that are going to continue to add to the    the switched dynamic  I mean  I guess the question is how many of the switches that you ve seen thus far in the US are kind of laggards and maybe where are they re coming from  Thank you very much Johanna Mercier    Chief Commercial OfficerOkay  Thanks Geoff  So maybe I ll hit your Descovy question first and then go to Biktarvy  So we exited the year around 27  with Descovy and what we re seeing is really nice uptake  But if you recall  there is a real segment to market in    the prevention market versus the treatment market  In the treatment market  you have 3 000  4 000 prescribers  In the prevention market  it s much larger than that  like by tenfold  And so  therefore  it s really how do we get there is making sure we focus on the higher volume  which is the same folks that actually are prescribing in prevention are also prescribing in the treatment    HIV treatment world and those are physicians that truly understand the benefits of going from a TDF agent to TAF with all the bone and renal safety that comes with it  And so we believe    that we ve actually seen that share of that segment increased very rapidly  We also have another big piece of the pie that is about 20   25  of the volume that are folks that have never prescribed in HIV treatment  And so these are folks that we are visiting and obviously using different means of communication to make sure they re educated around the fact of the benefits for TAF agents like Descovy and so    so what we re seeing is that increase month to month  and we re very pleased with where we are today  after only three months of launch  Having said that  we believe that s going to continue with some challenges  potentially on the payer side and that s how we get to the 40   45  toward the end of the year in light of the fact that Truvada is losing its patent later this year in October and so some payers are already planning ahead of a little bit on that one  And so we re working with them very closely to make sure that patients get the best most appropriate compound for them  And so I guess we believe that that s where we re going to about 40   45  of conversion by October of this year  So that s the Descovy story From a Biktarvy standpoint  I think  you know what you were saying  good quarter  And I think I would say it s an excellent quarter for Biktarvy  if I do say so myself  I m very proud of the team on that front  and it s been obviously very active  very competitive in the market space as you well know  The Biktarvy is really being used for with the majority of patients and that s really the profile of Biktarvy and what it brings to the table in light of the combination of convenience  tolerability  the high barrier to antiviral resistance  And so that kind of what Biktarvy has to offer  What I would say is  as you think about all the ending the epidemic initiatives  That s were the rapid start with Biktarvy is becoming a really increasingly point of differentiation and very important one for physicians  And I think that s really helping the Biktarvy growth as well as you move forward So the fact that one out of two patients are actually starting on Biktarvy  whether that s a naive patients  or switch patients that is really where you re seeing how the market is consolidating around Biktarvy and we believe that will just continue not only in 2020  but beyond that  just because of what Biktarvy has to offer for patients Hopefully that answered your question  Geoff Geoff Meacham    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVBLeerink  Your line is now open Geoffrey Porges    SVBLeerink    AnalystThank you very much  I appreciate the question  I just wanted if have to ask one about Remdesivir  which is  have there been any other anecdotal reports of responses  other than the one that was in the journal over the weekend  And do you have manufacturing capacity that you could scale up quickly  And then I just wondered if Merdad could talk a little bit about fibrotic disease  You re obviously still involved in NASH  but there are lot of other fibrotic diseases  and I just wonder if you ambition span all fibrotic diseases or still pretty much confined to NASH  Sorry about the double up Merdad Parsey    Chief Medical OfficerThat s alright  Thanks for the question  On Remdesivir  we have not had any other anecdotal reports to date and so we will obviously keep an eye on that very closely and see how that progresses  In terms of manufacturing  our team has really been working night and day  it s been very impressive to watch this team over the past couple of weeks really ramp up to the extent that we can  If our capacity is going up every day  we re looking at all the options we have expecting to be prepared for what may come  Obviously  we are waiting for data both in vitro and then in people to ensure that the drug actually works  But it s important just for everyone to keep that in mind that this is still investigational and we are still waiting for more data to know  but at risk we are investing pretty heavily to make sure that we re prepared as best as we can In terms of fibrotic disease  we think of it fairly broadly  but I guess from my perspective  when I think about fibrotic disease  to your point we NASH as you know we ve had programs and diabetic kidney disease  we have a program in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis right now  And those are biologically related and one of the things that we are always have in our mind is to think about where    where to apply particularly mechanism  which disease to apply particular mechanism and so what I would say as we    as we see the readouts on the IPF study as they come forward as we have the discussions with the agency about the NASH program and as we see novel molecules that come through  we ll do those in a gated way  Fibrosis is a challenging area and we don t underestimate how difficult that s going to be  Hope that address your question Geoffrey Geoffrey Porges    SVBLeerink    AnalystYeah  thank you  Really appreciate it Merdad OperatorOur next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley  your line is now open Matthew Harrison    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Good afternoon  thanks for taking the question  I was hoping you could address what you see is the opportunity in China  you obviously mentioned that for Vemlidy and then pointed out some of your HCV medicines are approved there  but I don t think you ve talked about how big you think that could be your    how much of a contributor  you think that could be over the next couple of years  Thanks Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Matty  We ll have Johanna address that  Thanks Johanna Mercier    Chief Commercial OfficerSo in China we re excited about the fact that this is really our first opportunity with reimbursed compounds  So I think Dan mentioned which one  but just to highlight  From a hepatitis C standpoint  it s Harvoni and Epclusa and the only other product  this was a tender process in China  and the only other product approved is  Indecipherable   reimbursed I should say  And so  I mean of course  this is more of a volume opportunity than anything else  And this is one that we believe many patients are in need  And we have a real opportunity to help those patients  That s in hepatitis C In hepatitis B  Vemlidy also got reimbursement  which of course as you know for hepatitis B biggest market from a patient standpoint is also in China  And then the last one is Genvoya in HIV  which HIV is going to be the first time that actually products will get reimbursed in China  in HIV the class  And so we believe that s also one that we re cautiously optimistic that more patients can really get better treatment that they need  So  we are cautiously optimistic about our China business opportunity  you can appreciate that with everything going on right now in China  the focus is not on some of these new products that got reimbursement  the focus is really on the people and what s going on with the Coronavirus  And so we do think that might be a little bit delayed in 2020 as we see kind of that play out  but I do think from a longer term standpoint this is how we should be thinking about China and the opportunity moving forward  because of the patient pool that is so predominant in the specific disease areas that we offer potential solutions for patients Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think that s great  Matthew  The only other thing I would say  Joanna has captured really well is that we kind of put this into the durable base part of our strategic story and I think that s because it is a volume game  I think there is real opportunity here obviously for patients in China  but also for our business  but it helps us kind of stabilize and navigate that durable base over the course of the years to come  And it s important for patients and also for our business to build out  And then we have the inflection points on top of that  you know with Yescarta  Phonetic  business with filgotinib  with a variety of things that are in our hands right now and a larger portfolio to inflect for the    for it to provide our confidence in the mid to long term growth  Thanks OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI  Your line is now open Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  thanks so much for taking my question  Perhaps  First one for Johanna  Johanna  I know you worked in    in your prior role you headed a commercial organization  which was best in class in oncology and a very established organization in primary care with Eliquis  And my question to you is  as you look at Gilead where it stands today how prepared is the organization to compete with AbbVie and Pfizer  two companies very well entrenched in their    with their Jack s respectively  I m just trying to understand the level of organizational preparedness especially in light of which I think is probably something like  200 million plus or minus the year over year incremental SG A expense possibly heading into the filgotinib launch And one for Merdad  I know the filgotinib UC  Phonetic  trial selection one is due any day  I also understand that there is inadequate responders to Entyvio in there  So  those patients in particular  what percentage is that of the trial  And do you expect filgotinib to be active in Entyvio non responders  Thank you Johanna Mercier    Chief Commercial OfficerSo maybe I ll kick it off Umer  with your first part of your question  So specific to filgotinib  I think that you re right  obviously we are very well aware that it s going to be a very competitive environment  There s no doubt about that  but I think we re being really smart about it  And what I mean by that is because I think what we re thinking about is making sure where we re going to bring focus to the table  So we are going to be  we are very clear about where we want to play and where we play we win and that s about commercial excellence and medical excellence  to be honest with you  because  medical and commercial  we need to partner very closely and we are already around the clinical data and the profile of this compound  and how that really needs to be at the center of everything we do with filgotinib I would also say that you know if I take other disease areas  where we had similar competitive dynamics and similar competitors to be honest  we have done  actually quite well in that space and HCV is a great example of that where we ve regained share and now we re at 60  share in HCV across the marketplace  which I do think shows others including internally and externally that we can be very competitive when we need to be and I think that s exactly what you re going to see with filgotinib We are preparing the teams  We are making sure that we are hiring the right people and with the right level of experiences to making sure that we are absolutely ready for an expected launch later this year  And I think that I m really excited about it  to be honest with you  I think the team has really come up the line and I think we brought in some really good external talent  but we already had some very good internal talent as well and building the two together  I think will make for a very successful launch moving forward Merdad Parsey    Chief Medical OfficerAnd yeah  and so this is Merdad  maybe I ll start by clarifying the timing because I think you may have given my team a heart attack  I don t think it s any day now  I think we ve got it to a little bit later in the first half of the year  So please be patient with us as well  We ll get it out there as quickly as we can  In terms of the Entyvio non responders  you know I won t know the precise proportion until after we see the demography of the study  afterwards  after the trial has done  So I m not going to    I d be speculating as to sort of where we land on that  So I m going to beg your patience on that one as well But in terms of expectations of response  I think if you look at this    this population as you know they cycle through a variety of medications  And while the response rate when they cycle to the next medication isn t usually as robust as a naive patient there are good    there is good evidence that going from  let s say Entyvio to a TNF inhibitor or vice versa you have  you still have a good proportion of patients who respond in that  So I think our expectations are fairly realistic about what the respond    that we ll have responders in there to filgotinib Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you very much OperatorOur next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan  Your line is now open Cory Kasimov    JPMorgan    AnalystHey  good afternoon guys  Thanks for taking the question  Wanted to ask you on the corporate strategy front  With everyone is pretty clearly waiting for the company to engage in more substantial business development  but how much of a sense of urgency do you have on this front given kind of the new management team  all coming together now and how successful do you think Gilead can be without outside help basically relying on the first two pillars of your strategy Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks Corey  I ll give a start and if Andy wants to add as well  So look  I think you know  first of all  I believe we re coming at this from a position of strength  The position of strength now that we have a complete management time    team with depth of experience  Of course  we re still building experience in some of our new therapeutic areas  but we have now a team that is accomplished that understands what good looks like  that understands how to take appropriate risk and then that s relatively recent that we have this team together like this  So  it allows us  if you like when we look at external opportunities in our areas of expertise  which is not unimportant because we really decided to focus there  I think it allows us to move fast and we know that moving fast is important and being first to the table at the right time in some cases that s more risks  in some cases that s less risk  depending on the nature of what we re looking at  but I think we re well prepared to be able to pivot    to be first at the table or close to first at the table and to make things happen So we have a solid pipeline  but we have a sense of urgency of course around building this and I think we ve been clear about the areas we intend to build in  We will also be disciplined  We re not going to    we re going to take    we re going to take appropriate risks  but I think risk that will help us build the shape of the portfolio very much like Merdad mentioned before  And we ll take that into account to  So it s not just about an individual target or asset  it s also about how that fits into the complementary nature of that therapeutic area and or other therapeutic areas and that s where we ll pivot and move with  But rest assured  our sense of urgency around is high  but so is our expertise I would say as well  Andy  did you want to add to that Andrew Dickinson    Chief Financial OfficerI mean  the only thing I would add  I agree that there is a sense of urgency  we will be disciplined  I d say to some extent Cory the best proxy is just looking at the past couple of years  I mean we ve outperformed commercially the last two years  we ve given very clear guidance for 2020 obviously  we will work incredibly hard to outperform again we see opportunities  things that we can potentially do better  we would like to find external assets to supplement our pipeline  but we also feel that the durability of our existing business and our existing pipeline are both under appreciated So to answer your second question on can we compete without doing large business development deals  Absolutely  I mean    and we think that we can continue to build a sustainable business  Would we like to supplement it with outside assets especially to build our late stage pipeline  Yes  And we are actively working on that  but to reiterate what Dan said we re going to be thoughtful and disciplined in how we do it Cory Kasimov    JPMorgan    AnalystAll right  That s helpful  thanks guys Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Cory OperatorOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Citi  Your line is now open Mohit Bansal    Citi    AnalystGreat  thanks for taking my question  And if you could talk a little bit about the market opportunity with the capsid inhibitor  especially in  Indecipherable  should we think about this as an incremental opportunity or do you think the portion of it could be from existing in that product  Thank you Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCapsid inhibitor Johanna Mercier    Chief Commercial OfficerSo I think you know I can touch on it from a commercial standpoint and then maybe pass it over to Diana to touch a little bit more on its clinical profile and its offerings  From a commercial standpoint  we re thinking about the capsid in two ways  one in prevention and the other one in treatment obviously  we think there is probably an opportunity we ll see  to see if there is monotherapy and prevention and potentially    obviously we re looking for combination in the treatment  And Diana can touch on that a little bit more  In prevention  I do think with Descovy right now in prevention and the launch of what s going on  we do think that probably going to be something that could be very interesting for patients  If you think about that marketplace and thinking potentially up to six months  and that s really what patients are looking forward to have something every six months  This could be something very interesting and exciting for patients and that would be with the timing that we re thinking about for this compound  assuming all plays out then it could be actually more of a switch in the prevention market from Descovy to the capsid inhibitor Having said that in treatment that we could look very different  And I do think that s potentially a market expansion  because it would really be  if we can find combination that would really work in the treatment setting  I do think that would offer a long acting that patients actually really want and that s the biggest piece of the puzzle  What we re trying to do is making sure that we match up what the patients are telling us with our clinical development plan  And what I mean by that is as we ve done so much market research with our patient pool what they re telling us is yes  weekly oral would be interesting and potentially something that they might be interested over a daily compound  but it s not for everyone  And then when you go from weekly oral to potentially what else would they want  a rather an injectable to subcu  subcu wins out  if they d rather three months and six months  six months wins out  And so that s really where we have focused our clinical development team to make sure that we re addressing the needs of patients  And maybe with that  I ll turn it over to Diana Diana Brainard    Senior Vice President and Head of HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic AreaYeah  we recognize the bar is very high because Biktarvy as really set the standard  but we also know that within the US  for example  only 85  of people with HIV are in treatment  And if we want to end the epidemic  we have to do better and the capsid inhibitor is going to be one of those tools  And we really see it as Johanna was saying as a market expander because one of the reasons that those people aren t in treatment is that the treatments right now are not amenable to their lifestyles  And so long acting is a way to make the umbrella a little bit larger  it s a complement to Biktarvy and what we have already Mohit Bansal    Citi    AnalystThat s helpful  thanks OperatorOur next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald  Your line is now open Alethia Young    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my question  I just wanted to ask maybe perhaps Dan and Merdad  about the    Merdad  sorry  about the NASH and hep B space  I mean I know it s one that s been pretty tough in clinical side  but obviously there s a lot of leverage to your business  since you have the sales force in place  So I guess I m just try to figure out what you guys kind of think about that going forward over the next 12 months  Thanks Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Merdad  do you want to    Merdad Parsey    Chief Medical OfficerYeah  sure happy to  Yeah  thanks  Thanks Alethia  Yeah  for NASH  I think we definitely are working hard on the results from the ATLAS trial and we ll be    we ll be talking with the regulators and looking to see what the path forward is  As you said    Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerData will be published at EASL  Speech Overlap Merdad Parsey    Chief Medical OfficerExactly  So in April we ll show the data to everyone in April at EASL and where    we have plans for sort of mid year discussion with the agency to sort of see if there is a path forward and what that might look like and make a decision based on  based on those discussions  Just a reminder that we ve been studying more HEP3 and HEP4 patients  the more severe patients than our    than most of the other competition has where they re looking at the milder patient populations  The HEP1s to HEP3s  HEP2s and HEP3s sorry  primarily  So it does pose some unique challenges  so we will continue to work there And I think that I would say the same thing for HCV  right  I think it s a HCV is a bit different in that it is a core part of our business  we have    we have therapies  We have a sales force to your    to your point on that  we re continuing to be committed to that space and working there  Our focus is on a cure  we have ongoing work with a number of programs to try to hit our move from where we are today in treatment to moving toward a cure that s going to be a challenging road  but we re committed to it and continue to work there Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think I couldn t agree more with Merdad s view  And the only thing I d maybe add to that Alethia is just to say the particularly in Hep B we understand at the end of the day  this is going to take partnerships  So we have to decide what do we do internally  what do we do with partners  cures significantly more difficult than treatment in this area  And so I think that gets back into some of the comments that both Merdad and I had around how much do we invest in ourselves  how much do you do with partnerships  what percentage of our total investment goes into these very  very important unmet medical needs and making sure that we also invest appropriately in other areas that we know have even greater realization potential that also have big unmet medical need  So that balance will continue to play out  The reality is we have very good expertise in both these diseases and I think we ll be able to make good decisions Alethia Young    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystGreat  thank you Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho  Your line is now open Salim Syed    Mizuho    AnalystHey  thanks so much guys for taking my question  And appreciate all the color on the guidance  Andy  Just one from me on  on sort of the long term picture here  and I m not asking for a long term guidance  maybe this is for Dan or Andy  obviously you guys provided a lot of color  Johanna you mentioned Biktarvy majority of patients through 2023  Phonetic   I mean  you guys seem relatively excited about what you have currently in the pipeline with filgotinib etc  But consensus has you modeled that  22 billion sort of flattish for the next few years  do you need M A to grow your top line or do you think you can grow your top line without any additional M A  Thanks so much Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks Salim and certainly have others come in here as well  But look  I think as we ve    as we tried to build the story and as I ve come to investigate the story and some of the other colleagues around the table  I think the first answer to your question is how durable is our base business  because I think that has a very different    depending on how durable you feel it is that has a very different perspective on our confidence around the mid to long term growth  So I think we ve talked quite a bit about this  we feel very confident with the durability of our base business and this is different  by the way compared to a lot of companies in the industry  Yes  we have  as you know from our guidance we are issuing today  we ve got    we ve got some patent expiry to deal with this year and some patent expiry to deal with next year in terms of Truvada  but then as you look out in terms of time  we feel well prepared for the Descovy patent expiry in  25   26 and basically then have a very durable franchise out until 2033 so  So that s the first part of the answer into the story Then we do feel that we have growth engines internally and that s exactly why we ve tried to highlight them a bit more  give you exposure to them  be transparent about it  but also be very clear about where those inflection points are  Things that we have in our hands today  And of course some of the obvious ones you know we have on the plate with things like ulcerative colitis potentially reading out this year  second line DLBCL  capsid inhibitor coming next year  but we didn t talk about a variety of things that are coming through the Galapagos pipeline that also have optionality for us  if you like  and that s osteoarthritis the Phase 2 will come through this year and then we ll have an IPF interim next year  So there are a variety of things in our hands including other collaborations  I m not speaking out here today that are in Phase ones or label enabling Phase twos that are going to read out  And we ve given you all the exposure to the pipeline and portfolio So can we grow based upon what we have in house  Yes  I m confident we can  And I also believe that we re going to supplement that and derisk that over time  but we re going to continue to do it in the way that you ve seen us do that with proper partnerships and proper M A transactions to get to a portfolio strength that s even more obvious to everybody and even more reliable and that s going to take some time to build that and to grow it  but we are firmly committed to do that  We have the resources to be able to do it  I mean  that s what I would say  Andy  would you    Andrew Dickinson    Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think that s perfect  I don t have anything else to add Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Does that help Salim Salim Syed    Mizuho    AnalystYeah  that s super helpful  Thanks so much guys Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen   Company  Your line is now open Phil Nadeau    Cowen   Company    AnalystGood afternoon  Thanks for fitting me in  One question for Andy on the 2020 guidance  just kind of maybe three moving parts that weren t mentioned on slide 25 and I was just curious to get your thoughts on whether these will materially impact revenue in 2020  So positive side  first is filgotinib  any expectations for filgotinib revenue contemplated in your guidance  And then maybe as potential headwinds in HIV  the nucleotide bearing regimens are launching  any expectation for those to gain share through the course of the year  And on HCV price has been deteriorating over the last couple of years and expectations for further declines in price again contemplated in your guidance  Thank you Andrew Dickinson    Chief Financial OfficerYeah at a high level and Johanna may want to comment on the HIV headwinds  And filgo there is limited contribution in 2020 as you d expect given the projected launch dates  So there potential upside there  if that develops  We think and spend a lot of time in the HIV market  So as you might expect our expectations for the competitive dynamic in the HIV market are built into our guidance  And then in the HCV space  We do expect there to be continued price pressure in the HCV space  If you see from the third quarter to the fourth quarter  if you look at our slides  the number of patients that were treated actually went up  Nonetheless  revenues are down given kind of the dynamic in that in that space  So obviously it s a smaller  speaking of HCV  it is a smaller piece of our business  but we    our guidance assumes continued decrease in that business over time  But it s still an important business for us  It generates a lot of cash flow and on a percentage basis although the increase is the same on a dollar basis  it s less than year over year  I mean at some point it may stabilize  but that s how I would think about it Phil at a high level  I don t know if Johanna  if you want to add anything Johanna Mercier    Chief Commercial OfficerI m totally in line with what you said  I would just add from HCV standpoint  the only thing I would add to that is it is just so much more predictable today than it was  And so    and the declines are much  much softer and so what you re going to see is still continued price erosion across US and Europe and the patient starts are a little bit less every single quarter  but having said that  it s nothing like what we ve seen in the past  So  I think much more predictable marketplace for us  In HIV  I think we have had some of those I guess headwinds  as you say from a competitor standpoint mid last year I guess or so when competition came into the marketplace  And we have been able to manage that extremely well and with very limited impact to Biktarvy and its growth trajectory  And so  we believe the same will continue throughout 2020 Phil Nadeau    Cowen   Company    AnalystThat s helpful  Thank you Daniel O Day    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  I think that s the end of our call today Douglas

200604,422120,GILD,StockBeat  Markets Surge on Hints of  Virus Drugs  Smurfit  Vestas Soar,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    Stock markets pushed sharply higher on Wednesday on the back of reports that scientists in China and Europe had made significant breakthroughs in developing drugs to treat the novel coronavirus outbreak 
Business surveys showing that better than expected levels of activity in the eurozone economy aslo helped  strong services readings helped IHS Markit s eurozone composite purchasing managers  index to its highest level in five months  the increase to 51 3 beating forecasts for an unchanged reading of 50 9 
The news came as a relief to markets that had been pricing in a sharp drop in Chinese economic output at least in the first quarter of this year  along with the threat of reverberations throughout the world economy   
China accounts for nearly 20  of world gross domestic product  and the implications of the outbreak on Chinese demand have sent the prices of commodities such as oil and copper into freefall  a fall that had only been broken by large scale liquidity injections by the Chinese central bank earlier in the week 
By 5 15 AM ET  1015 GMT   the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 1 0  at 422 58  The German DAX was up 1 1  while the FTSE 100 was up 0 7   All three were off earlier highs as the initial spike in response to the news faded 
One of the reports was sourced to Sky News  which claimed a team of researchers at Imperial College London would begin testing a quickly developed drug on animals next week  Reuters also sourced a Chinese television report saying that researchers in Zhejiang had developed a drug capable of treating the coronavirus effectively  However  those claims weren t visible on any international editions of Chinese state media 
On Tuesday  a research institute had applied for a local patent on the antiviral drug remdesivir developed by Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   which has also been used with success on coronavirus patients in the U S   The drug hasn t yet received approval from U S  regulators  however 
The news rather overshadowed a flood of earnings from Europe s blue chips on Wednesday  which were a mixed bag  Siemens  a traditional bellwether for European manufacturing  underperformed with a 1 0  rise after reporting a slump in margins across all of its businesses  while chipmaker Infineon surged 8 0  after reporting a better than expected fourth quarter report and upbeat guidance

200605,422121,GILD,3 Important Things to Know About Gilead Sciences  Q4 Results,news,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  made headlines in recent days after the company announced that it was working with Chinese authorities to test its Ebola drug remdesivir in treating the deadly coronavirus strain that has become an epidemic  But that wasn t the biggest news for Gilead this week 
The big biotech reported its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results after the market closed on Tuesday  Here are three important things to know about Gilead s Q4 update 

1  Better than expected revenue
Gilead endured a long stretch where its revenue declined quarter after quarter  That wasn t the case in Q4  though  The company reported Q4 revenue of  5 9 billion  up from  5 8 billion in the prior year period  This result even topped the consensus Wall Street revenue estimate of  5 71 billion 
Sure  Gilead s hepatitis C virus  HCV  franchise continued to weigh on the company s total revenue  HCV sales fell nearly 19  year over year in the fourth quarter to  630 million  But the quarter over quarter decline of only 6 5  wasn t too bad considering what Gilead has experienced in the past 
The biggest bright spot for Gilead yet again was its HIV franchise  HIV sales jumped 12  year over year in Q4 to  4 6 billion  with Biktarvy leading the way with sales of  1 57 billion  Although Descovy was the only other HIV drug in Gilead s lineup to deliver sales growth  the combination of it and Biktarvy were more than enough to offset declining sales for Truvada  Genvoya  and other HIV drugs 
Yescarta didn t pick up much momentum in Q4  though  Sales rose nearly 51  year over year in the fourth quarter to  122 million  but that was only slightly above the  118 million recorded in the third quarter 
2  A big earnings miss
While Gilead topped Wall Street s Q4 revenue estimate  it was a different story on the bottom line  The biotech posted adjusted earnings of  1 7 billion  or  1 30 per diluted share  This result was lower than the  1 9 billion  or  1 44 per diluted share  generated in the prior year period  It was also well below the average analysts  Q4 earnings estimate of  1 67 per share 
Gilead s earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  looked much better  though  The company reported GAAP earnings of  2 7 billion  or  2 12 per share  up significantly from GAAP earnings of only  3 million in the prior year period  However  this big improvement stemmed mainly from some positive tax effects from accounting moves related to asset transfers and net gains from equity securities 
Analysts probably weren t too bothered by Gilead s big adjusted earnings miss  It s possible that they didn t factor in some of the company s acquisition related expenses 
3  Lackluster 2020 guidance
Gilead provided what could be described as lackluster full year 2020 guidance  The company projects product sales to be between  21 8 billion and  22 billion  The midpoint of that range is lower than the  22 1 billion in product sales generated in the full year 2019 
Non GAAP adjusted earnings per share  EPS  for full year 2020 are expected to be between  6 05 and  6 45  The midpoint of this range is well below the consensus Wall Street adjusted EPS estimate for 2020 of  7 01 
At first glance  it might also appear that Gilead s adjusted EPS will decline from its full year 2019 level  However  beginning this year  the company isn t excluding stock based compensation expense from its non GAAP figures  On an apples to apples basis  Gilead s adjusted EPS outlook for 2020 reflects a year over year increase of 2  at the midpoint of the guidance range 
The bigger picture
If I had to sum up Gilead s fourth quarter results in one word  it would probably be  blah   There simply was nothing in the company s update to excite investors 
However  pipelines are more important to the prospects for biotech stocks than past quarterly results  Gilead could generate more excitement later this year if it wins FDA approval for immunology drug filgotinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis  RA   Some analysts think filgotinib could achieve peak annual sales in the ballpark of  6 billion if approved for RA and other targeted immunology indications 
Gilead also ended 2019 with cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities totaling  25 8 billion  That s a big cash stockpile the company could use to bolster its pipeline  The company is also putting its ample cash flow to use in another way that should delight investors    its dividend  Gilead announced an 8  dividend increase beginning in the first quarter of 2020 ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prcyy,2076559
200606,422122,GILD,Gilead Sciences  Patience Required,news,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  reported fourth quarter and full year results after the closing bell Tuesday  Investors were none too pleased with the big biotech s financial results or near term outlook  Immediately after disclosing its latest financial figures  Gilead s shares dropped 1 68  in after hours trading yesterday 
What s ruffling the feathers of shareholders  The core issue is Gilead s anemic top line guidance for 2020  Despite years of promising to boost sales by bringing new drugs to market  the biotech is essentially calling for revenue to slightly dip this year  
The underlying problem is that Gilead simply hasn t had much luck with the progress of its internal clinical pipeline outside of HIV and cell based cancer therapies  Last year  for instance  the biotech s nonalcoholic steatohepatitis pipeline basically went belly up  putting it well behind the front runners in the space  

Despite all this doom and gloom  Gilead s shares actually look like a buy on the heels of this latest pullback  Here s why bargain hunters might want to consider buying this underperforming large cap biotech stock soon 
Reasons for optimism
Even though Gilead s hepatitis C franchise continues to be a drag on its top line  newer products like the groundbreaking HIV treatment Biktarvy and novel anti cancer therapy Yescarta have been pulling their weight in recent quarters  Biktarvy  for instance  hauled in a whopping  1 6 billion in Q4  and Yescarta posted a respectable  122 million for the three month period  These two therapies have kept Gilead s top line afloat while its clinical pipeline and various business development activities slowly take shape   
While Gilead s homegrown pipeline candidates and recent acquisitions haven t yielded much in the way of new products lately  its external pipeline development efforts have been an unmitigated success  The biotech s sizable equity stake in Galapagos brought in the promising anti inflammatory medication filgotinib  which should eventually reach megablockbuster status  more than  5 billion in annual sales   Filgotinib  in fact  should play a central role in the biotech s growth prospects for the better part of the current decade  
Gilead s enormous cash position of  25 8 billion gives it plenty of firepower for external licensing deals  as well as small to midsize bolt on acquisitions  Keeping with this theme  the company has already stated that it will start to beef up its pipeline through licensing deals and a handful of acquisitions soon  And if any of these deals bring in another filgotinib  Gilead should be able to quickly accelerate its return to modest levels of top line growth  
Finally  Gilead has one of the best shareholder rewards programs in the entire healthcare sector  The biotech has consistently raised its dividend over the past five years  and it has literally plowed billions into share buybacks as well  As things stand now  Gilead offers a forward looking annualized yield of 3 94   That s well above the prevailing average for its large cap biotech peer group 
Time to buy 
To be frank  Gilead s stock probably isn t going to do much in 2020  Until the biotech s top line perks up  its shares will almost certainly underperform the broader biopharma industry  That said  Gilead s new management team appears intent on changing this narrative soon  Filgotinib is close to its first regulatory approval  Gilead s cell therapy subsidiary  Kite Pharma  should have its second product on the market soon with Kite X19  and the company also has a sizable war chest to spend on M A 
Bottom line  Gilead s stock has likely reached a nadir In fact  the stage is now set for the biotech to return to high growth status as soon as next year  So even though patience will definitely be required on the part of shareholders in 2020  it may indeed be time for growth investors to circle back to this name ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prhm4,2076928

200616,422132,GILD,Gilead s Ebola Drug Shows Positive Signs in Treating Coronavirus,news,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  shot up as much as 13  on the news that its failed Ebola drug  remdesivir  showed promising initial signs of helping patients with the coronavirus  In an official statement before the weekend  the company announced it was working together with U S  and Chinese health regulators to see whether remdesivir could improve patient symptoms  
The company stated that remdesivir saw some success in treating patients with SARS and MERS  two other viruses with similarities with the coronavirus when tested in animals  Remdesivir was also tested on one U S  coronavirus patient prior to the weekend  who showed an impressive improvement in symptoms following a single dose 

The New England Journal of Medicine reported that a U S  patient received a dose of remdesivir from doctors on a compassionate use basis  Whereas the patient had been showing signs of pneumonia  fever  and required supplemental oxygen  after remdesivir was given  all symptoms disappeared except for a cough and mucus buildup in the nasal cavity  rhinorrhea  
Further details
While impressive  further clinical tests need to be performed before Gilead s remdesivir can be recommended for widespread coronavirus treatment  Other pharmaceutical giants are also hoping to develop a treatment  with Johnson   Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline working on their own vaccines  AbbVie stated it saw positive results by mixing two HIV medications with another drug called Tamiflu 
However  the biggest winners over the past few weeks have been small cap specialty vaccine producers  Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals have seen substantial swings in their stock prices as the coronavirus continues to spread  There are now 362 confirmed deaths from the outbreak so far ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqltf,2074960
200617,422133,GILD,Here s a Better Reason to Buy Gilead Sciences Stock Than a Possible Coronavirus Treatment,news,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  just might have moved into the pole position in the race to fight the coronavirus  On Friday  the big biotech announced that it s working with Chinese authorities on a clinical trial to evaluate remdesivir  which was unsuccessful as a treatment for Ebola  in treating the 2019 nCoV coronavirus strain that has caused serious health concerns throughout the world 
Remdesivir has previously demonstrated potential against MERS and SARS  two other coronaviruses that are similar in structure to 2019 nCoV  A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week reported that a man in Washington state with the coronavirus strain experienced improvement after being treated with Gilead s experimental drug 
Optimism about remdesivir fueled investors  excitement on Monday  sending Gilead s shares as much as 8 7  higher during the day  But there s an even better reason to consider buying Gilead stock now than its prospects for treating the coronavirus 

More important to Gilead s future
Perhaps the best reason to buy Gilead Sciences shares right now is the potential for the immunology drug filgotinib  There s no question that it s more important to Gilead s future than remdesivir is 
For one thing  filgotinib has already been evaluated in multiple late stage clinical studies as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis  and demonstrated both efficacy and safety  Gilead is currently waiting for regulators in the U S   the EU  and Japan to hand down their decisions on it  By contrast  though remdesivir has shown promise as a possible treatment for coronavirus  there s no guarantee that it will be successful in clinical trials  
Then there are the drugs  relative market sizes  More than 1 3 million Americans have rheumatoid arthritis  as do up to 1  of the world s population    around 78 million people in all  And as the size of the senior adult population grows across the world  the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis will climb since the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age 
Compare those numbers to what has been seen so far with the coronavirus  As of Feb  3  there were 17 391 confirmed cases of the virus  with more than 99  of them in China  according to the World Health Organization  WHO   The number of deaths resulting from the coronavirus 2019 nCoV strain totaled 361  with 360 of them in China 
Those are worrisome statistics  to be sure  as the number of confirmed infections is growing at an alarming rate  However  there are plenty of other diseases    including rheumatoid arthritis    that have greater health impacts globally  and which still would even if 2019 nCoV spreads significantly further 
Great expectations
There have been other coronavirus outbreaks in the past  SARS  severe acute respiratory syndrome  emerged in 2003  MERS  Middle East respiratory syndrome   made headlines in 2012  But despite initial concerns  no vaccine or antiviral drug has been approved for either virus strain  
Perhaps Gilead will make a lot of money if remdesivir proves to be effective at treating 2019 nCoV  But based on the past  there appears to be a good chance that worries will die down after this virus strain runs its course 
Meanwhile  analysts think that filgotinib will generate peak annual sales of around  3 billion in treating rheumatoid arthritis  Gilead is also evaluating the drug in several other autoimmune indications  including Crohn s disease  psoriatic arthritis  and ulcerative colitis  If filgotinib wins approval for all of those indications  it could rack up another  3 billion in annual sales 
Gilead liked the prospects for filgotinib so much that it spent  5 1 billion last year to expand its partnership with Galapagos  the biotech that initially developed it  Prior to this deal  Gilead owned the license to commercialize filgotinib  Now  the company also has an exclusive license and options rights to develop and commercialize all of Galapagos  programs everywhere outside of Europe 
More pipeline prospects
Biotech stocks rise and fall on the prospects for their pipelines  As promising as Gilead s potential coronavirus treatment may be  filgotinib is clearly the crown jewel for right now  And there are more candidates potentially on the way that make Gilead appear even more attractive 
The company has multiple phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies underway evaluating cell therapies to treat blood cancers  One analyst thinks that experimental long acting HIV drug GS 6207  which is currently in early stage clinical testing  could eventually be Gilead s biggest winner of all  Regardless of what happens with the company s efforts to treat this coronavirus strain  the big biotech s pipeline makes it worth a serious look for long term investors ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqvr8,2075377

The biotech giant reported fourth quarter revenues of  5 88 billion  which is a 1  increase from last year  while earnings per share fell to  1 30 per share in comparison to the  1 44 reported in Q4 2018  or a 9 8  decline  Although Gilead outperformed on the  5 7 billion revenue target analysts were expecting  the biotech giant fell significantly short of the  1 67 EPS target Wall Street was anticipating

200620,422136,GILD,Gilead Sciences  GILD  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This HIV and hepatitis C drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 7  
Revenues are expected to be  5 71 billion  down 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 89  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gilead 
For Gilead  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 35  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Gilead will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Gilead would post earnings of  1 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 75  delivering a surprise of  0 57  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

200632,422148,GILD,Why Gilead Sciences Stock Is Up 13  Today,news,"What happened
Biotech blue blood Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  saw its shares jump by as much as 13  in pre market action Monday morning  The stock perked up in response to a research agreement with Chinese authorities to begin a clinical trial of the antiviral medication remdesivir in patients infected with the novel coronavirus known as 2019 nCoV  The trial will reportedly take place in Wuhan  China  the epicenter of the current outbreak  
So what
The coronavirus has already killed 361 individuals  based on the latest figures from the World Health Organization  And it has quickly spread from China to neighboring Asia Pacific nations  North America  Europe  and the Middle East  If a viable treatment isn t identified soon  the death toll from this unique respiratory disease could skyrocket in the coming weeks 

In fact  the challenging circumstances developing in Wuhan might be skewing the actual infection rates by health authorities in the region  Put simply  this outbreak might actually be far worse than current estimates suggest  What this all means is that health authorities in China and elsewhere may be forced to take extraordinary measures soon  such as approving novel treatments like Gilead s antiviral remdesivir in record time   
Now what
Should investors take advantage of this rapidly developing healthcare story  While there s a growing chance that this may in fact be a boon for one or more biotechs at the end of the day  it s still a long shot  Gilead  or any other coronavirus player for that matter  is highly unlikely to get a marketing approval for a coronavirus treatment before the outbreak simply peters out  In short  this breaking news story is not a solid reason to buy this top biotech stock today ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqgk8,2074523
200633,422149,GILD,GILD Or EXEL  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector have probably already heard of Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  and Exelixis  EXEL   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Gilead Sciences and Exelixis are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that GILD has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
GILD currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 02  while EXEL has a forward P E of 35 12  We also note that GILD has a PEG ratio of 3 69  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  EXEL currently has a PEG ratio of 4 28 
Another notable valuation metric for GILD is its P B ratio of 3 86  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  EXEL has a P B of 3 87 
Based on these metrics and many more  GILD holds a Value grade of A  while EXEL has a Value grade of C 
GILD is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that GILD is likely the superior value option right now ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gild-or-exel-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200499741,200499741

 Gilead is in active discussions with researchers and clinicians in the United States and China regarding the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus outbreak and the potential use of remdesivir as an investigational treatment   said a company spokesperson in an emailed statement according to Reuters

In a recently filed motion  Bristol Myers asked a federal judge in California to include punitive damages that would raise Gilead s penalty to  1 5 billion to include punitive damages along with compensation and a royalty rate of 27 6  on Yescarta sales  
 

Bristol Myers Squibb s argument 
According to Bristol Myers  the Kite Pharma subsidiary that Gilead acquired for  11 9 billion in 2017 willfully infringed on patents that Juno Therapeutics licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  While  752 million is a princely sum  it only covers the amount Juno might have received if Kite had agreed on a licensing arrangement for the patent Yescarta infringed upon 
Bristol Myers  would like to see Gilead pay punitive damages equal to the compensation already owed because the jury s verdict shows that Kite  and later Gilead knew Yescarta would infringe and avoided striking a costly deal with Juno and Sloan 
Gilead s defense
Gilead s subsidiary has requested a do over because it wasn t allowed sufficient time to prepare its full case to the jury and the list of grievances continues to pile up  
Kite claims the patent at the heart of the argument lacked adequate written description and enablement  Kite also wants to argue that the patent involved claims more chimeric antigen receptors than Sloan and Juno actually invented ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmj64,2067452
200644,422160,GILD,Near a 7 Year Low  Is Gilead Sciences a Buy ,news,"Buying a stock near its low can be a good way to lock in a low price and hopefully set yourself up for some stronger returns later on  In the case of Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   the stock isn t just at a 52 week low    it s trading at around the lowest it has been in seven years  While the stock has occasionally dipped lower than the  63 that it trades at today  the last time that the stock was below that mark for an extended period of time was back in 2013 when it was on its way up 
Over the past year  Gilead s stock has declined by 7   even as the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has risen 17   It may be tempting to believe that Gilead has bottomed out and it s due for a rally  But it s important to first understand why the stock is struggling as badly as it is  whether it can recover  and whether the stock is a good value at its current price  or if it is only likely to decline further 
Profits and sales have been falling    fast
It s no big mystery why Gilead is struggling  The company just isn t producing the results that it once did  In 2018  sales of  22 1 billion were down more than 27  from the  30 4 billion that Gilead reported in 2016  Its margins have been shrinking as well  Through 2014 to 2016  Gilead s net profit margin didn t fall below 40   but in 2018 it was only 25     which was still an improvement from 18  the year before 

The company s product sales were down 14  in 2017 and then 16  again in 2018  Although HIV drug sales increased  2 9 billion during that time   that s not enough to offset the losses from Harvoni  Sales from the Hepatitis C drug totaled just  1 2 billion in 2018  and that s down nearly  8 billion from the  9 1 billion in revenue it generated in 2016  Gilead now offers a generic  lower priced drug for patients with Hepatitis C which will help keep sales going  but at a much lower pace  That means the company is going to need another drug to help drive future growth 
Where the company is today
With more than 100 clinical studies that Gilead is working on today  there are many opportunities for the drug manufacturer to find a way to help replace the sales it has lost over the years  The problem is that clinical trials are hit or miss  and there s no guarantee any of them will result in a drug that will be as successful as Harvoni once was 
At a minimum  the company needs to show more growth than it has been achieving thus far  During the first three quarters of the year  Gilead s product sales have risen by only 2  from the same period last year  Sales from HIV drugs remain strong and up 12  year over year  but it s the lagging drug sales from all its other products that are weighing Gilead s top line down  In the company s third quarter  sales of Ranexa and Letairis were down 83  and 50   respectively  The availability of generic drugs has led to a decline in their demand 
Developing new drugs is key  and that poses a big question mark over whether the stock is a good investment today or not 
Why the stock may be a good buy
Gilead could be a calculated risk for investors to take today  At a forward price to earnings  P E  ratio of just nine  and with the company still generating some good growth from its HIV drugs  there s reason to still be optimistic that the company can turn things around  By comparison  rivals GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol Myers Squibb trade at higher forward P E ratios of 15 and 10  respectively  
With many clinical trials in the works  the company has many opportunities to find more growth in the future  And with Gilead paying shareholders a dividend of 4  per year  investors will be well compensated for their patience ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/podfm,2070404
200645,422161,GILD,Better Buy  Intercept Pharmaceuticals vs  Gilead Sciences,news,"Investing in biotech stocks might just be a great idea  The industry as a whole    as measured by the SPDR S P Biotech ETF Index    provided a return of 45 5  over the past three years  narrowly outperforming the S P 500 and its 44 5  return over the same period  Of course  there are scores of biotech companies to consider investing in  but let s turn our attention to two in particular  Intercept Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ICPT  and Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  
There are important differences between these two companies  For instance  Gilead Sciences  portfolio of products is diverse  whereas Intercept Pharma currently has only one product on the market  However  Intercept Pharma was the better performer last year  The company s shares grew by 22 95   easily topping Gilead Sciences  3 88  return  Will Intercept Pharma continue to outpace Gilead Sciences  Let s look at both companies  businesses and find out which is the better buy 

The case for Intercept 
Intercept s only drug on the market is Ocaliva  a medicine for primary biliary cholangitis  PBC   PBC is a chronic liver disease that  if left untreated  can eventually lead to liver failure  Ocaliva is generating growing sales  During the third quarter  Intercept s total revenue was  61 9 million  The bulk of the company s revenue     61 5 million  to be exact    came from sales of Ocaliva  representing 32  year over year sales growth 
However  Ocaliva could have a more significant opportunity ahead  Intercept recently submitted a New Drug Application  NDA  to the U S  Food and Drug Administration for Ocaliva as a potential treatment for fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   
The potential market for this indication is exciting  Not only are there no approved therapies for fibrosis caused by NASH  but the condition is predicted to become more prevalent in the coming years  For instance  NASH is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplant in the U S   taking the top spot from Hepatitis C  In other words  if Ocaliva gains approval for liver disease caused by NASH  Intercept s revenue could soar along with the company s stock price 
The case for Gilead Sciences
Gilead Sciences  best hopes rest on its lineup of products for the prevention and treatment of HIV  This lineup includes such products as HIV prevention drugs Truvada and Descovy  as well as HIV treatments such as Genvoya and Biktarvy  During the third quarter  Gilead Sciences  HIV product sales were  4 2 billion  13 5  higher than the year ago period  Note that HIV sales accounted for about 75  of Gilead Sciences  revenue  
Besides its HIV business  Gilead Sciences could benefit immensely from its partnership with biotech company Galapagos NV  NASDAQ GLPG   Back in July of last year  Gilead Sciences made an upfront payment of  3 95 billion to Galapagos as well as a  1 1 billion equity investment  The equity investment increased Gilead Sciences  stake in Galapagos from 12 3  to 22   
Gilead Sciences also received the right to  develop and commercialize all current and future programs in all countries outside Europe   Thus  per the agreement  Gilead Sciences acquired the rights to Galapagos  pipeline candidates  including GLPG1690  a potential treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that is currently in phase 3 testing  Gilead Sciences  deal with Galapagos could help the company beef up its portfolio and decrease its top line exposure to its HIV business  
Profitability and valuation
Neither company was profitable during the third quarter  Intercept recorded a net loss of  84 8 million  while Gilead Sciences  net loss was  1 2 billion  But while Gilead Sciences  revenue of  5 6 billion was much higher than Intercept s  61 9 million  the latter seems to be more attractively valued when taking into account future earnings growth  Intercept s price to earnings growth ratio  PEG  is currently 1 07  while Gilead Sciences  PEG is 5 29 
Verdict
There are good arguments for both companies  If Ocaliva gets approved for fibrosis due to NASH  Intercept Pharma s shares will likely skyrocket  thus rewarding the company s shareholders  However  Gilead Sciences looks like a better long term bet as its portfolio is far more diversified  and the company s partnership with Galapagos may yield exciting products to help it keep its revenue afloat  I d personally opt for Gilead Sciences if I had to pick one  but I think both of these biotech stocks are worth considering ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pov1h,2071487

200647,422163,GILD,GILD Vs  TECH  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector might want to consider either Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  or Techne  TECH   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Gilead Sciences has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Techne has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that GILD s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
GILD currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 27  while TECH has a forward P E of 44 48  We also note that GILD has a PEG ratio of 3 79  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  TECH currently has a PEG ratio of 4 04 
Another notable valuation metric for GILD is its P B ratio of 3 96  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  TECH has a P B of 7 08 
Based on these metrics and many more  GILD holds a Value grade of A  while TECH has a Value grade of D

Novo Nordisk has a strong presence in the Diabetes care market  with a global value share of 28 4   The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry  The top line is driven by the strong performance of products such as Victoza  liraglutide  
In September 2019  the FDA approved semaglutide in tablet form  which will be marketed under the brand name Rybelsus  It is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus  It is the first approved glucagon like peptide 1  GLP 1  receptor agonist in a tablet form  The drug is also under review with several regulatory agencies  including the European Medicines Agency and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency 
Additionally  the company is making efforts to develop new treatments for diabetes  which is its core area of expertise 
In February 2019  the FDA approved Novo Nordisk s biologics license application  BLA  for Esperoct  turoctocog alfa pegol  N8 GP  for the treatment of hemophilia A in adults and children  The drug is approved for routine prophylactic to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes  on demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes plus perioperative management of bleeding in the given patient population  In July  the European Commission granted marketing authorization to the drug for the treatment of adolescents   12 years of age  and adults with hemophilia A

The company has also been on track with acquisitions in order to boost its portfolio  In November 2019  Novo Nordisk and UBE Industries Ltd  announced that the former obtained an exclusive worldwide license to UBE s preclinical asset UD 014  a selective Semicarbazide Sensitive Amine Oxidase Vascular Adhesion Protein 1  SSAO VAP 1  inhibitor small molecule  which has shown promising efficacy in preclinical studies for its anti inflammatory mechanism of action and antioxidative effect on endothelial cells  and can potentially be used for the treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   
In October 2019  Novo Nordisk and bluebird   NASDAQ BLUE   inked a three year research collaboration to jointly develop next generation vivo genome editing treatments for genetic diseases  including hemophilia  Per the agreement  both companies will focus on identifying a development gene therapy candidate to offer people with hemophilia A a lifetime free of factor replacement therapy

200659,422175,GILD,Half of lymphoma patients alive three years after Gilead cell therapy treatment  study,news,"By Manas Mishra
 Reuters    Nearly half of lymphoma patients treated with Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  Inc s Yescarta were alive at least three years after a one time infusion of the CAR T cell therapy  according to data presented on Saturday 
Out of 101 patients teated with Yescarta for an aggressive blood cancer known as refractory large B cell lymphoma in the study  47 were still alive at least three years later  the data presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in Orlando showed 
 We are delivering towards our goal of potentially life saving therapy for many patients who previously faced limited treatment options   Christi Shaw  chief executive of Gilead s Kite unit  said in a statement  Gilead bought Kite in 2017 for  12 billion to acquire Yescarta 
Sales of Yescarta  which won U S  approval in October 2017 and carries a list price of  373 000  were slow to take off due to a range of issues  including high hospital costs and a complicated manufacturing process 
Global sales for the first nine months of 2019 were  334 million  Analysts forecast annual sales reaching  1 billion by 2022 and climbing from there  according to Refinitiv data 
Yescarta belongs to a new class of cancer treatments called CAR T therapy  seen as potentially revolutionary due to their promise of long term survival with a one time treatment for certain deadly blood cancers  such as relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphomas 
The treatment is made by harvesting T cells from a patient s own immune system  They are then engineered to more efficiently recognize and attack the cancer cells before being infused back into the patient 
Yescarta competes with Kymriah from Novartis AG  while several companies also are developing CAR T treatments  including some that aim to be off the shelf rather than patient specific 
Gilead also reported that steroids given to one group of patients helped reduce the risk of a serious complication associated with CAR T therapy called cytokine release syndrome  CRS   which can cause a range of dangerous symptoms including fever and neurological problems 
 Early steroid intervention has the potential to reduce the rate of severe CRS and neurologic events while appearing to maintain comparably impressive efficacy for Yescarta   Dr  Max Topp  a researcher from University Hospital of Wuerzburg  Germany who worked on the study  said in a statement ",2019-12-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/half-of-lymphoma-patients-alive-three-years-after-gilead-cell-therapy-treatment-study-2036285,2036285

200672,422188,GILD,Medicare to cover expensive cancer cell therapies,news,"By Deena Beasley
 Reuters    The U S  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  on Wednesday said it has finalized a decision to cover expensive cancer cell therapies sold by  Gilead Sciences Inc   O GILD  and  Novartis  AG  S NOVN  
CMS  which runs Medicare   the federal government s health plan for Americans 65 and older   said it will cover the U S  Food and Drug Administration approved therapies when provided in healthcare facilities that have programs in place to track patient outcomes 
The nationwide decision clears up  a lot of confusion  about coverage and will help patients get access to the novel therapies  known as CAR T  CMS Administrator Seema Verma said during a conference call with reporters on Wednesday 
The decision follows the agency s finalization last week of a proposal to raise its maximum CAR T payment to 65  of estimated costs from 50   Some hospitals will also be eligible for supplemental payments in certain cases 
Both Gilead s Yescarta and Novartis  Kymriah were approved in 2017 for certain kinds of lymphoma and leukemia  But government and private health plans have balked at their high price of at least  373 000 for a one time treatment before hospital costs  which can bring the bill for a single patient to over a million dollars 
More than half of lymphoma patients eligible for CAR T therapy are estimated to be covered by Medicare 
The agency said it will also cover the CAR Ts for uses not approved in their labels  as long as they are recommended by CMS approved medical guidelines 
The novel treatments remove a type of immune system cells from each individual patient and re engineer them to better fight certain blood cancers  keeping nearly 40  of patients alive for more than two years  according to some studies ",2019-08-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/medicare-to-cover-expensive-cancer-cell-therapies-1948695,1948695

200697,422213,GILD,Gilead Sciences  GILD  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This HIV and hepatitis C drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Revenues are expected to be  5 62 billion  up 0 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 43  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gilead 
For Gilead  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Gilead will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Gilead would post earnings of  1 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 82  delivering a surprise of  4 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Gilead appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gilead-sciences-gild-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200474632,200474632

200754,422270,GILD,Gilead Sciences  GILD  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This HIV and hepatitis C drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 53 billion  down 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 17  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gilead 
For Gilead  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Gilead will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Gilead would post earnings of  1 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 76  delivering a surprise of  8 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Gilead appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gilead-sciences-gild-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q2-release-200443288,200443288

200847,422363,GILD,Here s why Gilead broke its dealmaking hiatus and splurged  12 billion on a cancer treatment,news,"Since its bombshell hepatitis C treatments hit the market in 2013  the company has been amassing a staggering war chest  The company ended fiscal 2016 with  32 billion in cash on its balance sheet  up from  2 6 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 
But aside from a few small deals  Gilead s  NASDAQ GILD  last major transaction was the one that fueled its current cash bonanza  the 2011 acquisition of hepatitis drugmaker Pharmasset for  11 billion 
After several quiet years of watching hepatitis C treatments Sovaldi and Harvoni generate tens of billions in revenue  Gilead made a splashy return to M A Monday  buying cancer immunotherapy firm  Kite Pharma   NASDAQ KITE  for  11 9 billion in cash  a 29  premium 
Gilead shares traded up just over 1  Monday  but Wall Street wasn t uniformly impressed  In a survey by Mizuho Securities on Monday of 112 investors  59  thought Gilead overpaid  Only 40  said they liked the deal 
Many investors are wondering  Why did Gilead finally decide to strike 
According to several people familiar with the transaction  Gilead became convinced after extensive due diligence that Kite s personalized cancer treatment   a therapy called CAR T that harnesses the body s immune system to attack cancer cells   would not just gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration  but become transformative 
The powerful trial data it s delivered in the past year was crucial 
 Gilead is a very patient  diligent party when it comes to looking at strategic transactions   said one person familiar with the matter   The primary thing was just the clinical data and the success that Kite has had developing the program  
 There just aren t a lot of assets out there like Kite that have the kind of data they ve been able to deliver   they continued 
In data Kite released in February  the company found that out of 101 patients  36  had a complete response to the treatment after six months 
The FDA is expected to decide on whether to approve Kite s CAR T therapy in November 
Some have suggested that Gilead could have waited till after Kite s treatment   which has competition from Novartis  Juno Therapeutics  and Bluebird Bio   had been approved  priced  and launched  hedging against some of the risks 
But after a lengthy due diligence process  and the revelation of the promising trial data  Gilead believed Kite s program had too much upside  and that if they waited  competition for the target would soar   along with Kite s valuation 
 Quite frankly  they thought strategically  Kite  had an edge on other companies   another person familiar with the transaction said 
By acquiring now  the people also noted  Gilead is in position to exert its financial muscle in marketing and shaping the eventual launch of the therapy  which is expected to cost hundreds of thousands per patient ",2017-08-29,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/heres-why-gilead-broke-its-dealmaking-hiatus-and-splurged-12-billion-on-a-cancer-treatment-523424,523424

200852,422368,GILD,CymaBay Down On Dismal Interim Data From Mid Stage NASH Study,opinion,"Shares of CymaBay Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ CBAY   plunged significantly after it announced disappointing interim data from a mid stage study on lead pipeline candidate  seladelpar  
Seladelpar is a potent and selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta  PPAR   agonist currently in development for non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  
The double blind  placebo controlled study randomized 181 subjects with biopsy confirmed NASH and a liver fat content  LFC  greater than 10  to receive either placebo or seladelpar 10 mg  20 mg  or 50 mg once daily  The primary endpoint was the relative change in LFC from baseline to 12 weeks 
Top line results from the ongoing 52 week phase IIb dose ranging  paired liver biopsy study of seladelpar at 12 weeks showed that treatment with seladelpar resulted in minimal reductions in liver fat that were not significant enough compared to placebo 
Nevertheless  reductions in markers of liver injury were robust and clinically meaningful  The study remains blinded and will continue to 52 weeks  with assessments including a liver biopsy  non invasive imaging evaluations  and biomarker assessments of inflammation and fibrosis 
Seladelpar demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile at all doses evaluated in the study 
A chronic liver disease  NASH  is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver or steatosis  The ailment is anticipated to be the leading reason behind liver transplantation by 2020  Currently  NASH is the primary reason for liver transplants in people under 50 years in the United States  With no treatments currently approved to address this disease  the market opportunity is substantially huge  Thus  many companies are investing a major chunk of their R D budget on the same 
Hence  the dismal interim data disappointed investors 
CymaBay s stock has lost 23 1  in the year so far compared with 16 1  decline for the  

 
NASH is a complex disease and there have been quite a few failures of late  Conatus Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ CNAT   phase IIb ENCORE NF study in patients with biopsy confirmed NASH and liver fibrosis also failed to achieve goals 
Earlier  biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   too suffered a setback with the failure of a late stage study on pipeline candidate  selonsertib  in patients with compensated cirrhosis  F4  due to NASH 
Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ICPT   had earlier announced positive top line results from its pivotal phase III REGENERATE study of obeticholic acid  OCA  on patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH  While the results showed promise  investors weren t impressed with additional data 
We expect investors to focus on further updates from the study

Phase III studies on filgotinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  RA  and Crohn s disease are currently ongoing  Based on the positive data from the ongoing trials  Gilead plans to progress with filgotinib in the RA indication for regulatory approval in Europe in the second half of this year  The successful development and commercialization of the candidate will boost growth for the company 
Further  Gilead and Denmark based pharma giant Novo Nordisk  CSE NOVOb  A S   NYSE NVO   intend to collaborate to develop treatments for NASH 
Meanwhile  softness in the HCV franchise has stabilized in the first quarter

200971,422487,GILD,GILD Vs  ALKS  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector have probably already heard of Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  and Alkermes  ALKS   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both Gilead Sciences and Alkermes have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
GILD currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 45  while ALKS has a forward P E of 95 86  We also note that GILD has a PEG ratio of 0 93  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ALKS currently has a PEG ratio of 3 42 
Another notable valuation metric for GILD is its P B ratio of 3 77  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ALKS has a P B of 4 61 
Based on these metrics and many more  GILD holds a Value grade of A  while ALKS has a Value grade of D 
Both GILD and ALKS are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that GILD is the superior value option right now ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gild-vs-alks-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200410835,200410835
200972,422488,GILD,Gilead Sciences  GILD  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This HIV and hepatitis C drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  5 34 billion  up 4 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 64  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gilead 
For Gilead  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Gilead will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Gilead would post earnings of  1 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 44  delivering a surprise of  15 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Gilead appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gilead-sciences-gild-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200410971,200410971

Note  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Likely to Impact Q1
For the first quarter of 2019  Gilead expects product sales to decline 12 14  sequentially  primarily owing to the U S  seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively impact payer mix 
While the company s revenues in the last reported quarter beat estimates  the year over year decline was disappointing as the magnitude of decline in hepatitis C virus  HCV  sales continued to deepen 
Nevertheless  the HIV franchise is expected to maintain momentum  Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide   TAF   based products   Genvoya  Descovy and Odefsey  We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well  Genvoya has been listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines 
Truvada  for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting  continued to maintain momentum with an estimated 202 000 patients using the drug by the end of the fourth quarter  We expect the momentum to continue in the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya and Descovy are projected at  1 2 billion and  408 million 
The FDA approval of Gilead s once daily single tablet regimen   STR    Biktarvy  bictegravir 50mg emtricitabine 200mg tenofovir alafenamide 25mg  BIC FTC TAF  for HIV 1 infection has boosted the portfolio   This is expected to drive sales in the first quarter 
Apart from the regular top and bottom line numbers in the to be reported quarter  we expect investors to focus on pipeline updates  The company also submitted a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  to the FDA for Descovy as pre exposure prophylaxis  PrEP  to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV 1 infection among individuals  who are HIV negative and at risk for HIV 
Gilead intends to foray into the non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and inflammation market with late stage candidates  selonsertib and filgotinib  respectively  However  the company suffered a setback with the failure of a late stage study on NASH candidate  selonsertib 
Earlier in the month  the company announced a strategic collaboration with a privately held  data driven company  Insitro  for discovering and developing therapies targeting NASH  In addition  Gilead and Denmark based pharma giant Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  A S   NYSE NVO   announced that both the companies intend to collaborate to develop treatments for NASH 
Moreover  the company and partner Galapagos NV announced encouraging interim safety information from four studies on experimental candidate  filgotinib  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  RA

2018 Results
The company reported a net loss  1 44 per share in 2018 compared with a net loss of  1 23 in 2017  The increase reflects reduced revenues during 2018 due to an accelerated milestone received during 2017 from Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  that went missing in 2018  Revenues were also negatively impacted by loss incurred in 2018 on early extinguishment of debt and increased non cash interest on the company s liability related to the sale of future royalties

Notably  shares of Conatus have plummeted 55 2  in the past six months compared with the  decline of 4 7  

 
Conatus is conducting three phase IIb ENCORE studies on emricasan for treating fibrosis or cirrhosis induced by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   The programs are named ENCORE NF  for NASH fibrosis   ENCORE PH  for portal hypertension  and ENCORE LF  for liver function  
The randomized  double blind ENCORE NF study was initiated in the first quarter of 2016 in patients with biopsy confirmed NASH and liver fibrosis  The study enrolled and treated 318 patients with biopsy confirmed NASH Clinical Research Network  CRN  fibrosis stages F1 F3 at baseline 
Patients enrolled in the study were randomized 1 1 1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan  50 mg of emricasan  or placebo twice daily for 72 weeks  The trial was conducted at 87 U S  and EU sites 
The trial s primary endpoint was a  1 CRN fibrosis stage improvement without any worsening of steatohepatitis compared with placebo at week 72  However  the candidate did not meet its primary endpoint as it did not have the desired effect on these earlier stage NASH fibrosis patients 
Nevertheless  the candidate is also being evaluated in more advanced stage NASH cirrhosis patients  ENCORE LF is evaluating emricasan in approximately 210 patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis  The trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2017 and is advancing toward an event driven analysis of clinical outcome results expected in mid 2019 
Conatus currently has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant  Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   for the development of emricasan 
The failure of the study is disappointing  given the potential in the NASH market  In December 2018  the ENCORE PH study also failed to meet the primary endpoint 
Earlier  biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   also announced the failure of a late stage study on selonsertib  involving patients afflicted with compensated cirrhosis  F4  due to NASH  
Nevertheless  Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   seems to be winning this race  The company announced positive top line results from its pivotal phase III REGENERATE study of OCA in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH  Intercept stated that the primary endpoint of the study   fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH at 18 months   was achieved with the 25 mg daily dose of OCA  The company plans to file for approval of OCA as a NASH treatment in the United States and Europe in the second half of 2019

201028,422544,GILD,Gilead Files SNDA For Label Expansion Of HIV Therapy Descovy,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  to the FDA for Descovy  emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets  
The company is seeking FDA approval for Descovy as pre exposure prophylaxis  PrEP  to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV 1 infection among individuals  who are HIV negative and at risk for HIV   While Descovy is already approved in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in patients weighing greater or equal to 25 kg  it is not indicated for PrEP yet 
A priority review voucher was submitted with the filing  Hence  the anticipated review time for the sNDA is expected to be six months 
The filing is based on the results of the phase III study  DISCOVER  which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Descovy compared to Truvada in men and transgender women  who sexually engage with men at high risk of contracting HIV infection   The results showed that Descovy achieved non inferiority to Truvada in study participants  who were at substantial and sustained risk of HIV acquisition 
Given the persistent decline in HCV sales  the company is looking to HIV and newer avenues to boost its top line 
The stock has gained 8 3  in the year so far  lagging the s growth of 12 2  

 
However  Gilead will have to generate substantial revenues from its HIV franchise to offset the HCV sales decline  This will be a challenging task for the company with stiff competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   in the HIV market 
The company is intending to foray into the non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and inflammation markets with late stage candidates  selonsertib and filgotinib  respectively  Gilead and partner Galapagos NV   NASDAQ GLPG   announced encouraging interim safety information from four studies on filgotinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  RA

figure of  95 5 million  The significant decrease in revenues was attributable to  60 0 million of non recurring revenues recorded in the third quarter of 2017 related to a new sublicense agreement  a

However  the company announced on its earnings call that the FDA has extended the review period by three months  A decision is now expected by Aug 29  2019  The FDA extended the review period due to submission of additional preclinical abuse liability data  which it had requested earlier General and administrative  G A  expenses were up 93 5  to  23 8 million in the reported quarter primarily due to higher stock based compensation expenses Full Year ResultsNektar reported total revenues of  1 2 billion in 2018 compared with  307 8 million in the year ago period  The significant increase was

201043,422559,GILD,Intercept  ICPT  Up On Q4 Revenue Beat  NASH Study In Focus ,opinion,"Shares of Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   gained 7 5  after the company posted mixed results for the fourth quarter of 2018 wherein even though earnings missed estimates  revenues beat the same 
Investors are upbeat about the company s increase in Ocaliva sales and landmark results from its REGENERATE study  which were reported earlier  
Notably  Intercept s stock has surged 8 7  in the past six months Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   The company incurred a loss of  2 97 per share in the fourth quarter  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  2 42 but narrower than the year ago loss of  4 43 
Quarterly revenues were  53 3 million  up from  37 7 million in the year ago quarter  Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  51 7 million 
Quarter in Detail
Ocaliva recorded  52 9 million of sales  up from  46 6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2018 and  37 3 million in the year earlier period  Net sales in the United States came in at  41 1 million while the ex U S  Ocaliva net sales summed  11 8 million 
Ocaliva in combination with ursodeoxycholic  UDCA  was approved in the United States during 2016 for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis   PBC   in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults  who are unable to endure UDCA  The drug was also granted a conditional approval by the European Commission  In February 2018  Ocaliva s label was updated in the United States to include a boxed warning and a dosing table that reinforced the existing dosing schedule in PBC patients with Child Pugh Class B or C or decompensated cirrhosis 
Research and development expenses increased 10 1  year over year to  63 3 million  primarily driven by more clinical development programs for Ocaliva  However  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased 15 8  to  71 million 
2019 Outlook
Ocaliva s net sales are expected between  225 million and  240 million in 2019  Intercept continues to expect operating expenses to be  450  470 million in 2019 
Pipeline Update
Obeticholic acid  OCA  is also being evaluated for other indications including non alcoholic steatohepatitis   NASH   and primary sclerosing cholangitis   PSC   
Earlier in 2019  Intercept announced positive top line results from its pivotal phase III REGENERATE study of OCA on patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH   The company stated that the primary endpoint of the study   fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH at 18 months   was achieved with the 25 mg daily dose of OCA 
Also  a numerically greater proportion of patients in both OCA treatment arms  taking doses of 10 mg and 25 mg  met the primary endpoint of NASH resolution with no deterioration of liver fibrosis as compared to placebo  However  this did not reach statistical significance  Nevertheless  the study was required to attain one of the two primary goals per the FDA which it did 
Intercept plans to file for an approval of OCA as a NASH treatment both in the United States and in Europe during the second half of 2019  The company will also release data from the REGENERATE analysis at the European Association for the Study of the Liver  EASL  conference in April 
The REVERSE study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ocaliva on NASH patients suffering compensated cirrhosis  The probe is currently enrolling patients  which is expected to be complete by the end of 2019 
Our Take
Intercept s fourth quarter results were mixed as earnings lagged expectations but sales beat the mark  Management s efforts to increase awareness about the label update in 2018 and expansion in sales force across the United States thereafter  is reaping results  Solid growth in new patient enrollment is likely to drive stronger sales in 2019 
Moreover  the favorable outcomes from the REGENERATE assessment are a big boost to Intercept  This news significantly buoyed investor sentiments given the market potential of NASH and the fact that biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced the failure of a late stage study on selonsertib  involving patients afflicted with compensated cirrhosis  F4  due to NASH  This in turn  puts Intercept ahead in the race to get a drug approved for NASH 
The market for NASH is expected to be one of the target areas in 2019 by most large pharma biotech companies  This market is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative yet saturated markets like cancer  With no treatments currently approved to address this disease  the market opportunity is substantially huge  In fact  many companies are investing a major chunk of the respective R D spends in the same 
Madrigal Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ MDGL   and Viking Therapeutics  Inc  too have promising NASH candidates in the respective pipelines  Pharma giant Merck   NYSE MRK   recently exercised its option to license NGM313  an investigational monoclonal antibody agonist of the   Klotho FGFR1c receptor complex that is currently being evaluated for the treatment of NASH and type 2 diabetes 
Hence  we expect investors to focus on further updates from the NASH program  A tentative approval will be significant for Intercept

201045,422561,GILD,Gilead Reports Positive Data On HIV Drugs Biktarvy   Descovy,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   presented a series of data at the 2019 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections  CROI  in Seattle 
The company announced results from two studies evaluating the resistance profile of a once daily single tablet HIV regimen  Biktarvy  bictegravir 50 mg emtricitabine 200 mg tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets  BIC FTC TAF  in virologically suppressed adults switching from dolutegravir abacavir lamivudine  DTG ABC 3TC  or a boosted protease inhibitor  PI  based regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 
The results showed high rates of virologic suppression with Biktarvy in treatment experienced adults  regardless of pre existing resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  NRTIs  
We note that Biktarvy is already approved in the United States as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 infection in adults without any antiretroviral treatment history  Biktarvy is also approved to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those adults who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least three months 
Gilead announced 48 week results from a phase II III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Biktarvy in virologically suppressed adolescents and children at least 6 years of age infected with HIV   Biktarvy maintained high rates of virologic suppression with a low incidence of study drug related adverse events and no treatment emergent resistance at week 48 
Gilead also announced results from the phase III randomized  controlled  double blind study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the investigational use of once daily Descovy for HIV pre exposure prophylaxis  PrEP  compared with Truvada  in men who have sex with men and transgender women at risk of sexually acquired HIV infection  Descovy met the pre established criteria for non inferiority to Truvada using a stringent rate ratio statistical comparison 
Moreover  results showed that participants receiving Descovy have significant advantages with respect to bone and renal laboratory parameters  which were pre specified secondary endpoints  compared with those receiving Truvada  Descovy is already approved in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in patients weighing 35 kg or more but is not indicated for PrEP  Truvada is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for HIV PrEP to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV in at risk adults and adolescents weighing 35 kg or more 
Gilead plans to file regulatory applications for Descovy for the PrEP indication as a potential important new option to prevent individuals from getting infected and contribute to the achievement of national and global HIV prevention goals 
Gilead s stock has lost 12 1  in the past six months compared with the s decline of 14  

 
Gilead s HIV franchise maintains momentum  driven by the rapid adoption of Descovy based regimens and Biktarvy  However  Gilead will have to generate substantial revenues from its HIV franchise to offset the HCV sales decline  This will be a challenging task for the company with stiff competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   in the HIV market 
Given the persistent decline in HCV sales  the company is looking to HIV and newer avenues to help the top line  The initial uptake of Yescarta  from the Kite Pharma acquisition  is also encouraging but it will take some time for sales to contribute significantly to the top line  given the high cost of the treatment  Moreover  Novartis    NYSE NVS   Kymriah is also there in the market  posing competition 
Gilead also collaborated with Agneus   NASDAQ AGEN   for the development and commercialization of up to five novel immuno oncology therapies

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2015  Gilead saw its revenue surge by 38  to  8 3 billion  considerably above analysts  forecasts of net sales of  7 8 billion for the period  It came as the company s revenues for its two Hepatitis C drugs   Harvoni and Solvadi   reached  4 8 billion on the quarter  above analysts  expectations of  4 47 billion  Sales for Solvadi exceeded  1 45 billion for the three month period  also above forecasts of  1 16 billion  
Overall  Gilead reported earnings of  4 6 billion or 3 06 per share for the third quarter  up from quarterly earnings of  2 73 billion or 1 67 per share over the third quarter of 2014  Analysts expected the company to report earnings of 2 87 per share for the quarter

While Gilead raised its full year guidance by  1 billion on Tuesday  analysts remained concerned that increased competition from rivals such as AbbVie in the Hepatitis C prescription drug market could dent sales  Still  Gilead expects full year revenues to fall within a range of  30  31 billion for 2015

The U S  dollar suffered its worst one day loss against the euro in more than six years after the ECB left several key interest rates unchanged and opted not to increase the pace of its  60 billion a month quantitative easing program  as many expected  Yellen  the chair of the Federal Reserve  told a Congressional hearing that the U S  economy needs to add fewer than 100 000 jobs a month to absorb the losses of those who fell out of the labor market in recent years  Her comments came one day before a critical U S  jobs report on Friday could pave the way for the Fed to raise short term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade

A Fed rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar  but bearish for equities  as foreign investors exit their positions and pile into U S  Treasuries in order to capitalize on higher yields  The dollar also suffered on Thursday  as investors abandoned short positions in the euro  amid expectations for a significant expansion in the ECB s bond buying program and deeper cuts in its deposit facility rate

The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Avago Technologies  which rose 11 91 or 9 01  to 144 12  after topping third quarter expectations on Thursday  For the company s third quarter  which ended in early November  the Silicon Valley based chipmaker saw its revenue surge 16   amid strong growth in its wireless and device storage divisions

201063,422579,GILD,Gilead s  GILD  Late Stage Study On Liver Disease Drug Fails ,opinion,"Shares of Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   declined in after market trading on Feb 11  after the company announced the failure of a late stage study on pipeline candidate  selonsertib  in patients with compensated cirrhosis  F4  due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  
Gilead s stock has declined 17 8  in the past six months compared with the  decline of 16 5  

 
STELLAR 4  a phase III  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study  n 877  evaluated the safety and efficacy of selonsertib  which is an investigational  once daily  oral inhibitor of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1  ASK1   in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH 
However  the study did not meet the pre specified week 48 primary endpoint of a   1 stage histologic improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH 
Gilead is conducting an in depth analysis of the findings and data will be submitted to an upcoming scientific conference  The company is also working with the Data Monitoring Committee and investigators to conclude the STELLAR 4 study in a manner consistent with the best interests of each patient 
Meanwhile  results from the phase III STELLAR 3 trial of selonsertib in patients with bridging fibrosis  F3  due to NASH and the phase II ATLAS combination trial of selonsertib  cilofexor  GS 9674  and firsocostat  GS 0976  in patients with advanced fibrosis are expected later this year 
The failure of the STELLAR 4 study comes as a disappointment  given the significant market potential of NASH  We note that Gilead had shifted focus to its HIV franchise and newer avenues like CAR T therapy and NASH  given the persistent decline in its once market leading HCV franchise 
The market for NASH promises potential and is expected to be one of the target areas in 2019 by most large pharma biotech companies  This market is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative yet saturated markets like cancer  A chronic liver disease  NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver  known as steatosis  Per records  it has affected up to 15 million people in the United Stated and could cause inflammation  hepatocellular injury  progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis 
With no treatments currently approved to address this disease  the market opportunity is substantially huge  In fact  many companies are investing a major chunk of their R D spend in the same

edited liver cells are able to generate active  Iduronate 2 sulfatase  IDS enzyme in patients with MPS II  Additional data from the study is awaited later this year  which will help explain if the small increases in IDS enzyme activity observed can translate into improved outcomes in MPS II patients Another similar candidate  SB 318  is currently being examined in a phase I II EMPOWERS program for treating MPS I  Earlier this month  the company also presented interim findings from the study on SB 318  Data from the same provided complementary evidence  supportive of a positive safety

201076,422592,GILD,Clinton proposes  250 monthly cap on prescription drug costs,news,"By Amanda Becker DES MOINES  Iowa  Reuters    U S  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proposed on Tuesday a  250 monthly cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs and other measures to stop what she called  price gouging  by pharmaceutical companies  At a campaign stop in Iowa  Clinton rolled out a plan to encourage the development and use of generic drugs and to end pharmaceutical companies  ability to write off consumer directed advertising as a business expense  Under Clinton s plan  the monthly cap would limit what insurance companies could ask patients to pay for drugs that treat chronic or serious medical conditions   We need to protect hard working Americans here at home from excessive costs  Too often these drugs cost a fortune   she said in Des Moines  adding drug companies keep the profits for themselves while  shifting the cost to families   Clinton s comments came after the New York Times reported on how a startup biotechnology company  Turing Pharmaceuticals  raised the price of the 62 year old Daraprim treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection to  750 a tablet from  13 50 after acquiring it   That is bad actors making a fortune off people s misfortune   she said  In the face of sharp criticism of its action by patients  medical groups and Clinton  Turing s chief executive officer  Martin Shkreli  told ABC s  World News Tonight  on Tuesday that the price of Daraprim would be lowered  to a point that is more affordable    Good   tweeted Clinton in response to news of the planned price rollback  The Nasdaq Biotechnology index closed down 1 7 percent on Tuesday after falling as much as 3 5 percent during the session  It had already fallen 4 4 percent on Monday after Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices of some drugs  The index  which had finished the last six years higher  is up 10 4 percent so far this year  Citi biotechnology analyst Liav Abraham said that with 2016 presidential candidates taking on steep drug pricing   companies with less differentiated  more concentrated product portfolios are likely to come under increased political scrutiny   But the rhetoric may have  more bark than bite   he said  since the reforms would require approval by a Republican dominated Congress that is unlikely to implement them  While Clinton has maintained her front runner status in the Democratic race  she has been under pressure to take more populist stances to widen her lead over U S  Senator Bernie Sanders  her second place rival who has also offered a plan to rein in prescription drug costs  CONSUMER MARKETING CONTROVERSY Critics of marketing drugs to consumers say it encourages the use of costly brand names over generics and can be confusing or misleading  A series of court decisions has determined the practice cannot be banned outright because it is a form of commercial speech protected by the U S  Constitution  Clinton said the government could get billions of dollars in additional tax revenue by no longer allowing pharmaceutical companies to deduct what they spend marketing drugs to consumers  The largest pharmaceutical companies are collectively earning  80 billion to  90 billion per year at higher margins than other industries while average Americans struggle to pay for medicine  Clinton s campaign said  Clinton also proposed a ban on  pay for delay agreements   in which the owner of a brand name drug pays a generic competitor to keep its product off the market for a period of time  usually as part of a litigation settlement  Clinton said she wanted Medicare  the U S  government s health insurance program for the elderly  to be able to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices and require more generous rebates  Consumers would also be allowed to purchase drugs from other countries  where medicine is often less expensive  so long as sufficient safety standards are in place  Clinton said  She said her proposals would augment President Barack Obama s healthcare law known as Obamacare  High drug costs had played a role in making families feel like healthcare costs were not coming under control  she said  Clinton was expected to outline a separate set of proposals on Wednesday to address other out of pocket healthcare costs  Traditional  Big Pharma  companies have long faced criticism for steadily raising prices of their prescription medicines in the United States  often by jumps of 10 percent or more   Drugmakers are unapologetic about their five  or six digit prices on new treatments for cancer  hepatitis C and high cholesterol  Sovaldi  a treatment from  Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ GILD   can cure hepatitis C but at a cost of  1 000 per pill   Even more controversial have been eye popping increases in costs for older drugs in limited supply  often after other drugmakers acquire them  They say the funds help cover research and development costs for new products

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  15 29   A quarter ago  it was expected that this HIV and hepatitis C drugmaker would post earnings of  1 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 84  delivering a surprise of 10 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Gilead  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  posted revenues of  5 80 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 81   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 95 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Gilead shares have added about 12  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8  
What s Next for Gilead 
While Gilead has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Gilead was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Consensus Estimate of  5 53 billion but declined 2 6  year over year HIV Franchise Sustains MomentumProduct sales came in at  5 7 billion  down 2 7  year over year due to continued decline in legacy hepatitis C virus  HCV  franchise HCV product sales plunged 50 8  to  738 million  due to lower average net selling price and decreased sales volumes of Harvoni and Epclusa across all major markets as a result of increased competition and lower patient starts  Sales of Harvoni plunged 63 9  year over year to  232 million in the quarter   Epclusa garnered sales of  453 million  down 19 8  from the year ago quarter HIV product sales increased 20 6  year over year to  4 1 billion  primarily owing to the continued uptake of Genvoya and Odefsey  and the rapid adoption of Biktarvy  The quarter are also benefited from seasonal inventory purchases and a favorable payer mix  Genvoya generated sales of  1 2 billion  up from  1 0 billion in the year ago quarter  Descovy recorded sales of  411 million  up from  365 million a year ago  while Odefsey registered sales of  448 million  up from  325 million in the year ago quarter In the United States  77  of Gilead s total HIV treatment prescription volumes comprised Descovy based regimens  We note that Gilead received a major boost when the FDA approved the company s once daily single tablet regimen   STR    Biktarvy  bictegravir 50mg emtricitabine 200mg tenofovir alafenamide 25mg  BIC FTC TAF  for HIV 1 infection  The approval of Biktarvy in Europe boosted sales further  Bikatrvy s sales came in at  578 million   Approximately 80  of Biktarvy s U S  prescriptions came from switches  25  of which came from dolutegravir and another 25  from Genvoya   Truvada  for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting  continued to maintain momentum with an estimated 202  000 patients using the drug by the end of the fourth quarter  However  HIV sales were slightly down year over year in Europe  due to generic competition in several markets  During 2018  Gilead experienced slower erosion of the HIV franchise due to later generic entry in a few countries HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera Eviplera sales declined 38 3  and 43 7   respectively   Atripla sales slumped 35 2  to  258 million  while Truvada sales increased 3 3  to  823 million CAR T therapy Yescarta  axicabtagene ciloleucel   which was launched in the United States in October 2017  generated  81 million in sales  up from  75 million in the previous quarter   In August  Yescarta was approved in Europe Other product sales  which

adjusted SG A expenses are projected to be  3 6  3 8 billion and  3 9  4 1 billion  respectively  Adjusted product gross margin is expected to be 85 87  For the first quarter of 2019  Gilead expects product sales to decline sequentially by 12 14   primarily owing to the U S  seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively impact payer mix Dividend and Share RepurchaseDuring 2018  Gilead generated  8 4 billion in operating cash flow  repaid  6 3 billion of debt  paid cash dividends of  3 0 billion and spent  2 9 billion on repurchases of 40 million shares Our TakeThe earnings miss was disappointing even though the company beat on revenues in the fourth quarter  The HCV franchise sales are expected to decline further While the HIV franchise maintains momentum  driven by the rapid adoption of Descovy based regimens and Biktarvy  Gilead will have to generate substantial revenues from its HIV franchise to offset the HCV sales decline  This will be a challenging task for the company with stiff competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   in the HIV market Given the persistent decline in HCV sales  the company is looking to HIV and newer avenues to help the top line  The initial uptake of Yescarta  from the Kite Pharma acquisition  is also encouraging but it will take some time for sales to contribute significantly to the top line  given the high cost of the treatment  Moreover  Novartis    NYSE NVS   Kymriah is also there in the market  posing competition Gilead has promising late stage candidates like selonsertib and filgotinib in the NASH and inflammation markets  respectively  The company also has a collaboration agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc  to use Sangamo s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology  Gilead also collaborated with Agneus   NASDAQ AGEN   for the development and commercialization of up to five novel immuno oncology therapies Meanwhile  on the earnings call  management hinted that the strong balance sheet should enable the company to go for mergers  acquisitions and partnerships to drive further growth

201100,422616,GILD,Fund managers boost bets on health care even amid high prices,news,By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Last July  when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen spurred a sell off in healthcare stocks by saying that valuations in shares of biotech companies looked  stretched   portfolio manager Graham Tanaka saw an opportunity   After a year long buying spree  he now has more than a quarter of his  17 million Tanaka Growth fund portfolio in healthcare companies such as  Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ GILD   up from just 5 percent at the start of last year       That bet is paying off  his fund is beating the S P 500 by about 13 percentage points since the start of the year  putting Tanaka in the top 1 percent of equity fund managers tracked by Morningstar  Even with his big bet on healthcare  he s planning on adding more       With aging demographics in the US and the developed world  healthcare needs are going to grow dramatically faster than GDP   Tanaka said       In the eleven months since Yellen s warning  other fund managers have benefitted by shaking off concerns about high valuations and increasing their holdings of healthcare companies  The average U S  large cap equity fund run by a stockpicker now holds 15 8 percent of its portfolio in healthcare stocks  a position higher than any of the last 3 years  according to Lipper data       With a 10 percent rally in the sector so far this year  that outsized bet on healthcare is helping fund managers post their best performance relative to the S P 500 since 2007  the year before the financial crisis  Should the rally in healthcare continue  funds may finally be able to turn around a six year skid in which stockpickers have struggled to outperform benchmarks       Yet some market strategists and analysts said that the move to healthcare after its significant outperformance reminds them of the tech bubble of the late 1990s  when stock funds piled into the hot sector just before the dot com crash        Being negative on pharmaceuticals and biotech has not been the right move thus far in 2015  but almost all the objective data suggests that underperformance is likely in the months ahead   said Tobias Levkovich  chief U S  equity strategist at  Citigroup   NYSE C   in a note to clients Tuesday  citing a declining number of upward earnings revisions   Few investors are willing to back off what has been a very rewarding strategy  which also means that when they back away it could get somewhat messy       Still  because health spending is becoming a larger part of the economy  a broad selloff in healthcare companies akin to the popping of the tech bubble is unlikely  said Randy Gwirtzman  co portfolio manager of the  95 million Baron Discovery fund  who more than doubled his holdings of healthcare companies over the last year   Healthcare is expected to rise to 19 9 percent of U S  GDP by 2022 from 17 1 percent in 2013  according to the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  GDP itself is expected to grow 2 4 percent this year  according to a Reuters poll of economists       Gwitzman is looking for companies that can help cut costs  rather than biotechs that offer the promise of new drugs  he said       His top holding  Foundation Medicine Inc  offers a form of cancer testing that allows doctors to offer targeted therapy more effectively  Shares of the company are up nearly 60 percent for the year after Swiss pharma giant Roche took a majority interest in the company in January        There s a lot to like in healthcare other than biotech   he said       If there is a pullback in the healthcare sector  it could be sharp  analysts such as Levkovich said  The Nasdaq Biotechnology index fell nearly 6 percent in three days after Yellen noted high valuations in July  After a subsequent rally  the biotech sector is now trading 43 percent higher than it was before she noted the high valuations          BUYING BEYOND BIOTECH     While few big name funds are significantly reducing their healthcare holdings  some top performing funds are becoming more cautious because of the extent of the rally in biotech and pharma companies  The Nasdaq Biotechnology index is up 52 percent over the last year  while the S P Pharmaceuticals index is up 33 percent over the same time  Those high prices are making it harder for fund managers to find attractive places to put their money  T  Rowe Price closed its  14 1 billion Health Sciences Fund to new investors Monday after receiving  1 1 billion in new investor dollars over the first four months of the year        We ve seen extraordinary returns from stocks like Gilead  but we haven t been taking on any new positions until we find extraordinary discounts   said Rafael Resendes  whose Toreador Core fund has bested 98 percent of other large cap funds over the last three years  Shares of Gilead are up 19 percent for the year to date  and nearly 40 percent over the last 12 months       Resendes  who still holds Gilead  expects to pare down his holdings of healthcare stocks this year because they no longer offer attractive prices      Other managers are

201103,422619,GILD,Analysts Estimate Gilead Sciences  GILD  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This HIV and hepatitis C drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 52 billion  down 7 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 14  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gilead 
For Gilead  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 72  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Gilead will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Gilead would post earnings of  1 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 84  delivering a surprise of  10 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Gilead doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-gilead-sciences-gild-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200380097,200380097
201115,422631,GILD,Intercept  ICPT  Benefits From Ocaliva s Recovery In 2018,opinion,"Shares of Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   have gained 59 2  in the year so far  against the  s decline of 25 6  

 
Intercept s focus is on treating orphan and more prevalent liver diseases with limited treatment options  The company received a significant boost with the FDA approval for lead drug Ocaliva  obeticholic acid OCA  in combination with UDCA  for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults who are intolerant to UDCA in May 2016 
The FDA approved Ocaliva under its accelerated approval program based on a reduction in alkaline phosphatase  ALP   since an improvement in survival or disease related symptoms has not been established yet  Additionally  in December 2016  the European Commission granted conditional approval to Ocaliva in combination with UDCA  In May 2017  the drug was approved in Canada 
The initial uptake was encouraging  However  sales took a hit due to safety and dosing issues  Earleir  the FDA reported 19 deaths due to incorrect dosing of Ocaliva  and stated that the drug may also affect the liver  In February 2018  Ocaliva s label was updated in the United States  to include a boxed warning and a dosing table that reinforced the existing dosing schedule in PBC patients with Child Pugh Class B or C  or decompensated cirrhosis 
Nevertheless  management s efforts to increase awareness about the updated label and promote Ocaliva  thereafter  is reaping results  Ocaliva recorded  46 6 million of sales in the third quarter  up from  43 2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018  The company has expanded its sales force to reach out to more physicians  and sales are expected to ramp up to come between  170 million and  185 million in 2018 
Meanwhile  Ocaliva is also being evaluated for other indications  including non alcoholic steatohepatitis   NASH   and primary sclerosing cholangitis   PSC    The phase III NASH program includes the REGENERATE trial among patients with advanced liver fibrosis and the REVERSE trial among patients with compensated cirrhosis 
The FDA earlier approved a redesign of the phase III REGENERATE trial on Ocaliva for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis  The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint  either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution compared with the earlier target of achieving both 
Top line results from the REGENERATE trial are expected in the first half of 2019  The REVERSE trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ocaliva in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis 
The trial is currently enrolling 
Per estimates  NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis C as the leading reason for liver transplants in the United States and Europe  NASH market has huge potential  and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva s prospects  further  This space has been in focus in 2018  with shares of a few companies soaring on positive data from their NASH candidates 
Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   has a promising late stage NASH candidate  Israel based Galmed Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GLMD   earlier reported positive data on its NASH candidate  Aramchol  Madrigal Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ MDGL   also has a promising candidate for NASH

201119,422635,GILD,Is Eventide Gilead Fund N  ETGLX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"If you have been looking for Mid Cap Growth funds  it would not be wise to start your search with Eventide Gilead  NASDAQ GILD  Fund N  ETGLX   ETGLX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5  Strong Sell   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance 
Objective
Zacks categorizes ETGLX as Mid Cap Growth  a segment packed with options  Mid Cap Growth mutual funds aim to target companies with a market capitalization between  2 billion and  10 billion that are also expected to exhibit more extensive growth opportunities for investors than their peers  A firm is typically considered to be a growth stock if it consistently posts impressive sales and or earnings growth 
History of Fund Manager
ETGLX is a part of the Eventide family of funds  a company based out of Willow Grove  PA  Eventide Gilead Fund N made its debut in July of 2008  and since then  ETGLX has accumulated about  412 39 million in assets  per the most up to date date available  The fund is currently managed by Finny Kuruvilla who has been in charge of the fund since July of 2008 
Performance
Obviously  what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers  This fund carries a 5 year annualized total return of 10 8   and is in the top third among its category peers  If you re interested in shorter time frames  do not dismiss looking at the fund s 3 year annualized total return of 12 03   which places it in the top third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  Over the past three years  ETGLX s standard deviation comes in at 16 18   compared to the category average of 9 45   The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 15 83  compared to the category average of 9 54   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
It s always important to be aware of the downsides to any future investment  so one should not discount the risks that come with this segment 
Nevertheless  investors should also note that the fund has a 5 year beta of 1 22  which means it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large  Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration  since it represents a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark  which in this case  is the S P 500  The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of  1 76  which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Exploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States 
Currently  this mutual fund is holding 91 16  stock in stocks  and these companies have an average market capitalization of  16 84 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Other Technology Health Retail Trade Industrial Cyclical Turnover is 24   which means this fund makes fewer trades than its comparable peers Expenses
For investors  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is key  since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  Competition is heating up in this space  and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  all things being equal  In terms of fees  ETGLX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 1 39  compared to the category average of 1 21   From a cost perspective  ETGLX is actually more expensive than its peers 
Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is  1 000 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at  50 
Bottom Line
Overall  Eventide Gilead Fund N   ETGLX   has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank  and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance  worse downside risk  and higher fees  this fund looks like a poor potential choice for investors right now

201130,422646,GILD,Bristol Myers  Label Expansion Of Sprycel Gets CHMP Nod,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  of the European Medicines Agency has given a positive opinion on the label expansion of oncology drug Sprycel 
The CHMP recommended approval of the drug in combination with chemotherapy  to include the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive  Ph   acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL   The positive opinion includes the tablet form of Sprycel and the powder for oral suspension formulation  which was first approved by the European Commission  EC  in July 2018  making Sprycel the only tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a formulation developed for administration in pediatric patients and patients who cannot swallow tablets 
The EC will now review the recommendation but is not bound by it 
The CHMP recommendation will now be reviewed by the EC  which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union  EU  
The company s supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  for the same indication is under review in the United States  The FDA action date is Dec 29  2018 
We note that Sprycel is already approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with Ph  chronic myeloid leukemia  CML  in chronic phase  CP   The drug also received the FDA approval for adults with Ph  ALL who are resistant to or intolerant of prior therapy  The FDA also approved Sprycel s label expansion to include pediatric patients with Ph  CML CP in November 2017 and the European Commission approved the same in July 2018 
Concurrently  Bristol Myers Squibb  Eisai Co   Ltd  and its U S  based precision medicine research   development subsidiary H3 Biomedicine  Inc  announced a multi year research collaboration  The companies will focus on novel therapeutics generating from H3 s RNA splicing platform and evaluate if these can provide a more powerful response against cancer 
The collaboration will explore modulating RNA splicing to develop potential first in class therapies that would direct the immune system to target cancer cells and help more patients experience the benefits of immunotherapy 
Per the terms  H3 and Bristol Myers will jointly conduct the research  focusing on developing immune therapies using H3 s RNA splicing platform  While the former will be responsible for development and commercialization of selected compounds  the latter is entitled to receive an upfront payment along with development  regulatory and sales milestones  and certain royalties according to sales revenue after launch  On the other hand  Eisai retains an option to co develop and co commercialize certain compounds that emerge from the collaborative research effort 
Moreover  Bristol Myers announced a multi year joint research study with Boston Medical Center to identify and analyze potential sensitivity and resistance markers in patients treated with standard of care checkpoint inhibitors  The study will primarily focus on uncovering mechanisms associated with lack of response to Immuno Oncology  I O  therapies 
Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Bristol Myers  Bristol Myers  stock has decreased 13 1  in the year so far  against the  growth of 6 3  

 
While its blockbuster drug  Opdivo continues to perform well and the label expansion of the drug will further boost the top line  pricing concerns and stiff competition in the immuno oncology space are major concerns  In particular  Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda and Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq pose stiff competition 
Hence  the label expansion of other drugs of the company should maintain the top line momentum 
Another drug of Bristol Myers  Eliquis is also expected to drive further growth  driven by increases in market share in the novel oral anticoagulant  NOAC  market

Our Take
Gilead is making efforts to develop its pipeline in the fibrotic disease sphere  which includes non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and diabetic kidney disease 
Gilead s stock has lost 8 8  in the past six months compared with the s decline of 20 1  

 
Gilead was once a market outperformer  with its strong HCV franchise boasting a number of blockbuster drugs  However  the HCV franchise has been under pressure since the last three four years due to competitive pressure from the likes of AbbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV   
Consequently  Gilead had shifted focus on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like CAR T therapy 
Gilead has been trying to revive its portfolio of late  Gilead has promising late stage candidates   selonsertib and filgotinib   in the NASH and inflammation markets  The company also has a collaboration agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SGMO   to use Sangamo s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology

201132,422648,GILD,Bristol Myers To Sell French Consumer Health Unit For  1 6B,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced that it has received an offer from an over the counter  OTC  drug company in Japan  Taisho Pharmaceutical Holdings Co   Ltd  to purchase the former s consumer health business in France  UPSA for  1 6 billion 
Financial Terms of the Transaction
The potential sale is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019  subject to regulatory approvals and meeting of certain other customary closing conditions  Per the terms  the offer is subject to Bristol Myers  exercise of the put option 
Once the put option is exercised  Bristol Myers and Taisho would execute a definitive stock and assets purchase agreement  Thereafter  Taisho would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of UPSA SAS as well as Bristol Myers  assets and liabilities related to the UPSA product portfolio  Assuming completion  Bristol Myers estimates the potential transaction to be dilutive to the bottom line by 4 cents in 2019  
Strategic Aspect of the Transaction
UPSA  a French pharmaceutical company and a brand owned by Bristol Myers  develops drugs and supplements for day to day ailments  Its portfolio covers a wide range of therapeutic areas like pain  cough   cold  vitamins and supplements  gastrointestinal and sleep 
However  the UPSA business no longer fits in Bristol Myers  core focus area of drugs  and hence the company has decided to divest the same  The company has been looking for potential sale options for the business since June 2018 
Taisho had earlier purchased PT Squibb Indonesia from Bristol Myers  and subsequently entered the OTC market in certain Asian countries 
Our Take
Bristol Myers is in the process of realigning its portfolio to focus better on drugs for patients facing serious diseases 
While its blockbuster drug  Opdivo continues to perform well and the label expansion of the same will further boost the top line  pricing concerns and stiff competition in the immuno oncology space are major concerns  In particular  Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda and Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq pose stiff competition 
Bristol Myers s stock has decreased 15 6  in the year so far  against the  growth of 4 9  

 
The company recently announced a multi year research collaboration with Eisai Co   Ltd  and its U S  based precision medicine research   development subsidiary H3 Biomedicine  Inc  to focus on novel therapeutics generating from H3 s RNA splicing platform and evaluate if these can provide a more powerful response against cancer 
Moreover  Bristol Myers announced a multi year joint research study with Boston Medical Center to identify and analyze potential sensitivity and resistance markers in patients treated with standard of care checkpoint inhibitors  The study will primarily focus on uncovering mechanisms associated with lack of response to Immuno Oncology  I O  therapies

Bristol Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Another top ranked stock from the same space is Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD    which carries the same rank as Bristol Myers  You can see

201148,422664,GILD,Merck Expands Hep C Drug Market Reach With Idenix Acquisition,news,"By    Merck   Co  NYSE MRK  announced Monday that it will acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ IDIX  for  3 85 billion  to establish a stronger foothold in the market for hepatitis C drugs 
New Jersey based vaccine maker Merck said that it will pay  24 50 a share in cash  which is 3 4 times the value of Idenix stock  which closed at  7 23 on Friday  The deal will allow the  169 billion company to add an Idenix product to two of its own hepatitis C drugs  and help move the drugs to market within the next two years and directly compete with Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD   which makes Sovaldi  the current leader in hepatitis C treatment  and has been accused of patent infringement by Idenix and Merck separately 
 Idenix has established a promising portfolio of hepatitis C candidates   Roger Perlmutter  president of Merck Research Laboratories said  in a company statement released Monday  adding   Idenix s investigational hepatitis C candidates complement our promising therapies in development and will help advance our work to develop a highly effective  once daily  all oral  ribavirin free  pan genotypic regimen that has a duration of treatment as short as possible for millions of patients in need around the world  
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter and help reduce the treatment period for hepatitis C to between eight to 12 weeks  down from the current year long treatment regimen  More than 150 million people worldwide suffer from hepatitis C  for which no vaccine is currently available  while three million Americans suffer from the disease  which primarily affects the liver 
Last year  Merck announced that it is conducting third stage clinical trials for two of its mixed drugs for hepatitis C  and is trying to get them to market in the next two years  And  access to the Idenix drug will reportedly allow Merck to devise a treatment that will keep different versions of the virus in check for more than four weeks  and limit dosage to once a day  Perlmutter told the New York Times s DealBook blog 

 My belief is that a three drug regimen will work even faster   Perlmutter said  according to the Times  adding   We are betting  I m betting  that through this transaction we will be able to demonstrate superiority to any other regimen  
Last week  German pharmaceuticals major Bayer decided to buy Merck s consumer care business for  14 2 billion and expects to close the transaction by the end of this year  Merck  which stands to lose exclusivity on a number of its patents  eliminated 8 500 jobs last October

201173,422689,GILD,Gilead  GILD  Announces Data On CAR T Therapy Candidate ,opinion,"Kite  a Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   company  announced updated results from a phase I II study  ZUMA 3  on experimental candidate KTE X19 at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology  ASH  
KTE C19 is a CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T  CAR T  cell therapy being evaluated in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL   ZUMA 3 is an ongoing multicenter  registrational phase I II study in adult patients   18  with ALL 
In the study  69  of evaluable patients  n 25 36  achieved complete tumor remission  defined as complete remission  CR  or CR with incomplete hematological recovery  CRi   with a median follow up of 15 1 months  range 3 7   28 6 months  following a single infusion of KTE X19  The rate of undetectable minimal residual disease  MRD  in patients who achieved complete tumor remission was 100  
Adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR T treatment  including Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome  CRS  and neurologic events in 23   n 10 44  and 39   n 17 44  of patients  respectively  However  two patients died due to adverse events 
Based on these data  Gilead initiated a phase II study  evaluating KTE X19 in a larger set of adult patients with ALL 
We note that the candidate was added to Gilead s portfolio following the acquisition of Kite Pharma in 2017  Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy  having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a CAR or an engineered T cell receptor  TCR  depending on the type of cancer 
The approval of lead candidate Yescarta for the treatment of refractory aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma  which includes diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL   transformed follicular lymphoma  TFL  and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma  PMBCL   was a significant boost for Gilead 
Gilead s stock has gained 2 7  in the past six months  worse than the s decline of 6 5  

 
Given the persistent decline in HCV sales  Gilead is banking on HIV and newer avenues to help the top line  The initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging but it will take some time for sales to contribute significantly to the top line  given the high cost of treatment  Moreover  Novartis    NYSE NVS   Kymriah is also in the market  posing competition 
Going forward  Gilead will have to generate substantial revenues from its HIV franchise to offset the HCV sales decline  This will be a challenging task for the company with stiff competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   in the HIV market  Gilead has promising late stage candidates   selonsertib and filgotinib   in the NASH and inflammation markets  The company also has a collaboration agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SGMO   to use Sangamo s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology

The drug has been approved for the treatment of HCV infection genotype 1 6 infection in adults and adolescents aged 12 18 years 
The approval should boost sales of the dwindling HCV franchise due to competitive pressure from the likes of AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   
Concurrently  Gilead announced that the NMPA has also approved Descovy  emtricitabine 200 mg tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg  F TAF   a fixed dose combination for the treatment of HIV  Descovy is approved in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV 1 in adults and adolescents  aged 12 years or older with at least 35 kg body weight   The therapy is already approved in the United States

O Day will take over the reins on Mar 1  2019  Meanwhile  the board appointed Gregg Alton as interim CEO for the period of Jan 1 to Mar 1  2019 
O Day is the CEO of the pharmaceutical arm of Roche Holdings   OTC RHHBY   since 2012  Prior to 2012  O Day was heading Roche Diagnostics 
The appointment of a veteran leader like O Day should relieve wary investors as the new CEO will bring leadership experience across multiple therapeutic areas  which is much needed at Gilead 
Gilead has been facing turbulent times lately  and hence O Day has a tough job in his hands  Gilead s stock has lost 4 4  in the past six months  against the s decline of 12 7  

 
Gilead was once a market outperformer  with its strong HCV franchise boasting a number of blockbuster drugs  However  the HCV franchise has been under pressure since the last three four years due to competitive pressure from the likes of AbbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV

201208,422724,GILD,TESARO Shares Rally On Rumors Of Potential Acquisition Offer,opinion,"Shares of TESARO  Inc    NASDAQ TSRO   rallied more than 15  on Tuesday on rumors that it may have received a buyout offer  According to a Bloomberg  published on Nov 16  the company is working with financial advisers for a potential sale by designing a deal and pursuing prospective suitors  The acquisition rumors were strengthened further by TESARO s announcement yesterday that it will not attend an upcoming conference  as stated in a Motley Fool   Generally  companies cancel participation at important events if there are some potential strategic activities underway like a possible sale The Bloomberg report also states that the consistent decline in the share price of TESARO has made it significantly cheaper  Consequently  any company with focus on oncology will be able to make a buyout offer  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  is being looked at as a potential buyer  TESARO s market valuation stands at  2 3 billion as of Nov 20 TESARO s shares have slumped 49 4  so far this year compared with the  s decline of 6 2   Shares of the company have been declining owing to rising competition in the PARP inhibitor segment  TESARO s marketed product portfolio consist of a single product  Zejula  It is a PARP inhibitor which is approved as maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer irrespective of BRCA mutation  Although the drug has seen strong uptake since its launch  the rising competition and the stagnating market share of PARP inhibitors in the ovarian cancer market is a concern  AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   and Merck s   NYSE MRK   Lynparza and Clovis Oncology s   NASDAQ CLVS   Rubraca compete with Zejula in the PARP inhibitor segment With these four companies duking it out for market share in the segment  all of them are trying to develop their respective drugs in additional indications  This increases the operating expenses for these companies  consequently hurting margins  However  we note that Lynparza is being developed by two of the large cap pharmaceuticals companies which have a huge capital to continue clinical studies in several indications  Meanwhile  Clovis and TESARO have a single product in their marketed portfolio and depend on it for revenues  This is likely to impact their cash position significantly if the drugs cannot perform well  High cash burn and low revenues will continue to hurt these companies over the long haul We remind investors that AstraZeneca s label expansion application for Lynparza in first line maintenance treatment for advanced ovarian cancer  the largest ovarian cancer market  received priority review earlier this month  Although the other two companies are also developing their drugs in the first line setting  they will fall behind Lynparza as their studies are expected to complete in 2019 or beyond  This is likely to make gaining market share in the first line setting more competitive for these two drugs Moreover  Clovis and TESARO have to pay royalties on the sales of their drugs to Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Merck  respectively  under a license agreement  Any modification to these agreements can also hamper the prospect of these companies Consequently  a buyout offer from any large pharmaceutical company for TESARO will be a significant relief for its investors as they can sell their stake in the company at a higher price  Any buyout offer gives a premium to the current stock price as we have seen in several blockbuster deals concluded in 2018 Any confirmed offer for TESARO is likely to boost buyout potential of Clovis which may fuel a rally in the latter s stock price as well  Investors should remain focused on news on these two companies to see how things pan out TESARO  Inc  Price

201209,422725,GILD,Should Value Investors Consider Gilead  GILD  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Gilead has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Gilead s current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 45 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Gilead has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Gilead stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Gilead has a P S ratio of about 4 0  While this is a bit higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  GILD is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Gilead currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Gilead a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 1  which is far better than the industry average of 15 1  Clearly  GILD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Gilead might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F  This gives GILD a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen eleven upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 8 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 4 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Gilead Sciences  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGilead is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 35   and a top Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Gilead Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7

The global  double blind  randomized phase III study evaluated the Opdivo Yervoy combination and Opdivo monotherapy versus placebo as a maintenance therapy in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer  SCLC  without disease progression after completion of first line platinum based chemotherapy 
The study did not meet primary endpoint of overall survival  OS   However  no new safety signals were observed 
We remind investors that Opdivo is already approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic SCLC with progression after platinum based chemotherapy and at least one other line of therapy 
A potential label expansion of the drug would have boosted sales  Bristol Myers  stock has decreased 11 7   against the  growth of 10 4  

 
Nevertheless  Opdivo is already approved in the United States for RCC  The drug is approved for several indications in the United States and Europe  It became the first PD 1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy   classical Hodgkin lymphoma  Opdivo obtained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck   SCCHN   with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy 
The European Commission   EC   also approved Opdivo as a monotherapy for the treatment of SCCHN in adults progressing on or after platinum based therapy in April 2017  The drug has been performing impressively  owing to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications  including melanoma  renal cell carcinoma and second line non small cell lung cancer   NSCLC    The FDA also approved the drug for intravenous use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma   HCC   who have been previously treated with Nexavar 
However  Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck s   NYSE MRK   anti PD 1 therapy  Keytruda  which is approved in the first line lung cancer setting  Also  Roche s   OTC RHHBY   anti PDL1 immunotherapy  Tecentriq is approved for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC

We note that the drug is already approved for SAA for patients who have had an insufficient response to IST 
The drug is marketed as Revolade in most countries outside the United States  Promacta is already approved for adults and children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia  ITP  who are refractory to other treatments  and for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection 
The approval was based on encouraging results from a study sponsored by the National Heart  Lung and Blood Institute  NHLBI  Division of Intramural Research Program and conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement  CRADA  
In addition  Novartis submitted a type II variation application for Revolade as a first line SAA treatment to the European Medicines Agency in April 2018  A decision is expected in 2019 
Moreover  the FDA also granted Promacta Breakthrough Therapy designation as a counter measure for hematopoietic sub syndrome of acute radiation syndrome  H ARS  
Concurrently  Novartis announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  of the European Medicines Agency  EMA  has adopted a positive opinion for the label expansion of breast cancer drug Kisqali

The approval was supported by data from two international phase III studies  Studies 108 and 110  among 1 632 treatment naive and treatment experienced adult patients with HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive HBV disease  Importantly  Vemlidy  a targeted prodrug of tenofovir  has demonstrated antiviral efficacy similar to Viread 300 mg but at one tenth of the dose  The drug has greater plasma stability and delivers tenofovir more efficiently to hepatocytes compared to Viread 
Vemlidy demonstrated improved renal and bone laboratory safety parameters compared to Viread 
We remind investors that Vemlidy is already approved by the FDA and in Japan  The drug was approved in European Commission in 2017 
The market potential in China is quite significant  Per the market  an estimated 20 million patients meet current guidelines for therapy  accounting for almost one third of all patients currently requiring therapy worldwide  Approximately 300 000 people in China die from cirrhosis of the liver related to HBV each year 
Last month  Gilead reported third quarter earnings  which beat estimates  However  earnings and revenues declined year over year as the magnitude of decline in hepatitis C virus  HCV  sales continues to deepen 
While the company plans to launch authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States in January 2019 through a newly created subsidiary  Asegua Therapeutics LLC  the HCV franchise sales are expected to decline further 
Given the persistent decline in HCV sales  the company is looking to HIV and newer avenues to help the top line  The initial uptake of Yescarta  from the Kite Pharma acquisition  is also encouraging but it will take some time for sales to contribute significantly to the top line  given the high cost of treatment  Moreover  Novartis    NYSE NVS   Kymriah is also there in the market  posing competition 
Gilead s stock has gained 3 9  in the past six months  compare to the  s decline of 10 1  

 
Gilead has promising late stage candidates in the NASH and inflammation market  like selonsertib and filgotinib  The company also has a collaboration agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SGMO   to use Sangamo s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology 
Going forward  Gilead will have to generate substantial revenues from its HIV franchise  to offset the HCV sales decline  This will be a challenging task for the company with stiff competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   in the HIV market

201249,422765,GILD,Aerie  AERI  Q3 Earnings Miss  Rhopressa Gains Traction,opinion,"Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AERI   lost 6 4   following the company s third quarter results 
Aerie s shares have lost 16 5  in the year so far compared with the  s  s decline of 2 4  

 
Aerie reported third quarter 2018 loss of  1 73 per share  wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 33 and the year ago loss of 71 cents  The wider than expected loss was on account of higher operating costs related to the launch of lead drug  Rhopressa 
Quarter in Detail
In December 2017  Rhopressa was approved by the FDA for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  This approval came two months ahead of the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28  2018  The drug was launched by the end of April 
Rhopressa s revenues came in at  7 3 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29 8  
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses more than doubled to  28 5 million  Selling  general and administrative expenses surged to  39 9 million from  19 8 million in the year ago quarter 
Also  operating expenses were higher in the reported quarter  primarily due to increased activities associated with the expansion of the employee base to support growth of operations and activities associated with Rhopressa commercialization efforts 
Aerie is securing formulary contracts to enable commercial coverage in 2018 and Medicare Part D coverage in 2019  As of Oct 1  2018  Rhopressa s market access increased to approximately 85   up from 80  as last reported  of commercial lives  including 45  in Tier 3 and 40  in preferred brand Tier 2  Medicare Part D coverage is now 40  in Tier 2 
Pipeline Updates
Aerie s New Drug Application  NDA  for its second product candidate  Rocklatan  netarsudil latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0 02  0 005   which is a fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer s  PFE  Xalatan  was submitted to the FDA in May 2018  The agency has completed its initial 60 day review of the NDA and determined that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review  The PDUFA  Prescription Drug User Fee Act  goal date for the completion of the FDA s review of the Rocklatan NDA is set for Mar 14  2019 
In early October 2018  the European Medicines Agency  EMA  accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application  MAA  for Rhokiinsa  marketed as Rhopressa in the United States   An opinion on approval is expected in the second half of 2019 
Earlier  the company initiated a phase III trial  Mercury 3  in the third quarter of 2017 to prepare for a regulatory submission in Europe  The trial is a non inferiority trial comparing Roclatan with prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort 
Pre IND activities are well underway for further development of Aerie s retina program candidates  including AR 13503  Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor implant  and AR 1105  dexamethasone steroid implant   Both are expected to enter clinic in 2019 
Outlook Reiterated
Aerie expects Rhopressa s revenues to be  20  30 million in 2018 
Our Take
The wider Q3 loss was primarily due to higher expenses as the company strives to commercialize Rhopressa  Nevertheless  Rhopressa sales comfortably beat estimates  The solid uptake in prescription volumes should propel sales further as glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market  even though competition is stiff from the likes of Bausch Health s  BHC  Vyzulta  among others 
Finally  a tentative approval of Rocklatan  early next year  will further boost prospects of the company

201250,422766,GILD,Endo  ENDP  Stock Declines Despite Q3 Earnings   Revenue Beat,opinion,"Shares of Endo International plc   NASDAQ ENDP   fell 17 7  even after the company reported better than expected results for the third quarter 2018 results and raised its annual guidance 
The year over year decline continues to deepen  Moreover  investors were also disappointed with the company s plans to launch its cellulite treatment in 2020 
Nevertheless  Endo s stock has gained 70 2  in the year so far  against the  s 3 8  decline 

 
Earnings from continuing operations were 71 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents  However  earnings declined from 91 cents recorded in the year ago quarter 
Revenues came in at  745 million in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  696 9 million  However  the top line was down 5  year over year due to competitive pressures and product discontinuations in the U S  Generic Pharmaceutical segment  divestiture of the company s Mexican business named Somar  and the voluntary market withdrawal of OpanaER 
Quarterly Highlights
Endo now has four reportable business segments   1  U S  Generic Pharmaceuticals   2  U S  Branded   Specialty   Established Pharmaceuticals   3  U S  Branded Sterile Injectables and  4  International Pharmaceuticals 
U S  Generic Pharmaceuticals recorded sales of  258 million in the quarter  down 12  due to competitive pressures in the generic business and previously announced product discontinuations  partially offset by the launch of colchicine tablets  We note that in July 2018  Endo launched colchicine tablets  the authorized generic of Colcrys 
U S  Branded Pharmaceuticals  Specialty   Established Pharmaceuticals  sales were down 6  to  220 1 million due to cessation of product shipments of Opana ER in the third quarter of 2017  Specialty Products revenues increased 13   driven by strong performance of Xiaflex   Xiaflex sales increased 22  year over year  reflecting strong volume growth of the product for the indication of Dupuytren s Contracture and Peyronie s Disease 
The company also reported positive results from two phase III trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum  CCH  for the treatment of cellulite in the buttocks  The results demonstrated that subjects receiving CCH showed highly statistically significant levels of improvement in the appearance of cellulite with treatment  as measured by the trial s primary endpoint 
Additionally  the RELEASE 1 study passed all the eight key secondary endpoints and the RELEASE 2 study passed seven out of eight key secondary endpoints  Regulatory and pre commercialization activities are already underway and the company targets a market launch in the second half of 2020 
U S  Branded Sterile Injectables  sales of  237 1 million was up 17   driven by strong growth of Adrenalin  up 40   and Vasostrict  up 6    In July  the segment launched ertapenem for injection  the authorized generic of Merck s   NYSE MRK   Invanz  which boosted sales 
In April  Endo entered into definitive agreements to acquire Somerset Therapeutics  LLC  a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets sterile injectable and ophthalmic drugs for the U S  market  and the business of its affiliate Wintac Limited  which operates as Somerset Therapeutics  contract developer and manufacturer  The acquisitions will close in the first quarter of 2019  
Endo also entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Nevakar  a specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple assets in the ophthalmic and injectable areas  Both companies have collaborated for the development of five differentiated  sterile injectable products in the United States and Canada  While Nevakar will develop and seek FDA approval for these products  Endo s Par Pharmaceuticals Sterile Products division will launch and distribute them upon approval 
The International Pharmaceuticals division generated sales of  30 2 million  down from  56 4 million in the year ago quarter due to recent divestitures  Endo sold Mexican subsidiary Somar to Advent International in October 2017  Endo also sold its South African subsidiary  Litha Healthcare Group in July 2017 
2018 Outlook Updated
Endo now expects revenues between  2 87 billion and  2 92 billion in 2018  earlier estimate   2 75 billion and  2 85 billion   The company expects Xiaflex s full year revenue growth to be in the low 20s  earlier estimate  high teens percentage range  
Branded Sterile Injectables revenues are now expected to grow in the low 20  range  U S  Generics revenues for 2018 are projected to decline in the mid 30s percentage range  International Pharmaceuticals is estimated to decline approximately 40  
The company anticipates earnings from continuing operations to be  2 65  2 75 per share  earlier estimate   2 50  2 60  
Our Take
Endo s third quarter results were driven by continued momentum in Xiaflex and sterile injectables  Xiaflex s performance was outstanding  propelled by demand  The company is in the process of redefining its business  given the persistent decline in the Generic business  which is expected to face challenges 
The focus now is on sterile injectables and Xiaflex  The U S  Branded Sterile Injectables and U S  Generics Pharmaceuticals segments collectively launched 10 new products year to date 
However  investors were not much impressed with the year over year decline in earnings and revenues  The huge level of debt is a concern   Moreover  response rates from the CCH trials did not impress the investors either

201291,422807,GILD,CRISPR Science And Stocks  Knowing Enough To Invest ,opinion,"By far the most exciting real time revolution unfolding in Biotechnology is CRISPR gene editing  And the past few months have provided plenty of excitement for Biotech investors as the three public companies who are pure play manifestations of the technology have made some dramatic moves    on good news and bad 
For instance  on June 11  two scientific research studies were published that suggested CRISPR gene editing could actually enable cancer growth  Shares of the biggest of the three companies  CRISPR Therapeutics   NASDAQ CRSP    dropped over 20  on that scary news of  gene editing gone wrong  
After reading scientist  analyst  and company reactions to understand the controversy and its implications  I decided it was actually a buying opportunity for investors who follow my picks in Zacks Healthcare Innovators  where we also own the other two players Editas Medicine   NASDAQ EDIT   and Intellia Therapeutics   NASDAQ NTLA   
For a good explanation of why I saw that fear driven reaction as an excellent opportunity for investors who appreciate a good calculated risk  check out the video I made on June 18   

From  Revolutionary Breakthrough  to  Dangerous Science 
And this is not the first time a news or research scare has made the stock go from over loved to well hated  In January  there were papers being debated about whether CRISPR could cause  off target  edits  accidentally modifying other genes not related to a given targeted disease 
But this  collateral damage  view was found within a few months to be based on inconclusive research 
Beyond the scientific unknowns of this  power of God  technology  there is another landmine for investors  the three companies  and their respective partner research institutions or universities  are all in a giant patent dispute over who discovered what  and when  and who lays claim to which new developments 
What Exactly is CRISPR 
In the video that accompanies this article  I go over some of the basic scientific facts and assumptions of CRISPR that make it such a revolutionary discovery for potentially curing thousands of genetic diseases 
What s so fascinating about CRISPR is that it wasn t invented in a lab like some pharmaceutical drug  It was discovered in nature 
Rather than try to explain it in my own words and probably butcher it  let s hear from one of the experts  CRISPR Therapeutics  from their website    
CRISPR Cas9 is a rapid and easy to use gene editing technology that can selectively delete  modify or correct a disease causing abnormality in a specific DNA segment 
CRISPR refers to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats occurring in the genome of certain bacteria  from which the system was discovered  Cas9 is a CRISPR associated endonuclease  an enzyme   the  molecular scissors  that are easily programmed to cut and edit  or correct  disease associated DNA in a patient s cell 
The clustered repeats of CRISPR were discovered by accident in 1987 by researchers studying bacterial defense mechanisms  specifically how bacteria deal with foreign plasmids and phages  Bacteria have the ability to open and alter the genomes of invading viruses with a nuclease called Cas9  inactivating them in the process  The clustered repeats were given the name CRISPR in 2002 and multiple CRISPR associated  Cas  genes were discovered adjacent to the repeat elements in that same year 
A New Science for Treating Disease  Courtesy of Good Ole Bacteria
CRISPR could be summed up as simply as this  a protein named Cas9 found in the streptococcus bacteria attacks the DNA of an invading virus by slicing it up  In essence  the prey becomes the predator  Mother nature worked on this for billions of years  She must know something 
That is the crux of what you want to remember here about CRISPR Cas  scientists have learned from bacteria    nature s warriors of survival and her ninjas of adaptation    how they utilize proteins to alter the genetic structure of invading viruses  and thereby how we can use Cas9 to  edit  genetic material 
Because of its ability to modify a cell s DNA with amazing precision  CRISPR and its evolving variations    a new enzyme called Cas13 was recently discovered that could be less error prone    will be a hot arena for science and medical innovation for decades to come 
Mother nature indeed knows things  In fact  most scientists believe we are just scratching the surface of what will be discovered this century  So it may be premature to call CRISPR  the discovery of the century  when we ve got over 80 years left 
And investors should also be aware of different types of gene editing  Last July  I gave Zacks Confidential subscribers a special report on  Gene Editing  How to Invest   There we picked Sangamo Therapeutics   NASDAQ SGMO   as a potential winner with its technology called zinc finger nuclease  ZFN   We rode SGMO to 155  gains this year after Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   and its KITE subsidiary created a  3 billion R D partnership with Sangamo 
For my latest report on gene editing from April titled   you can email  and one of our account reps will help you out 
That report gives more background on all the companies plus a peek at the new Cas13 threat 
Disclosure  I own shares of CRSP  NTLA  EDIT  SGMO  and GILD for the  portfolio  While it is designed as a long term portfolio  I may occasionally swing trade in or out of some highly volatile stocks

201292,422808,GILD,Gilead Sciences Stock Ripe For A Pre Earnings Options Trade,opinion,"Earnings season is kicking into high gear  with several blue chips on tap to report this week  Stocks have the tendency to make volatile moves after a company s earnings report  and those looking for a potential trading opportunity may want to consider hepatitis specialist Gilead Sciences  Inc   NASDAQ GILD   which has tended to exceed volatility expectations over the past year    a boon to would be premium buyers 
Taking a quick step back  GILD is scheduled to report second quarter earnings after the market closes next Wednesday  July 25  Over the past eight quarters  the drug stock has averaged a single session post earnings move of 4 3   regardless of direction  Overall  though  most of these reactions have been unfavorable  with six of those post earnings returns being negative over the two year time frame 
Those contemplating a pre earnings options trade on GILD may want to consider a premium buying strategy  such as a straddle  This is based on the stock s elevated Schaeffer s Volatility Scorecard  SVS  reading of 83  out of a possible 100  This means the equity has made outsized moves relative to what the options market has expected  looking back 12 months

201293,422809,GILD,CEO Departure At Gilead Sciences Upstages Good Second Quarter Results,opinion,"The big biotech announced great momentum for its new HIV drug  a hint at HCV sales stabilization  and news that its CEO is stepping down 
As Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD  announcement of its second quarter earnings approached  there were three big things investors were looking to see  One was any sign that the company s hepatitis C virus  HCV  franchise sales might have begun to stabilize  Another was how well new HIV drug Biktarvy performed  And investors also hoped that the rest of the big biotech s HIV lineup held up against the competition 
Gilead answered all those questions when it provided an update of its second quarter performance after the market closed on Wednesday  but it also raised a new question  Here are the highlights from the company s second quarter results 

What happened with Gilead Sciences this quarter 
Although Gilead s HCV revenue fell more than 65  year over year to  1 billion  the more important comparison to look at is second quarter sales versus first quarter sales  The quarter over quarter decline was only 4 4     much better than the 30  quarter over quarter drop that Gilead reported in May 2018  It looks as if the long awaited stabilization in HCV revenue might be very close 
The brightest spot in Gilead s second quarter results was the performance of Biktarvy  Gilead s new HIV drug raked in  185 million in its first full quarter on the market  and all but  2 million of that total was made in the United States  As European sales also ramp up  Gilead should soon have its next blockbuster HIV drug 
Thanks in part to Biktarvy s successful launch  the biotech s total HIV sales in the second quarter increased 15 6  year over year to  3 7 billion  But Gilead s other TAF based HIV drugs also helped tremendously  Sales for Genvoya jumped 35  from the prior year period to  1 16 billion  Percentage sales growth for Descovy and Odefsey was even more impressive  with sales for Descovy increasing nearly 41  year over year to  403 million and sales for Odefsey jumping 49  year over year to  385 million 
Gilead s older HIV drugs  including Truvada  Atripla  and Stribild  saw sales drop from the prior year period  However  these declines were expected with generic competition in Europe and the ascendence of the company s own TAF based drugs 
Yescarta  the chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy picked up with Gilead s acquisition of Kite Pharma last year  generated revenue of  68 million during the second quarter  That s up from  40 million in sales for Yescarta in the first quarter of 2018 
Revenue from Gilead s other drugs fell 13 4  year over year to  807 million  The primary factor behind this decline was significantly lower sales for hepatitis B virus drug Viread 
Gilead s other big news
Overall  Gilead s second quarter results were pretty good despite the poor comparisons with the prior year period  However  investors might have reeled a bit from the company s other news  CEO John Milligan is stepping down at the end of 2018 
Milligan was named CEO of Gilead in March 2016 and has been with the company for 28 years  A tenure of fewer than three years at the helm was definitely unexpected 
Milligan stated   It has been an honor to work at Gilead for my entire professional career  and now that the company is on solid footing for the future  the board and I have agreed it is a good time to turn the reins over to a new leader   He added   I m looking forward to a well deserved break and will then move on to new and different opportunities  
In addition  John Martin  former Gilead CEO and current chairman of the board  announced that he will step down from the company s board of directors at the end of the year  Martin felt that  this would be a natural transition point from his successive roles as CEO  executive chairman  and chairman   according to Gilead s press release about Milligan s upcoming departure 
Looking forward
In Gilead s first quarter conference call  CFO Robin Washington said 2018 would be a  trough year  for the company  The biotech s second quarter results hint that Gilead might now begin moving past the bottom of the trough on its way to renewed growth 
Investors can look forward to continued momentum for Biktarvy and Gilead s newer HIV drugs  It now seems that the worst for the company s HCV franchise could be over  Gilead also should report results for its promising immunology drug  filgotinib  in the near future 
But probably the biggest thing to watch now is whom Gilead will hire as its new CEO  Regardless of who it is  the person should inherit a company with better prospects than would have been the case a year ago

201313,422829,GILD,Gilead Collaborates With Hookipa For HBV And HIV Therapies,opinion,"Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Hookipa Biotech AG  Per the agreement  Gilead will own exclusive rights to Hookipa s TheraT and Vaxwave arenavirus vector based immunization technologies for two major chronic infectious disease indications  hepatitis B virus  HBV  and human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   While research work will be carried out by both  Hookipa will manufacture arenavirus based vectors for clinical development by Gilead 
In exchange  Gilead will provide an upfront payment of  10 million  In addition  Hookipa will be eligible to receive payments up to a total of more than  400 million based upon the achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercial milestones  Moreover  Gilead will fund all research and development activities  Hookipa will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales 
The agreement further expands the relationship between Hookipa and Gilead following Gilead s participation in Hookipa s Series C financing in Dec 2017   Hookipa s unique therapeutic vaccine technology demonstrated excellent safety and immunogenicity in phase I studies 
Gilead is banking on its HIV franchise to drive growth in future  given the persistent decline in HCV sales  Gilead s stock has lost 3 0  in the last six months as against the s loss of 5 2  

 
Gilead s HCV franchise witnessed slowdown across key markets  including the United States and Europe  reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure  The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts  
Pricing has largely stabilized and market share will stabilize by mid 2018  while patient starts are expected to decline further  We note that Harvoni  Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak and Mayret  and Merck s   NYSE MRK   Zepatier among others 
Meanwhile  Gilead is looking to newer avenues to help its top line by solidifying its presence in the gene therapy space  The initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging  Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates   selonsertib and filgotinib 
During the first quarter  Gilead announced an agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SGMO   to use Sangamo s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology

201315,422831,GILD,NASH Space In Focus As Galmed  GLMD  Posts Positive Data ,opinion,The NASH or the non alcoholic steatohepatitis space is back in focus as Israel based Galmed Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GLMD   reported positive data on its candidate  Aramchol  The candidate demonstrated statistically significant reduction in liver fat at 52 weeks  A larger number of patients treated with Aramchol 600mg showed NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the 52 week biopsy   This encouraging data boosted investor sentiment  leading to the stock s significant surge Of late  the NASH space has been under the spotlight given its market potential   The market for NASH is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative yet saturated markets like cancer What is NASH A chronic liver disease  NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver  known as steatosis  Per records  it has affected up to 15 million people in the United Stated and could cause inflammation  hepatocellular injury  progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis  The ailment is anticipated to be the leading reason behind liver transplantation by 2020  Currently  NASH induces the biggest basis for liver transplants in people under 50 in the United States  Such patients also suffer obesity and type II diabetes With no treatments currently approved to address this disease  the market opportunity is substantially huge and many companies are investing a major chunk of their R D spend in the same Let us consider the companies with potential candidates presently being evaluated for the treatment of NASH 5 Stocks With Promising NASH Candidates in Their PipelineMadrigal Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ MDGL    Shares of Madrigal Pharmaceuticals soared last month after the company reported positive top

thyroid hormone receptor  THR    selective agonist  Data from the study showed that MGL 3196 achieved higher reduction in NAFLD activity score  NAS  and greater NASH resolution in patients with 30  or more liver fat reduction achievement at week 12  The candidate had met the primary endpoint of 30  or more reduction in liver fat at week 12 last December  The company will advance the candidate to a phase III study following a regulatory agreement on its design Madrigal s stock has skyrocketed 303 3  in the last six months  outperforming the  s rise of 9 2   The company currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see    Gilead Sciences Inc     NASDAQ GILD     Biotech bigwig Gilead is also foraying into the emerging NASH domain with its late stage candidate  selonsertib  to combat the persistent decline in its one time lucrative HCV business  In April 2018  the company announced encouraging data from a proof of concept study of experimental combination therapies for patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH  Apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1  ASK1  inhibitor  selonsertib  was combined with either the Acetyl CoA carboxylase  ACC  inhibitor  GS 0976  or the selective  non steroidal Farnesoid X receptor  FXR  agonist  GS 9674  as therapies  Gilead s NASH pipeline includes selonsertib  GS 9674 and GS 0976  alone and in combination with one other  Favorable results suggest that the combination therapy with selonsertib and either GS 0976 or GS 9674 can be evaluated further in patients with NASH and F3 and F4 fibrosis  Gilead s stock has lost 3 5  in the last six months compared with the s decline of 6 2   Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT    Intercept is another company  pumping its resources into the NASH space  The company is evaluating its lead candidate  obeticholic acid  OCA   for treating NASH  OCA achieved the primary endpoint in a phase IIb trial  FLINT   Currently  a phase III study  REGENERATE  among non cirrhotic NASH patients with liver fibrosis is ongoing  Top line results from its interim analysis are expected in the first half of 2019  Intercept also initiated a phase III trial  REVERSE  on OCA   The randomized phase III study will examine the efficacy and safety of OCA on subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH in approximately 540 patients with a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis  Intercept expects to submit marketing authorization for OCA as a treatment option for NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis in the United States and international markets on the basis of the positive results from the study  A subsequent outcome trial is also in the cards to confirm the clinical benefit on a post marketing basis across a broader population of NASH patients with cirrhosis  OCA is already approved as Ocaliva in combination with ursodeoxycholic  UDCA  for the therapy of primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in adults unable to recuperate with UDCA Intercept s stock has surged 32 6  over a year versus the s decline of 6 2   Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ CNAT    Conatus also has a promising NASH candidate in its pipeline  The company is developing emricasan  a first in class  orally active pan caspase protease inhibitor  for the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease  Conatus currently has three ongoing studies  namely ENCORE PH  ENCORE NF and ENCORE LF  evaluating emricasan for NASH patients  The company has a collaboration agreement with Swiss major Novartis for the global development and commercialization of products containing emricasan either as a single active ingredient or in combination with other Novartis compounds for liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis  Although emricasan failed in a phase IIB study   POLT HCV SVR   when it did not achieve the primary endpoint in patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis undergoing liver transplant  investors will still keenly follow data from multiple NASH studies   Data from the ongoing trials are likely to be received by this year end and 2019  A positive outcome will surely boost growth prospects for the company The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Conatus  stock has rallied 25 7  in the last six months  outperforming the 11 3  increase recorded by the    Galectin Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ GALT   is another company with a late

development program is in NASH with cirrhosis  the most advanced form of NASH related fibrosis  In May  the company announced that it will initiate a phase III trial with its galectin 3 inhibitor GR MD 02 in NASH cirrhosis  incorporating advice and guidance obtained from a meeting with the FDA   The target population of the trial comprises patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices Galectin currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its stock has gained by a staggering 227 2  in the last six months  outperforming the  s growth of 9 4   Bottom LineRiding high on the vast market

the last few months  The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed  The threat of generic competition is also looming large

Biktarvy combines the novel  unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor   INSTI   bictegravir  with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy   FTC TAF  dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor   NRTI   backbone and is the smallest INSTI based triple therapy STR available  The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith s   NYSE GSK   existing therapies  Tivicay and Triumeq 
Gilead s stock has returned 10 9  in the last twelve months compared with the   loss of 8 9  

 
Gilead has a decent track record  with the company s earnings beating estimates in three of the last four while missing in one  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings beat expectations by 4 7   Overall  the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7 5   We expect the strength in the HIV franchise to offset the HCV franchise weakness making it highly likely for the company to beat on earnings in the first quarter   Read more

201360,422876,GILD,Is A Beat In The Cards For Agios  AGIO  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,We expect Agios Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AGIO   to surpass expectations when it reports first quarter 2018 results on May 4  before the market opens  Last reported quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9 70  Shares of Agios have soared 67 7  in a year s time  comparing favorably with the  s increase of 12 5   The company s earnings track record shows mixed results with the company having outpaced estimates twice in the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two  Overall  Agios came up with an average negative surprise of 1 34  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this quarter Factors at PlayAgios  only marketed drug is Idhifa  enasidenib   which received an FDA approval last August for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia  R R AML  having an isocitrate dehydrogenase 2  IDH2  mutation  Per the last report  the drug generated strong sales and we expect encouraging revenues in the first quarter as well Moreover  Agios  progress with the pipeline has been quite impressive  In fact  investors  focus will remain on the same in the to be reported quarter  Two interesting candidates in the company s cancer portfolio are IDH1 mutant inhibitor  AG 120  ivosidenib  and a pan IDH mutant inhibitor  AG 881 Ivosidenib is under priority review in the United States for treating patients with R R AML with an IDH1 mutation  An approval for ivosidenib is expected in the third quarter of 2018  Additionally  the company anticipates a regulatory filing for the candidate in the EU during the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in phase I study for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies and combined with Celgene s   NASDAQ CELG   Vidaza  it is under assessment in phase I II  for the cure of newly diagnosed AML patients  who are not eligible for an intensive chemotherapy Meanwhile  Agios is conducting phase I programs on AG 881 for treating patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant positive solid tumors including glioma  In the second half of 2017  the company announced positive findings from the study Notably  the company also plans to initiate a perioperative window trial to analyze ivosidenib and AG 881 in low grade glioma for investigating the effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018 The company has another interesting candidate in its portfolio  Its lead rare genetic diseases candidate  AG 348  is under evaluation in a phase II trial on adult  transfusion independent patients with Pyruvate kinase deficiency  Agios reported positive data from the program in June 2017  The FDA granted a fast track designation to the candidate for the given indication  As the RGD market still remains unexplored  newer therapies in this area hold huge potential Nonetheless  this March  Agios announced commencement of a phase I study  evaluating its first in class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a  MAT2A  inhibitor  AG 270  for patients with solid tumors or lymphoma with deletion of the MTAP  We expect management to produce an update on the same in first quarter earnings release Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Agios is likely to beat on earnings this reporting cycle because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen Zacks ESP  Agios has an Earnings ESP of  1 72   representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate  loss of  1 57 per share  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  loss of  1 60   A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Agios has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP and together with a positive ESP  chances of an earnings beat in the stock s upcoming release are pegged higher We caution against all Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the

201372,422888,GILD,Ready For The Next Wave Of The Biotech Bull ,opinion,"At the start of 2017  I called for a resurgence in the biotechnology bull market that was slowly attempting to recover from its 40  bear market of the prior two years 
In response  my team and I here at Zacks worked to design a new type of portfolio  Healthcare Innovators  to capitalize on the long term trends I saw that would sustain the return of the bull 
What we got was a 34  surge in the Nasdaq Biotech Index  IBB  to January 29 this year  This explosive rally gave us gains like 155  in Sangamo  SGMO   119  in Sarepta  SRPT   and 98  in Juno  JUNO  in a matter of months 
But the current market correction has shown no mercy to any sector and so the volatility and uncertainty prompted me to dig further into the current state of the biotech bull market 
What I found is that the same long term drivers are still in place  As I outlined earlier this week  I call them my  4 megatrends  of healthcare investing   1  an aging population living longer and requiring more care   2  an explosion of scientific discovery from the  genome goldmine  to battle disease   3  powerful earnings leverage from life enhancing technologies  and  4  the highly motivated forces of M A by big BioPharma to acquire new scientific assets and revenue streams 
Continued      
                                                                                                      

Today a  4 trillion dollar industry is being revolutionized by explosive medical advances  the needs of an aging population  demands from insurance companies for alternatives to costly surgical procedures  and more 
Already in 2018  healthcare megatrends like these have led Zacks to wins of  155 6    119 1    75 6   and  98 1  in as little as 5 weeks 
Want to see our next predicted breakouts just as market pullbacks are giving us some exceptional entry points  Special opportunity ends at midnight Sunday  April 8 

                                                                                                      
4 Keys to Play the Biotech Bull
My conclusion remains that the Biotech bull still has a lot more room to go over the next 2 years  And once in a lifetime wealth building opportunities await investors who play the right industries and companies over the next decade  But the rules are different this time in this second big wave of the Bio Bull  You can t simply ride the next hot tip or momentum play  Your research and stock selection must have certain discipline  or else you ll get burned 
Here I share 4 keys in my research process and why they are so important 
1  Investment Bank Research
I read dozens of research reports every week from Wall Street s top investment analysts  Of course  we all know that these analysts are conflicted occasionally as one side of the company is providing advisory or capital underwriting services for a fee  while the  pure research  side is not supposed to be influenced by that business 
But for the most part  there are many good and un conflicted analysts devoted to their research  Many are PhDs in the life sciences  or even have medical degrees  and they care about the quality of their analysis  Reading their reports every week gives me an edge on understanding the most complicated investing in the world 
The payoff here was greater confidence in my thesis to buy Sangamo Therapeutics last year  This was a low risk high reward bet that they would be a game changer in the exciting field of gene editing  We took 155  gains in SGMO in February after Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  created a partnership worth as much as  3 billion to the company as its pipeline developed 
2  Big Brother Partnerships
How do you build a billion dollar business in medicine  Sometimes it takes a few hundred million dollars in R D  That s where big Pharma companies come in to help emerging ones with drug pipeline clinical trials that keep the FDA happy  The big firms are constantly looking for exciting new R D  often before it even leaves university labs 
When I see a big company    whether from traditional Pharma or Biotech    team up with a little guy  I know something good is in the pipeline and I start paying more attention to that potential breakthrough  If  big brother  helps get my target through Phase 2 clinical trials with positive results  the stock may already be on the launch pad 
Knowing the long term commitment of partner Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  to the emerging field of  immuno oncology  gave me the conviction to buy Juno Therapeutics last year in the low  20s  We ended up swing trading JUNO once for 70  gains in August and then made another 98  on Celgene s buyout in January 
3  Medical Journals  Company Presentations  and KOL Circles
There are many great places that new research can be found and company presentations are some of the best  Company scientists know they can t just  pull the wool  over the eyes of Wall Street analysts  When they publish in peer reviewed academic journals or make presentations at industry conferences  there are just as many doctors in the room as number crunchers 
And those presentations often are placed on company websites where I can see the entire slide deck and watch video recordings  This is a great way to not only understand new science but also to be tuned in to the criticism from scientific peers  You can t really understand an R D thesis unless you can also point out its potential flaws 
This brings up a class of expert known as the KOL  or Key Opinion Leader  In BioPharma especially  there are hundreds of doctors and researchers involved at all levels of drug and disease R D whose opinions are widely respected in the global medical community  For doctors at the front lines taking care of their patients  who don t always have time to stay up to date on the latest research  the view of a KOL can often be an important influence in their decision to try a new treatment option 
And it s how I decided to pull the trigger on Sarepta Therapeutics last May as they tackle a unique disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy  SRPT s progress in crossing regulatory hurdles and advancing its pipeline handed us a gain of 119  in March 
4  Institutional Buying and Selling
Lastly  I still like to pay attention to what the big money is doing  There are many fund managers running tens of billions in investment war chests that are ear marked solely for the healthcare field    and some are focused entirely on biotech  like the  15 billion Baker Brothers funds run by the fabulous  real life brothers Julian and Felix 
Many of these managers are some of the most serious and disciplined of medical sector investors  So  I pay attention to what they are buying and selling and I don t mind following their money trail if enough of my other criteria are in line 
My two most fascinating places to  follow the money  right now are in the exciting fields of immuno oncology and gene editing  especially with the CRISPR companies  In my Healthcare Innovators service  I currently own a leader in each field that both saw open portfolio gains of over 100  
During the correction  these two stocks have both given back a chunk of those open profits  But I will continue to hold and accumulate them because their scientific and commercial promise is so strong 
And if there is one thing I have learned from the big and smart money it is this  holding on through volatility is how long term wealth is built in Biotech 
Focus on the Long Term Drivers
To pursue the  megatrends  of healthcare investing  I invite you to join me inside Zacks  investment portfolio  
It s designed to capitalize on those long term drivers  And I am confident that the next wave of the Biotech bull market is about to roll in 
But not all boats will rise with this tide  Using the 4 keys of my research process  we are picking powerful scientific assets  brands  and cash flow franchises that will come out on top for strategic healthcare investors 
That is how  already in 2018  we have closed wins of  155 6    119 1    75 6   and  98 1  in as little as 5 weeks 
Of course  picking the best stocks in this sector requires a considerable amount of research  But you don t have to follow FDA filings or subscribe to medical journals  That s my job  Healthcare Innovators enables you to piggy back on my research  and we ll go after exceptional longer term gains together 
There couldn t be a better time to get started than right now  Recent market pullbacks offer us excellent entry points for stocks with massive gain potential 
Plus  if you check out Healthcare Innovators before midnight Sunday  April 8  you ll get access to Zacks  special report  Making Money on Marijuana  It includes 6 ways to cash in on medical sales in this niche that are expected to nearly triple by 2020  surpassing  13 billion in revenue

Our Take
Intercept s fourth quarter results missed expectations as sales of Ocalive declined due to safety issues reported earlier  While the updated label should help the stock turn around  it might be a while before the sales start to recover  First quarter 2018 is expected to be a transitional quarter 
 

 
Intercept s stock has tumbled 57 8  over a year compared with the  s decline of 2 5    The company s stock has been bearing the brunt of the safety guidelines issued regarding the approved drug Ocaliva 
Given the challenges faced by the drug in recent times  the label expansion of OCA will boost the growth prospects 
Per estimates  NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis C as the leading reason for liver transplants in the United States and Europe  NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva s prospects   However  bigwigs like Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   and Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that can be used to treat PBC  NASH and the other liver diseases

201445,422961,GILD,Novartis Reports Updated Results From Kymriah s JULIET Study	,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   announced updated results from the pivotal JULIET study  It showed sustained complete responses at six months with Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion  in adult patients with a difficult to treat cancer  relapsed or refractory  r r  diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL  
Kymriah  tisagenlecleucel   formerly CTL019  is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell  CAR T  therapy approved   The drug has been developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania  This novel immunocellular therapy and one time treatment uses patient s T cells to fight cancer 
CAR T therapies are developed for individual patients using their own cells  thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies 
So far this year  Novartis  shares have gained 15 2   compared with the  s growth of 15 6  

JULIET is the first multi center global registration study for Kymriah in adult patients with r r DLBCL and the second global CAR T cell therapy trial  In the study at six months  30  of patients treated with Kymriah showed complete response  The relapse free probability at six months after first response was 74   Median overall survival was not achieved and the median time from infusion to data cutoff was 5 6 months  
When the patients with DLBCL enrolled for this study  they had to go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and many had unsuccessful stem cell transplants  leaving them with few options and a poor prognosis  The study showed that Kymriah was able to considerably increase their chance of achieving and maintaining a sustained response without stem cell transplant  thus highlighting its benefit 
Additionally  the study revealed that cytokine release syndrome  CRS  occurred in 58  of the  total patients under treatment while 23  experienced grade 3 4 CRS  15  grade 3  8  grade 4  using the Penn Grading Scale  Also  it showed that 21  of patients experienced any grade neurologic events and 12  of patients had grade 3 4 neurologic adverse events  who were provided supportive care 
In the study  26 patients  26   were infused in the outpatient setting of which 20 patients  77   remained outpatient for three or more days after infusion 43 patients discontinued before infusiondue to rapid progression of their disease or deterioration in their clinical status 
According to the study  only nine out of 147  6 1   enrolled patients could not be infused due to inability to manufacture an adequate dose of CAR T cells 
Novartis submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  to the FDA in October for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion  The applicationwas filed for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory  r r  diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL  who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant  ASCT  
Again in November  the company submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency  EMA  for Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT and for children as well as young adults with r r B cell ALL 
Of late  Gilead   NASDAQ GILD   also received FDA approval for Yescarta   a CAR T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy  Yescarta is the first CAR T therapy approved by the FDA for this indication 
Another company  bluebird bio  Inc  s   NASDAQ BLUE   anti BCMA CAR T therapy  bb21217  is being evaluated for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma  bb21217 as well as bb2121 are being developed in collaboration with Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   Novartis AG Price

Intercept s stock has declined 43 7  year to date against the  s loss of 1 4    In particular  shares have plunged significantly over the last few days due to safety issues regarding the approved drug Ocaliva 
 Quarter in DetailRevenues from international markets were  4 7 million  In third quarter 2017 Ocaliva recorded  40 9 million of sales  up from 30 4 million recorded in second quarter 2017  Ocaliva was approved in the United States  in combination with ursodeoxycholic  UDCA  for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in adults who are unable to endure UDCA in 2016  The drug was also granted conditional approval by the European Commission Sales from the United States markets came in at  36 2 million  up from  27 9 million recorded in the second quarter as prescriptions continue to grow Research and development expenses increased 29 8  year over year to  45 9 million primarily driven by increases in clinical development programs for OCA and infrastructure to support such programs Selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  61 4 million  up from  52 8 million in the year ago quarter driven by personnel related costs to support commercial and international initiatives and an increase in indirect expenses 2017 Outlook ReiteratedIntercept expects operating expenses to be in the middle of the earlier projected range of  380  420 million in 2017  The company believes that continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets   In order to streamline operating expenses  Intercept has decided to deprioritize its INT 767 development program Pipeline UpdateOcaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and primary sclerosing cholangitis  PSC  The FDA has earlier approved a redesign of the phase III trial  REGENERATE on Ocaliva for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis  The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint  either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared with the earlier target of achieving both  The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm  The company completed enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial  data readout in the first half of 2019  The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017  Intercept announced trial results from two phase II trials   CONTROL  Combination OCA aNdsTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids  and AESOP for PSC  CONTROL study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of Ocaliva in combination with statin therapy on lipid metabolism in patients with NASH   Results from AESOP revealed that OCA met the primary endpoint of statistically significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase  ALP  while results from CONTROL showed that the company achieved its objective in demonstrating that the lowest available dose of atorvastatin rapidly reverses OCA associated LDL changes to below baseline levels in NASH patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis Our TakeIntercept s third quarter results were encouraging as the company reported a narrower than expected loss and beat on revenues   However  prescription demand softened following the Dear Health Care Provider letter and the FDA safety communication on Ocaliva Recently  some deaths have been reported in PBC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment  Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis   The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva and stated that the drug may also affect the liver  However  Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva  which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose  The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA  The company concluded that deaths occurred due to overdosing  Consequently  Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider letter  Thereafter  the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing  Intercept is also working with the FDA on further updates to Ocaliva s label for safety purposes Nevertheless  such side effects will limit the sales potential going forward  On the other hand  NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva s prospects   However  bigwigs like Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   and Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that can be used to treat PBC  NASH and the other liver diseases

In a note to clients  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  downgraded the biotech firm from  Equal weight  to  Underweight  and reiterated its price target of  105 00 per share  That call would represent a 23 5  drop from Friday s close 
Morgan Stanley s Matt Harrison said that he expects shares to underperform  citing headwinds in Bluebird s sickle cell business  Still  the analyst noted that Bluebird s BCMA targeting CAR T candidate does provide some valuation support

Bluebird currently has several active clinical and pre clinical programs under its CAR T umbrella  The company s lead CAR T program  bb2121  is a collaboration with biotech giant Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   and has produced encouraging data thus far in its Phase 1 study 
It s been a busy year for the CAR T industry  as several major milestones have been reached  In August  Novartis   NYSE NVS   received approval for its innovative new lymphoblastic leukemia treatment  making it the first approved CAR T therapy in the world 
And earlier that same week  biotech behemoth Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   announced that it was acquiring Kite Pharma   NASDAQ KITE    another competitor in the CAR T market  Gilead will pay a staggering  11 9 billion for Kite  which is expected to receive approval for its own CAR T therapy in November

Continued      
                                                                                                      

A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have been poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline 
The prospects for cures are almost unimaginable  So are the potential profits for early investors 
Zacks just released a Special Report that shows how to take advantage of this trend with 5 stocks to buy now  Deadline to download  Midnight Sunday  October 8 

                                                                                                      
Teaching Your Body to Fight Its Own Cancer
The first big breakthrough of the 21st century is called  immuno oncology  where researchers are learning to teach a person s own immune system to fight his or her cancer 
That s the nefarious thing about cancer  It tricks your body s immune system into not recognizing it  But scientists in university labs and at biotechnology companies big and small have been hard at work on cracking the chemical codes of communication between human T cells  the body s disease warriors  and cancer cells 
One of these  immuno therapies  is called CAR T  a technology which uses chimeric antigen receptors to activate T cells  And one company I ve followed for a while in this space  where we just locked in 70  gains in my Healthcare Innovators portfolio  is Juno Therapeutics  JUNO   Here s how they describe their science   
Juno is focused on revolutionizing medicine by re engaging the body s immune system to treat cancer  Founded on the vision that the use of human T cells as therapeutics will drive one of the next important phases in medicine  we are developing cell based cancer immunotherapies based on our chimeric antigen receptor  CAR  and high affinity T cell receptor  TCR  technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells  We have shown compelling evidence of tumor shrinkage in clinical trials using multiple cell based product candidates to address refractory B cell lymphomas and leukemias  Longer term  Juno aims to develop our cell based platform to include additional product candidates to address a broad range of cancers and human diseases 
Why is this such a huge discovery  The answer is probably obvious if you or anyone you know has had cancer and gone through surgery  radiation treatment  or chemotherapy  Those  cures  are painful  risky  and don t always work 
To genetically engineer a patient s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer is a revolutionary and most welcome breakthrough in oncology treatment 
While this science is still in its early stages  the clinical results have been inspiring and gaining FDA  fast track  designation to speed the R D process  And speaking of inspired  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  is so excited about this frontier that they just plunked down  12 billion for a leading player  Kite Pharma  KITE  
I was also inspired this spring to buy more of these companies  besides JUNO  for my new Healthcare Innovators portfolio 
But the next frontier is one I am equally excited about  yet just beginning to explore for its investment potential as the R D  proof of concept  is still not conclusive for humans 
Gene Editing  Entering the Realm of Fantastic Possibilities
Some people are against genetically modified food  or experiments that alter animal species  But more of us should take an interest in the possibilities of altering human genetic destiny 
While the war to cure cancer in bold new ways using the body s immune system is welcome by most  a quieter revolution has been applying its scientific secrets in a more controversial way to potentially cure inherited diseases 
The breakthrough is called genome editing  Not only will it pay for you to understand this complex and controversial science  especially as you ll be seeing and hearing more news stories and debate about the latest discoveries and achievements  but it could pay us as investors too 
Because whether everyone agrees or not  this science will move forward and many committed researchers will be hot on the trail of curing or preventing disease at the genetic level 
Billions of dollars have already been invested by large pharmaceutical companies and this trend will only grow because the potential outcomes in terms of cures and healthcare cost savings are very sizable 
Genome editing is already being used to modify human blood cells that are then put back into the body to treat conditions including leukemia and AIDS  It could also potentially be used to treat other infections and simple genetic conditions such as muscular dystrophy and hemophilia 
5 Stocks to Ride the Breakthrough
I ve prepared a Zacks Special Report to help you capitalize on this new frontier of medicine 
It s titled Cures and Riches  5 Stocks for the Life Saving  Fortune Building Promise of Gene Editing and you re invited to 
Of course  it s critically important to not simply invest in companies involved with gene editing but to pick the right ones at the right time  For me  5 companies have the best breakout potential in this fast emerging space 
One has 2 product candidates that were recently granted FDA Fast Track designation  Another is developing a potential game changer for cystic fibrosis in addition to its gene editing initiatives  And 3 other stocks offer comparable excitement to early investors 
Please note that the deadline to download this report is midnight Sunday  October 8

201526,423042,GILD,Should Value Investors Consider Gilead Sciences  GILD  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Gilead Sciences has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Gilead Sciences  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 6 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands significantly lower than the highs for the stock  indicating that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should point out that Gilead Sciences has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 4  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Gilead Sciences has a P S ratio of about 3 8  This is a bit higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  This indicates that the stock is a bit overvalued from this aspect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Gilead Sciences currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Gilead Sciences a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for Gilead Sciences is just 6 5  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 23 5  Clearly  GILD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Gilead Sciences might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives GILD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Notably  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter and full year have seen three and five estimates go higher in the past sixty days  respectively  The company did not witness any downward revisions in the said time frame This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 6 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Gilead Sciences  Inc  Price and Consensus    However  this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nonetheless  the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock s prospects in the near term look good Bottom LineGilead Sciences is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  this Zacks Rank  3 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among Top 35  of more than 250 industries   However  the industry has underperformed the broader market over the past two years  This is visible from the chart below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader industry factors to turn favorable  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace  the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity  But which stocks should you buy  Zacks just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to Locking Down Profits to help answer this question This new Special Report gives you the information you need to make well informed investment choices in this space  More importantly  it also highlights 4 cybersecurity picks with strong profit potential ,2017-09-18,Zacks Investment

201527,423043,GILD,Gilead s  GILD  Epclusa Receives Label Expansion In Canada,opinion,"Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced that Health Canada has granted a Notice of Compliance  NOC  for updated label of hepatitis C virus drug  Epclusa 
The drug s label has been expanded to extend the drug s use for patients co infected with HIV 1 
The drug was approved in Canada in July 2016 for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis  or with decompensated cirrhosis in combination with ribavirin 
We expect the drug s sales to increase with this label expansion as HCV co infection remains a major cause of morbidity in HIV infected individuals 
Last month  Health Canada granted a NOC for single tablet regimen  Vosevi  sofosbuvir 400 mg velpatasvir 100 mg voxilaprevir 100 mg   for chronic HCV infection 
Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market  courtesy of its blockbuster HCV drugs  Sovaldi and Harvoni  The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the United States  June 2016  and EU  July 2016  and became the first and only all oral  pan genotypic  STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir  an NS5A inhibitor   for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 6 chronic HCV infection  The approval of Vosevi is expected to boost Gilead s strong HCV portfolio further 
However  the HCV franchise is under pressure due to competition and pricing issues  We note that Harvoni  Sovaldi and Epclusa  face competition from AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others  Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck   Co   Inc  s   NYSE MRK   Zepatier 

 
Gilead s stock has gained 17 5  year to date against the  17 3  
Gilead recently announced plans to acquire Kite Pharma  Inc    NASDAQ KITE   to foray in the emerging field of cell therapy  Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor  CAR  or an engineered T cell receptor  TCR   depending on the type of cancer  The acquisition will diversify Gilead s portfolio and poise the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space  We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative HCV market due to competitive pressure

201539,423055,GILD,6 ETF Picks For September,opinion,"As we exited a lukewarm August and stepped into the final month of Q3  the investing cohort must have shifted its focus to the likely market movement in September  This is especially true given the month s cursed seasonality in the equity market 
September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks  According to   a consensus carried out from 1950 to 2016 has revealed that September ended up offering positive returns in 29 years and negative returns in 38 years  with an average return of negative 0 67   which is worse than any month 
Undesirable financial events like the start of the Great Depression in  or the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008 all crept up in the month of September  Even this September bears the risk of considerable negative changes to the market in case geopolitical tensions between North Korea and the U S  heighten  and political uncertainty in the United States related to tax reforms and government shutdown escalates 
All these make it more important to pin point ETFs that could safeguard investors from any steep and sudden market swing as well as lead them to some gains 
PowerShares QQQ 
September may be ill reputed in terms of stock returns  but this time the month opened up with a deluge of upbeat data points  First  at the end of August  the Commerce Department released Q2 economic growth data of 3  compared with its earlier estimate of 2 6   This was the best GDP growth since first quarter 2015  read    
And at the start of September  data showed that U S  manufacturing expanded in August at the quickest clip   This calls for growth investing  We are thus bullish on Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ  Nasdaq Composite has already registered the largest  of the year on signs of economic strength and a bounce in biotech shares 
SPDR S P Biotech  MX XBI  ETF 
Biotech ETFs  especially those with a focus on cancer therapy  staged a great show in August in particular on Gilead s   NASDAQ GILD   buyout announcement of clinical stage biopharmaceutical company Kite Pharma   NASDAQ KITE     Plus  a CAR T treatment     has been approved for use in the United States lately  All these developments in the biotech sphere should bode well for the related ETFs  read    
VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF 
The usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin  Ethereum and Ripple are on a tear  Following its immense price rise   has also jumped into this area with the launch of its own virtual coin called  WhopperCoin  in Russia  read    
Since mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors  this part of the technology sector should perform well in September  In any case  semiconductor is the value centric traditional tech area that is likely to have an upper hand in an edgy investing environment  Moreover  the semiconductor space is  rapidly with a number of deals announced lately 
iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Global ETF 
Since U S  equities have a record of underperformance in the month  investors can have a look at the global ETF  This way  investors can mitigate certain risks  Notably  the global economy is on an upward trajectory  And the fund looks to track the global developed and emerging market large  and mid cap stocks chosen on the basis of value  quality  momentum  and low size scores  read    
WisdomTree Europe Small Cap Dividend ETF  
The Euro zone economic growth has looked up this year  The region grew  sequentially in Q2 following 0 5  expansion in the previous period  Despite this positive sentiment  a rising euro might be a deterrent  So  we have chosen a small cap Europe ETF   DFE   which is less susceptible to a rising euro 
Small caps better reflect the uptick in the domestic economy  And with the benchmark U S  Treasury yield loitering under 2 2   it would be intriguing to go for a higher yielding pick  The fund yields about 2 66  annually 
iShares S P Moderate Allocation Fund 
Finally  we would like to pick a full fledged defensive ETF like AOM  The fund takes a fund of funds approach and is a combination of bonds and global stocks  Equities make up about 45  of the fund followed by 26  government or Treasury bonds  The U S  accounts for about 62  of the portfolio while Japan  5 7   and the U K   4   take the next two spots

201540,423056,GILD,Kymriah  First CAR T Therapy Approved  4 Pharma Stocks In Focus,opinion,"Of late  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are investing in immuno oncology research therapies as it remains a key area of focus  thanks to its vast growth potential  Last week  the immuno oncology space grabbed investors  attention with the FDA approving Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   breakthrough gene transfer treatment  Kymriah  tisagenlecleucel  suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  that is refractory or in second or later relapse 
Kymriah  formerly CTL019  is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell  CAR T  therapy approved  A novel immunocellular therapy and one time treatment  Kymriah uses patient s T cells to fight cancer 
While the long term impact of the treatment is yet to be evaluated  the approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer  To start with  CAR T uses patient s cells to identify and destroy cancer cells  thereby making it different from other small molecule or biologic therapies  During the treatment  T cells are drawn from a patient s blood  These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen 
With the approval of Kymriah  investors have started to shift their focus on a number of companies which have been developing their pipeline candidates to remain afloat in the highly competitive environment 
4 Stocks That Warrant a Look

201557,423073,GILD,Why Novatis   475K CAR T Cancer Treatment Is Actually Cheap,opinion,"The cancer treatment industry is celebrating a massive victory on Wednesday  as Novartis   NYSE NVS   received approval for its innovative new lymphoblastic leukemia treatment  making it the first approved CAR T therapy in the world 
After achieving unprecedented results in patients with this deadly form of cancer  Novartis  new therapy  which will be marketed as  Kymriah   was officially approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration today 
Kymriah is an example of a CAR T therapy  CAR T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient s immune T cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells 
Unlike traditional medicines and treatments  each CAR T therapy must be individually tailored to a specific patient  For this reason  patients seeking Kymriah will have to travel to one of just 32 locations around the country that can administer the therapy  From there  the harvested cells are sent to a Novartis facility in New Jersey  where they are edited and then sent back 
And the logistics aren t the only thing that s challenging for patients looking to receive Kymriah  Indeed  Novartis has said that just one course of treatment will cost a staggering  475 000 
Nevertheless  the prevailing reaction from the market is that this price tag is actually quite cheap  all things considered  Kymriah left about 83  of trial participants with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer free after just three months 
On top of its effectiveness  Kymriah s initial cost is also quite a bit lower than analysts were expecting  In fact  Wall Street estimates for the therapy s opening price reached as high as  750 000 for just one dose 
For Novartis  this means that Kymriah won t be a massive revenue generator  There are only about 3 100 new cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia each year  and most of these can be treated with traditional drugs  Nevertheless  this is a monumental achievement for the company 
And while Novartis is the first company in the world to receive regulatory approval for a CAR T treatment  it is hardly the only brand developing these cures  Earlier this week  we learned that biotech behemoth Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   was planning to acquire CAR T developer Kite Pharma   NASDAQ KITE   for a staggering  11 9 billion  also read    
Kite s lead CAR T candidate  axicabtagene ciloleucel  is currently under review by the FDA  Axicabtagene ciloleucel is expected to be approved as a treatment for aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma  with a decision coming on or before November 29 
Elsewhere in the biotech space  companies like Juno Therapeutics   NASDAQ JUNO   and Bluebird Bio   NASDAQ BLUE   are working to develop CAR T therapies  Both of these researchers watched their stock prices skyrocket in response to the Kite buyout  as investors speculated that they could also become takeover targets soon 
Kymriah s approval marks the beginning of what could become a monumental moment for biotech investors  but more importantly  it is the first in what will hopefully be a long list of world changing cancer treatments

201558,423074,GILD,iFOREX Daily Analysis   August 30  2017,opinion,"On Tuesday the U S  Dollar fell to a new low since January 2015 against major global currencies  following increased geopolitical fears  after North Korea fired a missile over Japan on Monday 
Gold prices gave away some of the gains from Monday after reaching a new high year to date with high volatility in the precious metal amid fears of further escalations on the North Korean peninsula 
Oil traded again lower due to hurricane Harvey pushing demand down for crude oil as a significant amount of oil refinery capacity is impacted by the storm 
U S  equities traded up on Tuesday after positive consumer confidence data and support by resilient technology stocks 
Bitcoin rallied on Tuesday and was finally able to climb over the  4 500 level  Other cryptocurrencies had a calmer day with the Litecoin USD again slightly higher and having its fifth day in a row with a gain  Ripple USD was slightly down from its final level on Tuesday

201559,423075,GILD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Gilead Sciences  Kite Pharma  AbbVie s And Novartis AG,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 30  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Gilead Sciences  Inc  NASDAQ   NASDAQ GILD       Kite Pharma  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ KITE       AbbVie s  NYSE   NYSE ABBV      and Novartis AG  NYSE   NYSE NVS       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Gilead to Fly High with Kite Pharma AcquisitionBiotech giant Gilead Sciences  Inc   NASDAQ      announced that it will buy Kite Pharma  Inc   NASDAQ      to foray into the emerging field of cell therapy Terms of the Agreement As per the agreement  Gilead will pay  180 00 per share in cash at a transaction valued at approximately  11 9 billion  The price represents a 28  premium over the closing share price of Kite as of Aug 25  2017 The transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2017  The acquisition is expected to be neutral to the bottom line by the third year and accretive thereafter Strategic BenefitWe note that Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor  CAR  or an engineered T cell receptor  TCR   depending on the type of cancer  The most advanced therapy candidate in Kite s pipeline is axicabtagene ciloleucel  axi cel  which is being developed for the treatment of refractory aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma  which includes diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL   transformed follicular lymphoma  TFL  and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma  PMBCL   The Biologics License Application  BLA  for the candidate was submitted in Mar 2017 This CAR T therapy is currently under priority review in the United States and the FDA is expected to give a decision on Nov 29  2017  The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in 2018  While Kite is prepared for a commercial launch in the United States as manufacturing preparation are complete  the company is currently building infrastructure in Europe  We remind investors that another pipeline candidate in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors is KITE 585  a CAR T therapy candidate that targets BCMA expressed in multiple myeloma Our TakeThe acquisition will diversify Gilead s portfolio and position the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative hepatitis C  HCV  market due to competitive pressure  Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs  Sovaldi and Harvoni  However  the HCV franchise is under pressure because of competition and pricing issues We note that Harvoni  Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie s  NYSE      Viekira Pak and Viekira XR  among others  Moreover  Gilead was sitting on  21 1 billion of cash and short term marketable securities  Hence  an acquisition announcement was lurking CAR T is manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies  During the treatment process  T cells are drawn from a patient s blood  These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create T cells that are genetically coded to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other Bcells expressing a specific antigen While the deal might look expensive given the premium Gilead paid for Kite  the CAR T space is expected to be revolutionary in treatments for cancer   The CAR T space represents immense potential at this juncture and a potential approval of axi cell will be a significant boost for Gilead s prospects which has dampened of late Gilead s stock has declined 4 3  in the year so far  against the 9 3  Apart from Kite  Novartis AG  NYSE      is another company that is focussed on CAR T treatments   In July  the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  ODAC  unanimously recommended the approval of immunocellular therapy candidate CTL019  tisagenlecleucel  and a decision is expected shortly  September October  CTL019 could become the first CAR T cell therapy if approved  CTL019  an investigational CAR T therapy  is being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory  r r  pediatric and young adult patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL   A potential approval will also open new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r r B cell ALL On the other hand  shares of Kite were up 28  on the news as the company will immensely benefit from Gilead s dominant position in the biotech space upon an anticipated approval for its lead candidate  In fact  this year so far  Kite Pharma s stock is up 297 1   which compares favorably with a 9 3  increase registered by the  Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Zacks

Kite Pharma                                  Kite Pharma s CAR T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel for treating aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma  NHL  is under priority review in the U S  A decision from the FDA is expected on Nov 29  We believe the solid efficacy profile demonstrated by the pivotal ZUMA 1 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel is likely to support the drug s approval this year  In Europe  a regulatory application was filed in July 2017 with an approval and launch expected next year According to the company  the initial market opportunity for axicabtagene ciloleucel includes about 7 400 and 7 000 addressable CAR T patients in the U S  and Europe  respectively  while 7 800 new cases are diagnosed in Japan every year and 25 000 in key urban eastern rural coastal areas of China Meanwhile  other studies with axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional candidates including KITE 585 and KITE 718 are also advancing The acquisition should diversify Gilead s portfolio beyond the struggling HCV franchise and position it to take share in the growing cellular therapy space  The HCV franchise is under pressure because of competition and pricing issues Other CAR T Therapy Makers

developing JCAR017 in partnership with Celgene for NHL  utilizing the CAR T cell technology  Data presented in June demonstrated a 50  complete response in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive cd19  NHL  The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019  In fact  shares of Juno are up almost 43  after the Kite Gilead deal was announced on buyout speculation  The company s shares are up 132 4  year to date Bluebird is developing anti BCMA CAR T cell therapy  bb2121  also in collaboration with Celgene  The candidate is only in phase I studies  However  data from an early stage refractory multiple myeloma study on bb2121 presented in June showed that 100  of the 15 evaluable patients in active dose cohorts achieved an objective response  Overall response rate  ORR  across all cohorts  n 18  was 89   The investment community believes that the data  though early stage  bode well for the candidate

Gold further declined slightly after hitting an 11 month high on Tuesday  Oil was further down on Wednesday as EIA inventory figures showed higher than expected inventories of petrol and oil distillates  Combined with uncertainty when refineries in the storm affected south of the U S  would start operating again this led to fears that oil demand will stay down for some time 
Bitcoin USD fell on Wednesday after breaking the  4 500 level upwards and hitting new highs on Tuesday  while still holding prices over  4 500  Etherum continued its rally being now up almost by 20  in the last seven days and is coming close to its all time high from June this year

Gold
Gold extended its losses on Wednesday after an 11 month high on Tuesday  as the U S  dollar significantly reduced its losses from earlier this week as better U S  job and employment growth data reduced the demand for the safe haven commodity 
This economic data led in the eyes of market participant to an increased probability in a rate hike from the U S  Federal Reserve later this year 
U S  employment and inflation data published early in the North American trading session could give further insight in the state of the U S  economy and thus impact the demand for Gold

201576,423092,GILD,Biotech ETFs Soar On Gilead Kite Deal ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   showered gains on the biotech ETF world on August 28 by announcing the buyout news of Kite Pharma   NASDAQ KITE   for  11 9 billion  GILD shares gained over 1 2  while KITE shares surged about 28  on the day  responding to the super deal 
Kite Pharma is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  focused on the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy products  The company is developing a pipeline of eACT based product candidates for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies 
The deal marks Gilead Sciences  biggest deal for a new cancer treatment that will help the company to look away from its receding sales of medicines for  infections and focus on some budding zones  Gilead said it will be a  180 per share all cash deal 
With this  Gilead will step into the new arena of oncology treatment   known as CAR T   which targets the body s own immune system to fight tumors  As per the source  Kite  doesn t have a treatment on the market yet  is awaiting U S  approval for a drug for non Hodgkin lymphoma  a type of blood cancer  
Since Gilead is yet to see prodigious success itself in cancer research  it had to go for an inorganic expansion to establish its presence in this apparently most wanted area  Needless to say  this megadeal acted as a cornerstone for the entire biotech space  read    
Inside the Participant Stocks  
Gilead has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  with VGM  Value Growth Momentum  score of C  On the other hand  Kite Pharma has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  with a VGM score of F  at the time of writing 
In this situation  targeting a basket or ETF approach would be more intriguing than single stock pick plays  First  through ETF ways  investors get to play the overall evolvement of the biotech space and certain downbeat VGM scores of GILD and KITE would not come in the way of investors  optimism 
After all  immune oncology is expected to rule the next era biotech trading  Like yesterday  biotech stocks saw some great trading about two months ago  when Clovis Oncology   NASDAQ CLVS   shares gained about 46 5  following the company s positive cancer drug data  read    
ETF Impact 
Kite Pharma has weights in the range of 4 5  to 6  in funds like ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF   SI SBIO    ARK Genomic Revolution Multi Sector ETF   Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF  and PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology and Genome   The funds gained about 3 8   5 3   6 2  and 2 5   respectively  on August 28  2017  Biotech ETFs like ARKG  Bioshares Biotech Clinical Trial   HM BBC    up 4 0   also hit a 52 week high  see  here  
Investors should note that Gilead Sciences has a considerable focus  in the range of 8  to 10   on VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF   LON BBH   and iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF   which obviously got a spike from the said acquisition news  BBH and IBB were up 1  and 1 9   respectively  on August 28

This CAR T therapy is currently under priority review in the United States and the FDA is expected to give a decision on Nov 29  2017  The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in 2018  While Kite is prepared for a commercial launch in the United States as manufacturing preparation are complete  the company is currently building infrastructure in Europe  We remind investors that another pipeline candidate in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors is KITE 585  a CAR T therapy candidate that targets BCMA expressed in multiple myeloma 
Our Take
The acquisition will diversify Gilead s portfolio and position the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space 
We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative hepatitis C  HCV  market due to competitive pressure  Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs  Sovaldi and Harvoni  However  the HCV franchise is under pressure because of competition and pricing issues 
We note that Harvoni  Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak and Viekira XR  among others  Moreover  Gilead was sitting on  21 1 billion of cash and short term marketable securities  Hence  an acquisition announcement was lurking 
CAR T is manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies  During the treatment process  T cells are drawn from a patient s blood  These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create T cells that are genetically coded to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other Bcells expressing a specific antigen 
While the deal might look expensive given the premium Gilead paid for Kite  the CAR T space is expected to be revolutionary in treatments for cancer   The CAR T space represents immense potential at this juncture and a potential approval of axi cell will be a significant boost for Gilead s prospects which has dampened of late 
Gilead s stock has declined 4 3  in the year so far  against the 9 3  

Apart from Kite  Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   is another company that is focussed on CAR T treatments   In July  the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  ODAC  unanimously recommended the approval of immunocellular therapy candidate CTL019  tisagenlecleucel  and a decision is expected shortly  September October  
CTL019 could become the first CAR T cell therapy if approved  CTL019  an investigational CAR T therapy  is being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory  r r  pediatric and young adult patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL   A potential approval will also open new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r r B cell ALL 
On the other hand  shares of Kite were up 28  on the news as the company will immensely benefit from Gilead s dominant position in the biotech space upon an anticipated approval for its lead candidate  In fact  this year so far  Kite Pharma s stock is up 297 1   which compares favorably with a 9 3  increase registered by the

201595,423111,GILD,Will Endo  ENDP  Continue To Disappoint Investors In 2017 ,opinion,"We issued an updated report on Endo International plc   NASDAQ ENDP   on Aug 24 
Endo  a global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on branded and generic pharmaceuticals  was formed following the acquisition of Paladin Labs 
Revenues from the Generics base business is under significant pressure due to intensifying consortium pricing pressures and additional competitive entrants and product discontinuations as well as discrete factors  including destocking and shifts in purchase timing due to market conditions  Revenues from the segment is projected to decline in the high single to low double digit percentage range in 2017 due to base business sales decline  partially offset by revenues growth in sterile injectables and new launch in alternative dosages which will be partially offset by growth in its sterile injectables and new launch revenues respectively 
Endo s Branded segment continues to be under pressure due to additional competitive entrants as well as a continuous rise in the number of public policy and regulatory actions including the recent CDC guidelines related to opioid prescribing and use and divestiture of Strenda 
In a major setback  Endo withdrew opioid pain medication Opana ER  oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release  from the market following FDA s request in June  In March 2017  the FDA Drug Safety Risk Management and Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committees voted in the ratio of 18 to 8 and consented that reformulated Opana ER did not outweigh public health risks 
A few members stated that the benefits are now overshadowed by the continuing public health concerns around the product s misuse  abuse and diversion  In June  the FDA directed the company to remove the drug from the market  The move comes in wake of the widespread opioid abuse epidemic  The drug represented 4  of total 2016 revenues 
International revenues in 2017 is expected to decline in the mid to low 20  range  reflecting the divestiture of Litha and Somar 

Meanwhile  Endo stock has declined 46 7  in the year so far compared to the  s gain of 2 2  during the same period 
The company lowered is revenue guidance range by  70 million and now expects revenues in the range to be  3 38 billion to  3 53 billion  The guidance was lowered due to withdrawal of Opana ER and discontinuation of products associated with recently announced manufacturing restructuring

The company reported adjusted earnings of  1 85 per share in the reported quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 73  Earnings were however down from the year ago figure of  2 03 due to continued pricing pressure within the Specialty Generics 
Net sales in the quarter came in at  824 5 million  down 4 9  year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  827 3 million 

Mallinckrodt s stock price has declined 17 9  in the year so far  compared with the  fall of 14  
Quarter in Detail
The company reports results under two segments   Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics 
Sales at the Specialty Brands segment were  594 5 million  up 0 9  from the year ago quarter  Acthar  Mallinckrodt s largest product  garnered sales of  319 4 million  up 7 1   Inomax  its second largest product  generated sales of  125 5 million  up 3 6   Ofirmev sales grew 7 1  year over year to  75 7 million 
Sales of the Therakos immunology platform were  51 2 million  down 2 5   Although the kit supply issue was resolved in the first quarter  the company underestimated the complexity of the conversion from the XTS to Cellex devices  resulting in lower than anticipated net sales  Moreover  these transitional issues are expected to persist in the upcoming quarters 
As expected  weakness in the Specialty Generics segment continues  The segment recorded sales of  216 million  down 18  but better than management s expectation due to the active pharmaceutical ingredients products and controlled substances and other products categories 
Adjusted selling  general and administrative expenses in the reported quarter increased 3 2  to  232 1 million  Meanwhile  research and development expenses declined 7 5  to  69 2 million 
During the second quarter  the company repurchased 2 4 million ordinary shares for  100 7 million under its share repurchase programs  bringing the total repurchased in the first half to 8 million

 Mallinckrodt PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Our Take
Mallinckrodt s second quarter results were mixed as the company beat on earnings but missed on sales as weaknesses in the generics segment persist  While Acthar sales continue to be strong on the back of increased formulary positions and access for appropriate patients in both the commercial and public environments  sales of Therakos is expected to decline 
The company is currently streamlining its business  The company aims to focus better on its specialty pharmaceutical business after having sold its Nuclear Imaging business  The company also sold its Intrathecal Therapy business  On the other hand  the acquisition of hemostasis drugs   Recothrom Thrombin topical  recombinant   PreveLeak and Raplixa  fibrin sealant    from The Medicines Co    NASDAQ MDCO   has strengthened its growing hospital portfolio

Non cyclical Investors are defined as investors who will make investment decisions without conducting enough research into investments  They will invest in ventures that show signs of the least amount of risk  Cyclical Investors are defined as investors who conduct thorough research into an investment  This research allows them to choose companies that offer a small amount of risk  If a company is fitting to the Non cyclical Investor  it is also acceptable for Cyclical Investors 
Navient Corp  NASDAQ NAVI 
This corporation is suitable for the Cyclical Investor  The Non cyclical Investor will be focused on the deficient earnings the company posted for the decade  The shrinking return history also caught his attention  The Cyclical Investor has no initial concerns  This makes him feel comfortable  and he proceeds with the research 
The corporation is undervalued after posting growth in its earnings which rose from 63 cents in 2012 to an astonishing  2 39 for 2016  This level of growth is ahead of the expected rate of 1 25  annual loss over the next decade  As a result  the ModernGraham model  shows estimates of inherent value above the price  During the assessment period  research into the company showed that it was trading below its Graham Number of  21 98  The company pays out dividends of 64 cents per share for a yield of 4 5   This makes it one of the best dividend paying stocks in the current market 
Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD  
Gilead Sciences is not an acceptable choice for the Non cyclical Investor because he will be put off by the faint current ratio  poor dividend history  and the inflated price book  P B  ratio  The only thing that the Cyclical Investor will concern himself with is the size of debt relative to the value of current assets  These factors seem positive for the Cyclical Investor  and he should feel contented to continue with analysis  The company appears to satisfy characteristics of an undervalued company  This is because of its growing EPSmg that went from  1 61 in 2012 to  8 69 in 2016  The valuation model the returns at an estimate of natural value above the price 
Michael Kors Holdings  NYSE KORS

Linamar Corporation  TO LNR 
Linamar is an acceptable choice for the Cyclical Investor  This is because reason behind this is the Non cyclical Investor will only concentrate on the moderate current ratio and inadequate earnings posted over the last decade  The Cyclical Investor will choose to focus on the level of debt relative to the net value of current assets  From this approach all Cyclical Investors should be satisfied with progressing with their analysis  The company appears to be undervalued after posting positive figures in its EPSmg which rose from  2 22 in 2013 to  6 93 for 2017  The level of earnings growth demonstrated is better than the market s implied estimate  The valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the price 
LyondellBasell Industries NV  NYSE LYB

201629,423145,GILD,Regeneron  REGN  Beats On Q2 Earnings   Sales  Raises View,opinion,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   reported second quarter of 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales beat expectations on the back of strong performance of eye care drug Eylea 

Regeneron s stock has gained 29 9  year to date outperforming the  s 9 9  rally  Shares are up in pre market trading and we expect shares to gain further momentum 
The company reported earnings  including the impact of share based compensation expenses and tax adjustments  of  3 88 per share in the second quarter beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 67 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Excluding share based compensation expenses  Regeneron s earnings came in at  4 17 per share  up from  2 82 reported in the year ago quarter 
Total revenue in the second quarter increased 21 2  year over year to  1 47 billion driven by strong sales of eye treatment drug  Eylea  Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 36 billion 
We note Regeneron has co developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY    The company is solely responsible for the U S  sales of the eye drug and is entitled to profits  However  it shares profits and losses equally with Bayer from ex U S  Eylea sales  except in Japan  where the company receives a royalty on net sales 
Quarterly Highlights
Net product sales increased to  924 1 million in the reported quarter  up 10 8  year over year  The majority of sales came from Eylea in the U S    919 million  up 10 6    Sales of Eylea in ex U S  markets were  542 million  up from  486 million reported in the year ago quarter 
Revenues also include Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and Bayer collaboration revenues of  432 million  compared with  355 million in the year ago quarter  Collaboration revenues from Sanofi were  222 1 million in the quarter  compared with  163 4 million a year ago  Praluent recorded global net sales of  46 million in the reported quarter  up from  24 in the year ago quarter   We note Praluent has been co developed in collaboration with Sanofi  Product sales for Praluent are recorded by Sanofi  while
Regeneron shares profits or losses from the commercialization of the drug 
Dupixent sales came in at  29 million  The drug was approved earlier in 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD  
R D expenses decreased 8 9  while selling  general and administrative  SG A  increased 5 1  during the quarter 
2017 Outlook Updated
Based on a strong first half  the company raised its sales guidance for Eylea   In 2017  Regeneron expects U S  Eylea net sales to grow around 10   earlier guidance  growth in single digits   The company now expects adjusted unreimbursed
R D expenses in the range of  925  965 million  down from the earlier guidance of  950  1 025 million 
We note that the European Medicine Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  rendered a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Dupixent  recommending its approval for use in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy in Jul 2017  Meanwhile  a phase III study of Dupixent in pediatric patients  6 11 years of age  with uncontrolled persistent asthma was initiated in second quarter 2017 
In May 2017  the FDA approved Kevzara for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs  DMARDs   The drug was also approved in Europe in Jun 2017 
In Jun 2017  the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Kevzara in combination with methotrexate  MTX  for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to  or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs  Kevzara may be used as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate 
Our Take
Regeneron s second quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates driven by strong Eylea sales  The increase in guidance was also encouraging  Dupixent launch in the U S  for moderate to severe atopic dermatitisis progressing well and a potential approval in the EU in the second half of 2017 will further boost sales  Moreover  the company is also looking to expand Dupixent s label in uncontrolled asthma

201630,423146,GILD,Infinity  INFI  Q2 Loss Wider Than Expected  View Intact,opinion,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INFI   reported a loss of 34 cents per share in second quarter 2017  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 22 cents  The company had reported a loss of 12 cents in the year ago quarter Infinity Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Since Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio  the company earns revenues in the form of royalties  license and milestone payments as well as research and development  R D  support fees paid by its partners 
Infinity did not record any revenues during second quarter 2017  However  it recorded collaboration revenues of  9 5 million in the year ago quarter  related to Infinity s previous collaboration agreement with AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   
Infinity s share price has increased 0 7  year to date compared with the  s gain of 1 0  

Quarter in Detail
In the reported quarter  R D expenses plummeted to  3 9 million from  52 9 million  The decline was mainly related to a decrease in clinical development expenses for duvelisib in addition to the company s 2016 restructuring activities 
General and administrative  G A  expenses were  6 2 million for the reported quarter  down from  15 7 million in the year ago quarter  The decrease was mainly due to the company s 2016 restructuring activities 
2017 Outlook Reiterated
Infinity expects net loss to be in the range of  40  50 million in 2017  The company anticipates ending 2017 with year end cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities balance in the  40  50 million band  Moreover  Infinity expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30  2017  should be adequate to fund the company s capital needs into the first quarter 2019 
Pipeline Update
Currently  Infinity is evaluating IPI 549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb Company s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo  nivolumab  in a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors 
The company completed an evaluation of escalating monotherapy doses of IPI 549 ranging from 10   60 mg QD once daily and has determined the 60 mg dose for evaluation in the expansion component of the study  The selection of the mentioned dose was based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic analyses  which showed that IPI 549 maintained full suppression of PI3K gamma at this dose level 
Further  data from the study also showed that the IPI 549 dosed at 60 mg QD was well tolerated  and no dose limiting toxicities were observed  Subsequently  the monotherapy expansion component of the study is now available for enrolment  The study will evaluate the safety and activity of IPI 549 dosed at 60 QD in approximately 25 patients 
Meanwhile  dose escalation evaluating IPI 549 in combination with Opdivo is currently ongoing  The company plans to initiate the combination expansion component of the study in the second half of 2017 
On the other hand  the company amended its license agreement with Takeda Oncology in Jul 2017 for IPI 549  Per the amended agreement  the company will no longer have an obligation to pay Takeda future royalties on worldwide net sales of selective inhibitors of PI3K gamma  including IPI 549  In lieu  Infinity issued unsecured convertible notes of  6 0 million to Takeda that mature in 2018 and accrues interest at an annual rate of 8  
Our Take
The wider than expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing  Infinity received a huge setback when AbbVie terminated their collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of duvelisib  Hence  we expect investor focus on pipeline progress in the upcoming quarters

201642,423158,GILD,Biotech Bull Is Back  4 Keys To Play It,opinion,"Since the biotechnology bubble burst in 2015  resulting in a 40  bear market  something has been building that I ve been waiting several quarters for    a resumption of the great  long term bull market 
This week  the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ETF  IBB  surmounted a closing level that takes back half of its losses  I think we have a lot more room to go  and maybe even new highs eventually 
But the rules are different this time in this second big wave of the bio bull  You can t simply ride the next hot tip or momentum play  Your research and stock selection must have certain discipline  or else you ll get burned 
Here I share 4 keys in my research process and why they are so important 
1  Investment Bank Research
I read dozens of research reports every week from Wall Street s top investment analysts  Now  we all know that these analysts are conflicted from time to time as one side of the company is providing advisory or capital underwriting services for a fee while the  pure research  side is not supposed to be influenced by that business 
But for the most part  there are many good and un conflicted analysts devoted to their research  Many are PhDs in the life sciences or even have medical degrees and they care about the quality of their analysis  Reading their reports every week gives me an edge on understanding the most complicated investing in the world 
And it s how I decided to pull the trigger on Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  in May as they tackle a unique disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
2  Big Brother Partnerships
How do you build a billion dollar business in medicine  Sometimes it takes a few hundred million dollars in R D  That s where big Pharma companies come in to help emerging ones with drug pipeline clinical trials that keep the FDA happy  The big firms are constantly looking for exciting new R D  often before it even leaves university labs 
When I see a big company    whether from traditional Pharma or Biotech    team up with a little guy  I know something good is in the pipeline and I start paying more attention to that potential breakthrough  If  big brother  helps get my target through Phase 2 clinical trials with positive results  the stock may already be on the launch pad 
Knowing the long term commitment of partner Sanofi  PA SASY  gave me the conviction to buy Regeneron  REGN  at  366 this year 
More      
                                                                                                      

The healthcare industry is on the cusp of a total transformation  Four unstoppable megatrends look to create exciting gains as their impact unfolds in the days ahead  The companies at the forefront of these trends could ultimately save millions of lives AND put big winners in your investment portfolio in the process 
Zacks has just identified what we consider the best ways to profit from this healthcare revolution and you can see them now  You can also access a new special report highlighting a soon to triple niche in the healthcare sector 
Don t delay  this special opportunity ends at midnight Sunday  July 23 

                                                                                                      
3  Medical Journals  Company Presentations  and KOL Circles
There are many great places that new research can be found and company presentations are some of the best  Company scientists know they can t just  pull the wool  over the eyes of Wall Street analysts  When they publish in peer reviewed academic journals or make presentations at industry conferences  there are just as many doctors in the room as number crunchers 
And those presentations often are placed on company websites where I can see the entire slide deck and watch video recordings  This is a great way to not only understand new science but also to be tuned in to the criticism from scientific peers  You can t really understand an R D thesis unless you can also point out its potential flaws 
This brings up a class of expert known as the KOL  or Key Opinion Leader  In BioPharma especially  there are hundreds of doctors and researchers involved at all levels of drug and disease R D whose opinions are widely respected in the global medical community  For doctors at the front lines taking care of their patients  who don t always have time to stay up to date on the latest research  the view of a KOL can often be an important influence in their decision to try a new treatment option 
The payoff here was greater confidence in my thesis to buy Juno Therapeutics  JUNO  in the low  20s on a low risk high reward bet they will be a game changer in the exciting field of immuno oncology 
4  Institutional Buying and Selling
Lastly  I still like to pay attention to what the big money is doing  There are many fund managers running tens of billions in investment war chests that are ear marked solely for the healthcare field  and some are focused entirely on biotech 
Many of these managers are some of the most serious and disciplined of medical sector investors  So  I pay attention to what they are buying and selling and I don t mind following their money trail if enough of my other criteria are in line 
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   GILD  has been a sell for years now  But many have been bottom fishing in the belief that the hepatitis C juggernaut is steps away from finding its next blockbuster acquisition  I thought so too in the mid  60s this year 
Focus on the Long Term Drivers
As I explain often to those who follow my investment research and stock picks  we are pursuing the  megatrends  of healthcare investing  That s why I started a new portfolio this year dedicated to capitalizing on those long term drivers 
This portfolio service  called   gives you something of an inside track as the second wave of the Biotech bull market gets underway 
I have assembled a visionary portfolio of healthcare stocks across various medical sector industries  including 7 more Biotechs besides the four mentioned in this report 
Using the 4 keys of my research process  we are picking powerful assets  brands  and cash flow franchises that will come out on top for strategic healthcare investors 
Now you don t have to dig into medical journals or investment bank reports to pick the most promising healthcare stocks  With Healthcare Innovators  I ll do the research  bring you the most relevant information   in everyday language   and we ll go after exceptional long term gains together 
Plus  if you check out Healthcare Innovators before midnight on Sunday  July 23  you ll get access to a new special report highlighting a flourishing medical niche that is expected to grow from  4 7 billion to  13 1 billion in revenue by 2020

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

5 Drug Stocks Poised to Beat Q2 Earnings Estimates 

	The pharma biotech sector has picked up this year after being battered by the drug pricing controversy in 2016  The first half has been pretty strong for companies in the space 

	The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen almost 9 8  year to date  YTD  after declining almost 10  last year  NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 17 7  YTD after sliding 19 1  in 2016 
	The sector does have its share of challenges in the form of rising competition  high profile pipeline setbacks  slowdown in growth of mature products and the loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs  Though the drug pricing issue still prevails  investors  lately  are hoping that steep pricing will not be as damaging as feared previously 
	Nonetheless  strong performance of newer drugs  evolving pipelines  impressive clinical trial results  new drug approvals  continued strong performance of legacy products and rising demand are some of the factors that promise a sustained recovery in the sector 
	Meanwhile  there have been many more FDA drug approvals so far this year than in 2016  A total of 23 drugs have gained FDA approval YTD  beating the total of 22 for the whole of 2016  With acceleration in the drug approval process  more innovation and a surge in new drug approvals are expected 
	Though M A activities and collaborations deals have slowed down this year  chances are that they will pick up in the second half  With President Trump promising a major tax reform that will allow companies to bring back cash held overseas  acquisition activities are expected to pick up pace  Then again  the number of deals will still be less than the pharma industry  as it has been for many years 
	Finally  the Republican administration s vow to  repeal and replace  Obamacare bodes well for the sector s growth How to Pick Likely Q2 Winners
	Given the enormity of the healthcare space  selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting  But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple  One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive    More often than not  a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation 
	Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their upcoming earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   

	Here are five healthcare stocks that are poised to beat estimates in the second quarter according to our methodology 

	Our first pick is healthcare bellwether Merck   Co   Inc   NYSE           This Kenilworth  NJ  based company has an Earnings ESP of  1 15  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

	Merck is scheduled to report results on Jul 28 
	Our next choice is biotech major  Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ          Carrying a Zacks Rank  3  the stock has an Earnings ESP of  1 86   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is pegged at  1 61 per share  This Summit  NJ based company has a pretty impressive earnings surprise track record  The average earnings surprise over the four trailing quarters is 3 01  
	Celgene is scheduled to announce results on Jul 27 Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ         too has an impressive track record with the company consistently beating earnings expectations  The company s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 52   It looks poised to beat expectations in the second quarter as well  This Foster City  CA  based company carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of  1 45   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 07 per share 
	Gilead is scheduled to report results on Jul 26 Seattle Genetics  Inc   NASDAQ          a biotechnology company is another solid bet  This Zacks Rank  3 stock has an Earnings ESP of  9 30   This Bothell  WA based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8 46  over the trailing four quarters 
	Seattle Genetics is scheduled to release results on Jul 27  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter pegged at a loss of 43 cents per share 
	A small biopharmaceutical company Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ          makes it to our list of likely outperformers in the second quarter by virtue of its Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  30 0  

	The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 20 cents per share  Vanda is expected to report its results on Jul 26 Bottom Line

	Challenges in the form of competitive and pricing pressure will remain in the healthcare sector  However  a number of companies in the space have fared well  Picking some outperformers from the space  backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP  could lead investors to gain this earnings season

201670,423186,GILD,Gilead  GILD  Submits NDA For HIV Combination Therapy Regimen,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced that it has submitted a New Drug Application  NDA  to the FDA for an investigational  once daily single tablet regimen containing bictegravir  50 mg   BIC  and emtricitabine tenofovir alafenamide  200 25 mg   FTC TAF  
The regimen is novel experimental integrase strand transfer inhibitor which is being evaluated for the treatment of HIV 1 infection in adults 
The data from the study showed that BIC FTC TAF has demonstrated high rates of virologic suppression and no treatment emergent resistance through 48 weeks in phase III trials among treatment na ve adult patients and among virologically suppressed adult patients who switched regimens 
The NDA is supported by encouraging data four phase III studies in which the regimen met its primary objective of non inferiority  We note that three of the ongoing studies are designed to explore the efficacy and safety of BIC FTC TAF compared with regimens containing GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   Tivicay  dolutegravir   50mg   DTG  among treatment na ve patients and virologically suppressed patients switching from an existing antiretroviral regimen 
The fourth study is being conducted among virologically suppressed patients and compares switching to BIC FTC TAF versus on a suppressive regimen of two nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor 
Gilead plans to submit a marketing authorization application for the regimen in the European Union in the third quarter of 2017 
Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market  with an impressive portfolio  The newly launched TAF based products Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy are performing well  with strong adoption in both the U S  and EU  Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment na ve and switch patients since its launch in Nov 2015 
Also  Genvoya has been listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines  The TAF based regimens now represent 42  of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy in 2016  Genvoya is now the company s best selling HIV product  surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth quarter 2016 
The uptake in HIV franchise should help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise due to competitive pressure  Competition as well as pricing pressure has intensified further with the launch of Merck s   NYSE MRK   Zepatier 
However  Gilead s HIV products are not only facing generic threats but also steep competition primarily from Tivicay and Triumeq  Meanwhile  Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U S  which should impact sales 

Shares of Gilead underperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the last year with the stock losing 21 7  during this period  compared with the industry s decline of 4 9

201672,423188,GILD,Is Gilead Sciences A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Gilead Sciences has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 13  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 32  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Gilead Sciences  current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number remaining stable over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 32 08  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Gilead Sciences has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 25  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Gilead Sciences has a P S ratio of about 2 94  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  GILD is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Gilead Sciences currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Gilead Sciences a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Gilead Sciences might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives GILD a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen three up and three down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 3 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined almost 2 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Gilead Sciences  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Bottom LineGilead Sciences is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 36  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy   Last year  it was generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early ",2017-06-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-gilead-sciences-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200195634,200195634
201673,423189,GILD,Gilead s  GILD  HBV Drug Vemlidy Receives Approval In Canada ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced that hepatitis B virus  HBV  drug Vemlidy has been approved in Canada 
Health Canada granted a Notice of Compliance  NOC  for Vemlidy 25mg tablets  a once daily treatment for adults with chronic HBV infection with compensated liver disease 
The approval was supported by positive data from the 48 week data from two international phase 3 studies among treatment na ve and treatment experienced adult patients with chronic HBV infection 
Vemlidy showed antiviral efficacy similar to and at a dose less than one tenth that of Gilead s other HBV drug  Viread  The data also showed that Vemlidy has greater plasma stability and delivers tenofovir to hepatocytes more efficiently compared to Viread  As a result  it can be administered at a lower dose  resulting in less tenofovir in the bloodstream which in turn leads to better renal and bone laboratory safety parameters compared to Viread 
Both studies met their primary endpoint of non inferiority to Viread  The study was based on the percentage of patients with chronic hepatitis B with plasma HBV DNA levels below 29 IU mL at 48 weeks of therapy  Moreover  patients in the Vemlidy arm also experienced numerically higher rates of normalization of blood serum alanine aminotransferase  ALT  levels 
We note that the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Vemlidy in Jan 2017  The drug was also approved by the FDA in Nov 2016  
The approval will strengthen Gilead s HBV portfolio which comprises Viread and Hepsara 
However  Gilead s HBV portfolio faces competition from Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   Baraclude and Novartis    NYSE NVS   Tyzeka Sebivo 
We note that Gilead is a leading player in both the HIV and HCV markets  However  the HCV franchise has been under pressure for a while now due to competitive pressure  This in turn has led to a sharp decline in share price 

Shares of Gilead have underperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the last year  with the stock losing 19 9  during this period  compared with the industry s gain of 2 0  
The HIV franchise of Gilead is performing well and should help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise

    Our TakeAlthough the first quarter results beat on earnings  revenues missed expectations  The HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales  The company expects that the persistent decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary factor behind the year over year decrease in revenues in 2017 along with increased competition which will impact patient share and pricing  This decline in patient starts is being driven by the evolving profile of patients that are in care  We note that Harvoni  Sovaldi and Epclusa  face competition from AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   Daklinza among others  On a positive note  Epclusa s uptake has been encouraging and the drug is now launched in all the five major markets of Europe  Meanwhile  the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens  The TAF based regimens now represent 42  of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016  Genvoya is now the company s bestselling HIV product  surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth quarter 2016 Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting should also boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 125 000 patients using Truvada by the end of the first quarter  However  Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U S  which should impact sales

201702,423218,GILD,Regeneron  REGN  To Post Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   is scheduled to release first quarter 2017 results on May 4  before the opening bell  The company s performance has been mixed so far  In the last four reported quarters  it surpassed earnings estimates on three occasions and missed the same once  Overall  the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 8 1  

Regeneron s share price movement shows that the stock underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last six months  Specifically  the stock rallied 6 1  during this period  while the industry gained 7 9  
Last quarter  Regeneron missed earnings expectations by 12 75   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Regeneron s key growth driver  Eylea  should continue to contribute to the company s top line growth  Regeneron continued to witness strong sales growth for the eye treatment in both the U S  and ex U S  markets  However  growth for the drug has slowed down and the company expects growth in single digits in 2017  We note that Regeneron has a global development and commercialization agreement with Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY   outside the U S  for Eylea  Product revenues from ex U S  Eylea sales are recorded by Bayer 
The company is working on expanding Eylea s label into diabetic retinopathy in an ongoing phase III study 
Apart from Eylea  investors will remain focused on the performance of the PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent  The challenge for the PCSK9 inhibitor class continues to be the significant reimbursement hurdle for the physicians  offices and patients which in turn have resulted in a low volume of prescriptions being dispensed   Sales of Praluent have failed to impress so far 
On Feb 8  the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed the injunction pending appeal  Hence  Regeneron and partner Sanofi   NYSE SNY   will continue marketing  selling  and manufacturing Praluent in the U S  during the appeal process 
During the quarter  the FDA approved its Dupixent  dupilumab  Injection for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD   Per the companies  this is the first and only biologic medicine approved for the treatment of adults suffering from AD  Regeneron and Sanofi will launch Dupixent in the U S  at the Wholesale Acquisition Cost  WAC  of  37 000 annually  Pricing will play a key role in the uptake of the drug and we expect management to throw light on the same 
On the first quarter earnings call  focus will be on the company s performance  particularly Eylea and Praluent  The FDA has approved the new supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  for a once monthly  every four weeks   300 mg dose of Praluent  alirocumab  Injection for the treatment of adults with high low density lipoprotein  LDL  cholesterol  The approval will expand the drug s dosing options 
Investors are also expected to await updates on the company s pipeline   Earlier in the month  Regeneron and Sanofi announced that the European Medicine Agency s  EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has adopted a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Kevzara  sarilumab   while the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to its pipeline candidate evinacumab for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia  HoFH  
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Regeneron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  2 50  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Although the company s rank is favorable  the 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult

Factors Influencing This Quarter
Apart from license fees  Keryx s top line comprises revenues generated by its only marketed product Auryxia  ferric citrate   Auryxia is approved as tablets to control serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease  CKD  on dialysis 
Notably  with Auryxia being the only approved product in Keryx s portfolio  the company is entirely dependent on it for growth  Launched in the U S  in late Dec 2014  Auryxia is still in its early stages of commercialization  Insufficient reimbursement and lengthy selling cycles have impacted the ramp up in Auryxia s sales 
However  Keryx is working on its commercial efforts for Auryxia  In fact  the company is currently working on gaining formulary status for the drug  Additionally  it is operating on contracting the remaining insurance providers to expand patient access to Auryxia  This should enable more contact with the prescribers  both current physicians and those who have not prescribed Auryxia yet  The company expanded its field based team to 95 sales representatives 
Moreover  Keryx is working on expanding ferric citrate s  the compound name for Auryxia in additional indications  label to include the treatment of iron deficiency anemia  IDA  in patients with stage III V non dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease indication  NDD CKD   In Mar 2017  the FDA accepted the company s supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for Auryxia for review  PDUFA date  Nov 6  2017   If approved for this indication  Auryxia could be the first FDA approved oral medicine to treat IDA in this patient population  A potential approval will significantly boost sales of Auryxia Keryx Biopharmaceuticals  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Keryx this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 18 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Keryx s has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult for the quarter 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum

Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

201704,423220,GILD,Is Intercept  ICPT  Poised For A Beat This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   is scheduled to report first quarter 2017 results on May 4  before the market opens 
In the last reported quarter  the company missed expectations by 35 2   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

Intercept s share price movement in the last six months reveals that the stock underperformed the Zacks classified  industry  The company s shares lost 8 1  during this period  which compares unfavorably with the industry s 7 8  gain 
Surprise History
Intercept s track record has been mixed so far  with the company surpassing expectations in three of the last four quarters  The company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 2 06  over this period Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 
   Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Intercept is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is at  9 13   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of  3 38 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of  4 27  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Intercept currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  The combination of Zacks Rank  3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release 
On the other hand  Sell rated stocks    4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors at Play
Intercept received a major boost with the FDA approval  in May 2016  of its lead drug  Ocaliva  in combination with ursodeoxycholic  UDCA   for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to bear with UDCA  Ocaliva generated sales of  4 7 million in the last quarter  In Dec 2016  the European Commission also granted conditional approval to Ocaliva for the same indication 
Meanwhile  Ocaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and primary sclerosing cholangitis  PSC  
Intercept expects operating expenses in the range of  380  420 million in 2017 to support the continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets  sustained clinical development for OCA in PBC and NASH and the continued advancement of INT 767 and other pipeline programs  The initial uptake of Ocaliva has been encouraging and sales of the drug should pick up further in 2017 
However  sales in the first quarter will be impacted due to higher gross net impact early in the year while patients navigate through the annual change of insurance carriers and benefits  This in turn can cause patients to have their benefits reauthorized and result in a delay in approval 
We expect investors to remain focused on sales ramp up of Ocaliva and pipeline updates on Intercept s first quarter call  The FDA recently approved a redesign of the phase III trial  REGENERATE on Ocaliva for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis  The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint  either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared to the earlier target of achieving both 
The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm  The company plans to complete enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial by mid 2017  data readout in 2019  
Meanwhile  Intercept also initiated a phase II study  CONTROL  Combination OCA aNd sTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids   on OCA  The study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of OCA in combination with statin therapy on lipid metabolism in patients with NASH  Enrolment in the study was completed in third quarter 2016  with data expected in 2017

201705,423221,GILD,What To Expect From Endocyte  ECYT  Stock For Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Endocyte  Inc   NASDAQ ECYT   is expected to report first quarter 2017 results on May 3  In fact  the company has an impressive track record  having beaten estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and reporting in line results in the remaining quarter  Overall  the company has recorded an average positive surprise of 5 52  
In the last reported quarter  Endocyte missed expectations by 4   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Endocyte s share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date  The stock was down nearly 9 8  as against the industry s gain of approximately 4 9  during the same timeframe 

Factors at Play
Being a biotech company in development stage  Endocyte does not have any approved product in its portfolio  Investors are thus expected to keep an eye on the company s pipeline development  Endocyte s pipeline presently comprises EC1456 and EC1169 
EC1456  second generation folate targeted agent which is being studied as second line treatment for non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  is identified by the companion imaging agent etarfolatide  The company has initiated the expansion phase of the study on EC1456 in the selected folate receptor positive NSCLC cancer patients 
Patients included in this expansion phase of the trial will receive first line chemotherapy and may also be treated with anti PD 1 therapy  Initially  anti tumor response of the single agent will be evaluated  Positive results from the study would lead to its evaluation as combination therapies in indications like triple negative breast cancer  ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer 
EC1169 is being evaluated in a phase I study for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  mCRPC   The company is currently enrolling patients in the expansion phase of the EC1169 trial in up to 50 second line chemotherapy and up to 50 taxane na ve metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer  mCRPC  patients at a maximum clinical once per week dose of 6 5 mg m2 
Efficacy and safety data from the expansion cohorts for both EC1456 and EC1169 will be reported at medical conferences in the first half of 2017 Endocyte s successful development of targeted small molecule drug conjugates  SMDCs  that are able to penetrate deep into dense solid tumors and have a shorter half life is likely to help the company gain an edge over existing therapies  This biotech company uses its proprietary technology platform to develop various new SMDCs for a range of diseases 
In addition  the company is working on the development of companion imaging agents that help to identify patients most likely to benefit from its product  upon approval  This should help in expanding the market for SMDCs  thereby boosting growth at the company  However  with no approved product in its portfolio at the moment  Endocyte has to depend heavily on its partners for top line growth

In the last reported quarter  the company topped expectations with a positive earnings surprise of 4 44   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Zoetis  share price movement year to date shows that the stock has outperformed the Zacks classified  industry  The stock gained 5 0  compared with industry s gain of 4 9  during this period 

Factors to Consider
Zoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals  The company continues to strengthen its diverse portfolio of products through lifecycle innovations  strong customer relationships  and access to new markets and technologies 
Notably  the company s companion animal business has been performing well  It expects to see stronger growth from its companion animal portfolio in 2017 driven by its dermatology portfolio  Apoquel and Cytopoint  further penetration of Simparica  and ongoing uptake of new vaccines 
In May 2015  Zoetis had announced comprehensive operational efficiency initiatives that are expected to generate cost savings of more than  300 million by the end of 2017  These initiatives have focused on simplifying its product portfolio through the elimination of approximately 5 000 product stock keeping units  changing its selling approach in certain markets  reducing presence in certain countries  and the sale of exit from 10 manufacturing sites over the long term 
As of December 31  2016  the company has divested or exited three U S  manufacturing sites  two international manufacturing sites  and its 55  ownership share of a Taiwan joint venture  inclusive of its related manufacturing site  The company eliminated about 1 800 positions and additional reductions are expected mainly over the next six months We are positive on Zoetis  acquisitions made so far  In Aug 2016  the company acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices   developer and manufacturer of microfluidic  lab on a chip  diagnostic analyzers and tests for veterinary point of care services   in a transaction valued at  80 million  This acquisition has added a suite of specialty test instruments and cartridges to Zoetis  complementary point of care diagnostics portfolio 
Also  the buyout has gained late  and mid stage pipeline candidates that are expected to bring a range of new point of care analyzers and tests to market and contribute to several diagnostic product launches over the next few years in order to help veterinarians better detect  prevent and treat diseases 
In Apr 20 17  Zoetis entered into an agreement with Nexvet Biopharma under which Zoetis  through a wholly owned subsidiary will purchase the later  Nexvet is an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals  The purchase price for the deal is  85 million The acquisition is expected to strengthen Zoetis  pipeline of solutions for chronic pain management in dogs and cats  which represents an area of high need in companion animal health 
However  Zoetis lowered its guidance for 2017 concurrent with its fourth quarter results  Management expects revenue growth to be negatively impacted from product rationalization  especially in the first two quarters of the year  Other headwinds also include disease outbreaks and stiff competition in the animal health space

Radius  shares underperformed the  industry in the last six months  The stock lost 17 6  during this time period as compared to a gain of 10 1  for the industry 
Radius Health has a disappointing track record so far  The company missed estimates in three of the four trailing quarters with a negative average surprise of 5 4  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors at Play
Radius Health focuses on the development of therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis  oncology and endocrine diseases 
On Apr 28  Radius Health announced that the FDA has approved its lead candidate Tymlos  abaloparatide  injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture  multiple risk factors for fracture  or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy 
Hence  we expect investors to focus on the impending launch during the upcoming earnings call 
The company has been gearing for a potential launch in both the U S and the EU  and has thus increased its headcount  Radius is also looking for a commercialization partner for Tymlos outside the U S  prior to commercial launch  The company also expects to report top line results from the 24 month ACTIVExtend clinical trial in second quarter 2017 
Meanwhile  Raduis is also developing abaloparatide TD for potential use as a short wear time transdermal patch  In Dec 2015  the company initiated a human replicative clinical evaluation to compare the optimized abaloparatide TD patch with its subcutaneous formulation  The company posted positive results from the trial in Sep 2016 
The company is currently focused on completing the manufacturing  scale up  and other required activities needed to initiate a pivotal study to evaluate bioequivalence to abaloparatide SC  The transdermal patch program has the potential to allow physicians who treat osteoporosis but rarely use injectable drugs to expand their practices to include the use of anabolic therapy 
Other candidates in Radius Health s pipeline include RAD1901  in hormone driven and or hormone resistant breast cancer  and vasomotor symptoms in post menopausal women  and RAD140  multiple indications including cancer   During the fourth quarter  Radius Health reported encouraging results of its ongoing phase I studies of RAD1901 in advanced breast cancer 
The company plans to file with regulatory agencies in order to take the next steps for the program in the first half of 2017  which would include the design of a phase II trial  Additionally  it anticipates to report results from its completed phase IIb trial in vasomotor symptoms in the first half of 2017 
Furthermore  the company submitted an investigational new drug application  to the FDA for RAD140  which is a selective androgen receptor modulator  Moving ahead  it expects to commence a first in human phase I study in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer in 2017 
Research and development expenses are expected to record an upside thanks to pipeline development activities

Bristol Myers has a decent track record so far  The company s earnings beat estimates in three of the four trailing quarters  with an average positive surprise of 7 26   Will Bristol Myers surpass expectations this time as well 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors to Impact Q1
Bristol Myers  high profile immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  should continue to drive the company s top line in the to be reported quarter  Opdivo s U S  sales are driven by the melanoma  second line non small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications 
Further  recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications should boost the drug s sales   However  the lung cancer market in the U S became more competitive in 2016 due to the entry of Tecentriq 
Bristol Myers expects the second line lung cancer business to be under competitive pressure  As a result  sales of the drug in the U S is projected be flat in 2017  A potential earlier than expected entry of Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy will also adversely impact sales  Sales of Opdivo are projected to grow globally 
The virology business is expected to decline significantly in 2017 due to competition from Epclusa  The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure  Particularly  recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise 
The company trimmed its earnings guidance in Jan 2017 due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and a potential earlier than expected entry of the Keytruda chemo combination in May  The company now expects earnings in the range of  2 70  2 90 per share  
R D expenses are expected to increase in the high single digit range  Marketing  selling and administrative expenses are anticipated to decrease in mid  to high  single digit range  The company expects operating expenses to be roughly flat with 2016 levels through 2020 
On the first quarter earnings call  investors are expected to focus on the company s performance and label expansion efforts  along with updates on business development activities 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bristol Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as elaborated below

201715,423231,GILD,What To Expect From Prothena  PRTA  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Prothena Corporation plc   NASDAQ PRTA   is expected to report first quarter 2017 results early next month 
Last quarter  the company recorded a negative earnings surprise of 13 71   In fact  Prothena s track record has been dismal so far  The company reported a wider than expected loss in all the four trailing quarters  with an average negative surprise of 16 11  
Prothena s share price increased 11 6  in the past one year as against the Zacks classified  industry s gain of 3 2  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at Play
Prothena s top line primarily comprises collaboration revenues earned through its license  development and commercialization agreements  In fact  the company earns collaboration revenues mainly under its license agreement with Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   for PRX002 
We believe  investor focus should remain on pipeline updates by the company as it has no approved product in its portfolio 
PRX002 is currently in phase Ib study in patients with Parkinson s disease  The company expects to initiate a phase II study in patients with Parkinson s disease in 2017 
Other key pipeline candidates include NEOD001 for the treatment of AL amyloidosis and PRX003 for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis PRX003 is being evaluated in a phase Ib multiple ascending dose study  Interim and full results from the study are expected this year  Currently  the VITAL study on NEOD001 is on track  The company expects to complete enrollment by the second quarter of 2017  Additionally  the company expects top line results from this study in early 2018 Moving ahead  like any other development stage biotechnology company  Prothena is likely to see an increase in research and development expenses due to higher spending on pipelineWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Prothena this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Prothena is   3 79   because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 37  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 1 32  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   
Zacks Rank  Though Prothena s Zacks Rank  3  Sell  increases the predictive power of ESP  its negative ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult   
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Prothena Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks to Consider
Here are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Fibrogen Inc    NASDAQ FGEN   has an Earnings ESP of  23 81  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release results on May 8  You can see

201716,423232,GILD,The Stock Market Is Up But My Hopes Are Down,opinion,"There is an eight foot broadleaf evergreen directly outside my office door  Normally  I would not give it a second s glance  Recently  however  a hummingbird has been buzzing about the greenery  And with good reason  Two hatchlings have arrived  requiring food as well as warmth 
In spite of my presence  the mother has been expressing an unusual amount of audacity  She does not flinch when I walk near the nest  And when she s out gathering insects to feed her young  she returns to the shrub as if she owns it  My colleague Rob jokingly suggested that we name the siblings  Irrational  and  Exuberance  
The investing public is confident alright  There s no doubt about that  There has never been as much leverage in the market based financial system as there is right now 
Consider margin debt  It is hitting all time records alongside the major stock market averages  And while there s no sure fire way to determine when stock market ascension or brokerage account borrowing will subside  skyrocketing leverage tends to peak at exceptionally inconvenient moments  that is  when the act of borrowing to buy stocks swan dives  bubbly stock prices typically head south for the winter  spring  summer and or fall 

Take a look at the chart above  Leverage as seen in the red line surged in 1999  only to abruptly reverse course by March of 2000  The tech bubble popped in March of 2000   Note  The S P 500 hung in there until August of 2000 before giving way to a two year  six month price evisceration  Similarly  as measured by margin debt increases  investor enthusiasm catapulted higher in 2006  By mid 2007  though  leverage made a hasty retreat  And by October of 2007  stocks cratered  They reached unimaginable lows nineteen harrowing months later 
Some strategists argue that there is nothing irrational or overly exuberant about borrowing the most that one can from his her brokerage account  He she can buy stocks  finance a trip around the globe or even come up with more money for a real estate acquisition  And at these ultra low interest rates  why not 
Here s the problem  When stocks reverse direction  clients receive a  margin call   Either they come up with cash to replenish margin account requirements or they must liquidate holdings  Obviously  they do not have the cash available  between their obligations to mortgages  auto leases and student loans  Not only is household debt to income at an unsustainable 130   but household savings rates at 5  are a fraction of what they were in the 1970s and 1980s 
It follows that forced portfolio liquidation contributes to falling stock prices which  in turn  breeds additional involuntary selling  In other words  while borrowing to buy stocks bolsters higher and higher stock prices for a period  it eventually contributes to a rapid fire descent 
Debt has been the answer for households to maintain their standards of living since the early 1990s  The massive rise in household credit has leveraged families to a point of questionable return  e g   mortgage  auto  education  revolving credit cards  etc   

Unfortunately  that s not the half of it  Get a gander at what one might refer to as Credit Balance  Credit Balance results from subtracting margin debt from Free Credit Cash Accounts and credit balances within margin accounts  What we see is that negative Credit Balances have never been this far out of whack  Not during the tech bubble  And not during the housing collapse  Simply stated  stock market investors are more exuberant than ever before 

Perhaps there are relatively rational reasons for investors to be exceptionally bullish  Low borrowing costs  No obvious sign of an imminent economic recession  Trump tax and regulatory reform  And most glaringly  Tens of trillions of dollars making their way into riskier assets care of globally coordinated central bank intervention 

On the flip side  the notion that there must be an easy to spot catalyst prior to a bearish retreat in prices is false  The Fed may have been raising rates too rapidly leading into the turn of the century  Yet there was nothing in March of 2000 that served as an immediate impetus for the tech wreck that followed 
Here s what I do know   1  Household debt  corporate debt  government debt and investor debt have never been as ugly as right this minute   2  Traditional metrics have rarely pointed to more  than what we are witnessing today   3  Traditional metrics still matter  in spite of    4  Non recession stock bears are common  as are ultra low interest rate bears  meaning neither an expanding economy nor a low rate environment can prevent 20  price declines  and  5  Deficit mindful Republicans are not inclined to  that increases the national debt  let alone a package that seems to favor the wealthiest among us 
As long as valuations and leverage levels push the upper limits of greed  I will continue to maintain a more modest allocation to equity  Stock allocation for my moderate growth and income clients rests at 50   cash and cash equivalents sit closer to 25  for the ability to acquire assets at more attractive price levels 
Is there anything that I would buy in the current environment  I am partial to a few individual companies like Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD   In contrast  it is exceptionally challenging to add to exchange traded stock index funds  ETFs  when few  if any  register as bargains  I crave the ability to buy lower when the crowd is petrified of its own silhouette

201724,423240,GILD,Gilead  GILD  HCV Drugs Gets FDA Nod For Label Expansion,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced that the FDA approved additional indications for Harvoni  ledipasvir 90 mg sofosbuvir 400 mg  tablets and Sovaldi  sofosbuvir 400 mg  tablets  These drugs can now be used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection in adolescents without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis  12 years of age and older or weighing at least 35kg 
Shares of Gilead underperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the last one year with the stock losing 30 4  during this period  compared with the industry s decline of 9 5  

 
We remind investors that while Harvoni is already approved for pediatric patients with genotype 1  4  5 or 6 chronic HCV infection  Sovaldi was approved for pediatric patients with genotype 2 or 3 chronic HCV infection in combination with ribavirin 
Hence  the approvals of Sovaldi and Harvoni will benefit patients from interferon free treatment for HCV infection  As per estimates  of the 23 000 46 000 pediatric HCV patients in the U S   most are infected with the virus at birth 
As a result of the approvals  children aging 12 and older in the U S  with genotypes 1 to 6 chronic HCV infection will now have the option of two direct acting antiviral regimens that offer high cure rates and eliminate the need for interferon injections 
However  Gilead s HCV franchise continued to witness slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2016 across key markets including the U S  and Europe  reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure  HCV product sales were weaker than expected due to fewer new patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient 
Higher discounts and payer mix continue to hurt sales  Lower patient starts were also observed in the early launch markets in Germany and France while Spain and Italy continued to experience budgetary constraints  Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely 
Moreover  Harvoni  Sovaldi and Epclusa  face competition from AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Gilead Sciences currently carries Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Better ranked stocks in the health care sector are Heska Corp    NASDAQ HSKA   and Retrophin  Inc    NASDAQ RTRX    Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
You can see  
Heska s earnings per share estimates increased from  1 53 to  1 65 for 2017 and from  1 90 to  2 01 for 2018 over the last 30 days  The company posted a positive surprise in three of the four trailing quarters with an average beat of 291 54  
Retrophin s loss per share estimates narrowed from 85 cents to 72 cents for 2017 and from 67 cents to 53 cents for 2018 over the last 60 days  The company posted positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters  with an average beat of 80 55

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Drug Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Friday

The bulk of the Q3 earnings season is over  with 364 S P 500 members  as of Nov 2    accounting for 72 6  of the index s total market capitalization   having already reported results  according to the latest  

While total earnings for these index members were up 1 6  from the year ago quarter  revenues were also up 1 6  year over year  The beat ratio was 72 3  for earnings and 54 7  for revenues 
	Notably  the ongoing reporting cycle is on track to be the first quarter of positive earnings growth after five consecutive quarters of earnings decline for the S P 500 index  However  though the third quarter reporting cycle saw numerous positive surprises and stability in current quarter  Q4 2016  estimates in the beginning  these two attributes have started losing ground this week  Positive surprises  particularly on the revenue side  have become harder to come by and Q4 estimates are moving down 

This change was reflected in the results of pharmaceutical companies as well  Though quite a few of the large cap pharma companies posted better than expected third quarter results last week  three large pharma companies that have reported so far this week   Allergan plc s  NYSE            Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ           and Pfizer Inc   NYSE             announced softer than expected Q3 results  While Allergan and Pfizer missed estimates for both earnings and sales  Gilead managed to beat sales expectations marginally but missed earnings estimates 

Two more companies from the healthcare sector are set to report their third quarter results on Nov 4  Let s see how things are shaping up for their respective announcements 

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ          

Regeneron posted a positive surprise of 21 97  last reported  The company s performance has been mixed so far  In the last four quarters  it surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed the same twice  Overall  the company has recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 2 04  

Regeneron s key growth driver  Eylea  should continue to perform well in the third quarter of 2016 and contribute meaningfully to the top line  Apart from Eylea  investor focus will remain on the performance of the PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent   Read More     

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at  2 27 per share  The company has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of 0 00   Please check our  that enables you find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 

Lion Biotechnologies  Inc    NASDAQ

201757,423273,GILD,How Cheap Can Gilead Sciences Get ,opinion,"With the self destruction of Donald Trump s presidential campaign  it seems like the market is pricing in a Hillary Clinton presidential win come November 8th 
In particular  the biotech and major pharmaceutical companies have been smashed over the past half year  with some stocks like Gilead losing almost 30  in this short period of time 
While drops like these may rattle the impatient and fearful investor or trader  we as value investors should be licking our lips for such a tasty opportunity 
The following is what s making me add even more Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  stock to our long term investing portfolio 
Please note  I am both a long term deep value investor as well as a medium term trader who utilizes the combination of both fundamental  technical and macro analysis to form a view of every investment I make  Doing so I believe leads to  over the long run 
Fundamental Factors  The Bad
Earnings Per Share is forecasted to decline 
Return on Equity  ROE  of over 80  is excellent but is forecast to decline as well 
The biggest risk here is the potential for future government enforced pricing regulations of the pharmaceutical and biotech industry as a whole if Clinton comes into power post November US elections 
The Good
Fair value with intrinsic valuation of  72  80  approx   
Priced at less than six times this year s and next year s earnings  If this isn t cheap  I m not sure what is  The  Clinton fear factor  seems to already be priced in 
Earnings per share  EPS  have been great for the past 5 years 
Long term cash flow relative to reported profits is strong 
Gilead has a long term funding surplus 
Massive cash and investments of over  22 billion dollars on its Balance Sheet 
Consistent big stock buybacks is likely to continue 
Technical Factors  The Bad
Recently broken below the  78 key price support level  with next key price support at  70 
Currently below all 20  50 and 200 day moving averages 
The Good
The stock is oversold on a variety of momentum indicators 
Price is close to its 3 year lows at current price levels 
Other Factors
For longer term investments and trades  I generally like to see who else is on board with me and where the smart money has found its home 
In my opinion  actions always speak louder than words  GILD is held by a lot of smart money managers 
Ronald Muhlenkamp   7 073  of portfolio managed
Jerome Dodson   3 23  of portfolio managed
David Carlson   2 77  of portfolio managed
Zeke Ashton   2 71  of portfolio managed
Samuel Isaly   2 01  of portfolio managed
Conclusion
The dramatic 30  price fall of Gilead Sciences in the past half year has brought the stock back to below fair value for a wonderfully managed bio tech company with plenty of smart money support 
To avoid catching the proverbial falling knife  we ll wait for a buying momentum shift upwards before adding any more Gilead Sciences for our long term portfolio

compensation expenses  of  2 70 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 74 and were down 15 4  from the year ago quarter figure Moreover  total revenue in the reported quarter came in at  7 5 billion  down 9 6  year over year  Nevertheless  quarterly revenues marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 4 billion HCV Franchise Disappoints Again  HIV ImpressesProduct sales came in at  7 4 billion  down 9 8  year over year and 3 2  sequentially  The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus  HCV  sales  partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas  Sequentially  there was an increase in HIV sales and HCV sales in the U S   and other products  offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe Antiviral product sales  which include Gilead s HIV and liver disease portfolios  came in at  6 8 billion in the third quarter of 2016  down 11 2  HCV product sales  which include Harvoni  Sovaldi and the recently launched Epclusa  were  3 3 billion  down 31 3  mainly due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi HCV product sales in the U S  came in at  2 billion  down 37  year over year  mainly attributable to lower patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient  This was primarily a result of a higher percentage of sales that were made in more deeply discounted segments  The figure was also down 12  sequentially Total HCV revenue in Europe in the third quarter was  604 million  down 30  year over year and 22  sequentially  This was attributed to lower HCV patient starts in the early launch markets like Germany and France Sales of Harvoni plunged 44 2  year over year to  1 9 billion in the reported quarter  The decline was mainly due to lower sales in the U S   down 57 3  to  1 1 billion  and Europe  down 28 6  to  380 million   Further  Sovaldi sales recorded a year over year decline of 43 7  to  825 million Epclusa garnered sales of  640 million in the reported quarter  significantly higher than  64 million reported in the prior quarter  We note that Epclusa was launched in the U S  and Europe in June and July  respectively Meanwhile  HIV and other antiviral product sales came in at  3 5 billion  up 20 7  year over year and approximately 13  sequentially  The increase was primarily driven by continually strong uptake of tenofovir alafenamide  TAF  based products  Genvoya  which generated sales of  461 million  up from  302 million in the second quarter of 2016  Descovy  which recorded sales of  88 million  up from  61 million in the second quarter of 2016  and Odefsey  which registered sales of

performed well  However  Atripla sales tanked 20 5  to  650 million  while Truvada sales fell 5  to  858 million Other products  that is Letairis  Ranexa  AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of  215 million  up 18 8     170 million  up 5 6     91 million  up 3 4   and  39 million  up 8 3    respectively Research   development  R D  expenses  including stock based compensation expenses  were up 35 4  to  1 billion  The increase was primarily due to overall development of the company s clinical studies  including a  200 million milestone expense associated with the acquisition of Nimbus Apollo  Inc Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses  including stock based compensation expenses  were down 8 1  to  827 million primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense Adjusted product gross margin was 87 6   down from 89 6  in the year ago period 2016 Guidance ReiteratedGilead maintained its outlook for 2016  The company continues to expect net product sales in the range of  29 5  30 5 billion Adjusted R D expenses and adjusted SG A expenses are still projected in the range of  3 6  3 8 billion and  3 1  3 3 billion  respectively Adjusted product gross margin for 2016 is still predicted in the range of 88 90  Dividend and Share RepurchaseGilead declared its fourth quarter 2016 dividend  The company will pay a quarterly cash dividend of 47 cents per share

share repurchase program GILEAD SCIENCES Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Our TakeGilead s third quarter results were far from encouraging  with the company missing earnings expectations and marginally beating top line estimates  Moreover  both earnings and revenues declined year over year  We expect investors to react negatively to the news  Nevertheless  Gilead has maintained its outlook for 2016  Its HCV franchise has been under competitive and pricing pressure  which led to a disappointing performance  especially the sales decline of both Harvoni and Sovaldi However  Epclusa s uptake has been encouraging  The HIV franchise performed encouragingly as well  thanks to Genvoya  Descovy and Odefsey  The company also revealed quite a few setbacks related to its pipeline on the

201781,423297,GILD,GILD  Cheap Dividend Growth Or Value Trap ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   the dominant antiviral and hepatitis drug company  is starting to draw a lot of attention from value oriented investors due to its decline of 23  over the past year 
Gilead s stock now trades at a high single digit price to earnings multiple which typically has many bargain hunters salivating  especially in a market where many quality  and  trade at over 20x earnings 
Furthermore  Gilead initiated a dividend in the second quarter of 2015 for the first time since the company s founding in 1987 and now yields 2 4  with strong dividend growth potential 
With a low payout ratio  cheap P E multiple  and a history of phenomenal growth  should  jump on the opportunity to own a stock that has returned nearly 400  over the last decade or are they getting lured into a value trap Business AnalysisGilead Sciences is a global biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical needs 
Gilead s main focus is on human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   liver diseases such as hepatitis  oncology and inflammations  and cardiovascular and respiratory conditions 
In 2015  they generated sales of  32 6 billion  the most in company history  Their main competitors in the industry include other large global biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  Their products compete based on efficacy  safety  tolerability  acceptance by doctors  ease of use  insurance coverage  distribution and marketing 
Gilead s main therapeutics are Harvoni  Liver Diseases   Sovaldi  Liver Diseases   Truvada  HIV   Atripla  HIV   Stribild  HIV   Complera Eviplera  HIV   and Viread  Liver Diseases   All of these therapeutics generated sales in excess of one billion dollars in 2015 
Gilead has significant revenue concentration from its main drugs  The company s top ten drugs generated around 97  of their revenue in 2015 with the top three generating around 69  
Furthermore  their top therapeutic  Harvoni  generated sales of about  13 9 billion  or nearly 43  of their total revenue for the year 
It goes without saying that dividend investors need to be very comfortable with the outlook for these drugs to ever consider investing in Gilead Sciences regardless of the attractiveness of the valuation and the current important financial ratios 
The patent protection periods on their top drugs look okay with Harvoni covered until 2030  Sovaldi until 2029  Truvada until 2021  but only 2017 in the European Union   Atripla until 2021  but again only 2017 in the EU   Stribild until 2029  Complera Eviplera until 2022  and Viread until 2018 
Thus  with the benefits of patent protection lasting for at least 4 5 years on their major drugs  and much longer on Harvoni  then why are the shares so cheap today 
It all comes down to the market believing that Gilead s best days are behind the company  After all  it s hard to imagine the company s surge in margins earnings the last few years will be repeated  or possibly even sustained  
As seen below  Gilead s operating margins surged from roughly 40  in fiscal year 2013 to nearly 70  in 2015 thanks to high priced treatments Sovaldi  FDA approval in late 2012  and Harvoni  released in October 2014   Diluted earnings per share increased by a factor of 10 from 2013 to 2015 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Product sales for their HIV and liver disease areas were down 1 3  for the six months ended June 30th  2016  with the decline accelerating in the second quarter for a nearly 6  slump 
Even more concerning  U S  product sales were down 12  year over year in the quarter and HCV product sales were down 33  due to lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates  discounts from payer mix  and less new patients starting Harvoni 
Harvoni is a major concern because sales are down over 22  through the first six months of the year  This trend is not getting any better as the sales decline accelerated in the second quarter of 2016 with sales falling nearly 29  from Q2 2015 levels in this key drug 
Furthermore  during the second quarter  Gilead slightly lowered its expectations for full year sales from  30    31 billion to  29 5    30 5 billion  This implies that management expects sales to fallaround 6  year over year from 2015 levels 
Let s dig in a bit further to understand the key drivers of the declining sales 
Here is the CFO  Robin Washington  discussing the trends on the second quarter conference call 
 While we are seeing continued strength in non HCV product sales  given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV  our updated models suggest net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below  30 billion for the year The factors contributing to this conclusion include lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segment in the U S  and continues with a lower net average price in Europe  a trend toward slowing patient starts in the U S  commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe  a continued gradual trend towards shorter duration and loss of some market share to competition  
These trends are clearly not good for Harvoni  which contributed well over 40  of their 2015 revenue  Sales could continue to fall if the current business trends continue and competition intensifies 
Furthermore  AbbVie and Merck  NYSE MRK  have entered the HCV space with new products  If the competition s new therapies continue to show promise  we would expect sales for Harvoni  and some of their other antiviral products to come under even more pressure 
Overall  there remains a lot of uncertainty surrounding the business  When looking for prospective investments for our Top Dividend Stocks portfolio  we do not like to see such sales concentration in top products because it significantly increases uncertainty and could lead to dividend cuts if a company s financials really deteriorate 
While the biotech industry has numerous appealing qualities  e g  high barriers to entry with steep R D requirements and regulations  products can take 10  years to develop  patent protection and intellectual property result in excellent margins for successful drugs   it s nearly impossible to pick the winners beforehand and predict how new drugs in the pipeline will play out 
Making forecasts is further complicated thanks to healthcare reform changing consumers  insurance policies  public funding issues for some of Gilead s major customers  and increased industry scrutiny over pricing  e g  Harvoni s wholesale cost runs roughly  94 000 for a full treatment  Dividend Safety AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  
Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more 
Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100  and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60  Since tracking the data  companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements 

We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated  what their track record has been  and how to use them for your portfolio 
Gilead s Dividend Safety Score is 91  which indicates that the dividend is very safe relative to other dividend paying stocks in the market 
Let s investigate the drivers behind this exceptional Safety Score 
Current 2016 forecasts expect Gilead to generate  11 49 in earnings per share  If the company maintains the current dividend  they will pay out about  1 84 per share  This implies a very conservative payout ratio of 16   but up slightly from when they initiated the dividend in 2015 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Furthermore  the company ended the second quarter of 2016 with  24 6 billion in cash and investments  This means that the company can cover the roughly  2 5 billion dollar 2016 dividend by nearly 10x with just the cash on hand 
However  the company does carry about  22 billion dollars in debt with the majority of it due in the next five years  If the company s business remains stable  we don t expect Gilead to have any difficulty refinancing this debt in coming years 
Overall  we would consider the company to be in excellent financial shape at this time  The largest risk would be the company making a large acquisition that would put the current capital structure at risk 
Here is management discussing capital allocation on the first quarter 2016 earnings conference call 
  I think as we said all along  we look at how we leverage our cash as not only being share repurchases and dividends  but also we consistently look at investing in our core pipeline as well as M A where appropriate  And similar to the amounts that you called out relative to cash  it s actually about a 17  reduction in share count  as I mentioned on the call  We have done a lot of M A as well  And I think we ll continue to do that  as John said  when the right opportunities present themselves  
Since the company sells recession resistant products  the business is not susceptible to the general economic cycle  Rather  as mentioned in the business analysis section  the largest risks to the business and sustainability of the dividend are competition with their HCV product portfolio  payer mix  and patient flow 
Right now the dividend appears to be very safe given the low payout ratios and healthy net cash position 
The key factors dividend investors need to pay attention to going forward to have confidence in the dividend s safety is M A and further erosion of the key anti viral products portfolio Dividend Growth AnalysisOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Gilead s Dividend Growth Score is 92  which indicates that its dividend growth prospects are very strong 
The main drivers of the fantastic growth score are the low payout ratio  outstanding historical earnings growth  and net cash position 
As detailed above in the Dividend Safety Section  the payout ratio is low   especially compared to other  100 billion dollar market cap stocks in this industry  However  very few companies of this size are so reliant on so few products 
While there is certainly room to move the payout ratio up  we do not believe it would be prudent to move it up to payout ratios of similarly sized companies within the industry given the aforementioned product concentration 
If management is able to skillfully diversify the revenue streams among more and more therapeutics  then we believe the payout ratio can substantially move up over time 
The company s growth in recent history is nothing short of jaw dropping  Sales have gone from  8 4 billion in 2011 to over  32 6 billion in 2015 with EPS increasing from  1 77 to  11 91 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The main drivers of the growth are from blockbusters in the antiviral portfolio  namely Harvoni  Sovaldi  and Stribild 
These growth rates are clearly not sustainable given the current absolute sales level and the difficulties the company currently faces 
Future growth will come from the pipeline and successful acquisitions 
Gilead spent  3 billion dollars on R D in 2015  a 6  increase over 2014 levels  At the end of 2015 they had 180 active clinical studies  of which 61 were Phase 3 clinical trials  Current promising new medicines include treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and HIV 
Overall  we would expect Gilead to continue to raise the dividend in line with to slightly above EPS growth as long as they are able to stabilize the current product portfolio  successfully introduce new medicines  and maintain a healthy balance sheet 
Management raised the dividend by 10  earlier this year  and future dividend growth will likely be at least in the mid  to high single digits over time ConclusionWhile there is a lot to like about Gilead  including a seemingly cheap valuation and solid positions in difficult to treat diseases  there is a lot of uncertainty in the future of the company  While some high yield dividend stocks  including General Motors  NYSE GM   have a lot of uncertainty  the drivers of that uncertainty are more knowable and easier to analyze 
In the case of Gilead  it is very difficult to have confidence given a number of factors that affect the business including product concentration  pricing initiatives by payers to reduce HCV spending  competitors launching new HCV products  discounts in new commercial payer contracts  and mix shifts in payers  VA  Medicaid  etc  which all can have large impacts on the value of the business 
The very cheap valuation is enticing  but we prefer to invest in businesses we can understand and have strong competitive positions  low customer product concentration  and a narrower range of future outcomes 
Gilead could turn out to be a very good investment at this price  but frankly  the company is outside of our circle of competence and we will not be adding a position to any of our portfolios at this time ",2016-09-09,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gild:-cheap-dividend-growth-or-value-trap-200152807,200152807
201790,423306,GILD,ETFs In Focus On Pfizer s Medivation Acquisition ,opinion,"The biotech giant  Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   and Xtandi manufacturer  Medivation  Inc    NASDAQ MDVN   entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will  Medivation for  81 50 per share in cash or a total enterprise value of about  14 billion  Pfizer s earnings are expected to get a boost immediately following the completion of the deal     
Pfizer outran other potential buyers like Merck   NYSE MRK    Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD    Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   and Sanofi   NYSE SNY    who were also in the race to acquire Medivation  according to several reports  The company rejected Sanofi s deal to acquire the company at  58 a share in the earlier part of this year  The Pfizer  Medivation deal is likely to have a significant impact on price performances of the two biotech companies and eventually on broader markets 
Is Xtandi the Main Motive Behind the Deal 
The biotech giant is speculated to benefit from the deal  especially in its cancer drugs segment  which is already a significant contributor to its business  The strong potential of Medivation s Xtandi  which is considered one of the leading prostate cancer treating drugs  is likely to boost Pfizer s business  Xtandi emerged as the biggest player in the novel hormonal therapy  NHT  domain with more than half of the market share in the second quarter  the second time in a row  
Strong growth in Xtandi s sales played an important role in boosting revenues during the second quarter  While collaboration related net sales of Xtandi in the U S  surged 11  to  165 1 million for the quarter  Ex U S  revenues soared 60  from the year ago quarter to  41 0 million  It led Medivation s collaboration revenues to jump 18  year on year to  206 2 million  Also  Xtandi is speculated to have the potential to witness strong growth in the near future 
During the second quarter earnings release  David Hung  CEO of Medivation  said   We anticipate a very exciting second half of 2016 for XTANDI as we prepare commercially for the October 22 PDUFA date for a potential U S  label amendment to include head to head data of enzalutamide versus bicalutamide  
Will the Deal Boost Pfizer s Cancer Drug Segment 
The Medivation acquisition  if it goes through  will strengthen Pfizer s cancer franchise  which currently consists of products like Ibrance  Xarelto and Sutent  Pfizer is also working on strengthening its immune oncology pipeline and the Medivation acquisition would be a good strategic fit for the company  Pfizer is already benefitting from strong growth in the oncology segment  read    
During the second quarter  Global Oncology revenues increased 54  to  1 1 billion driven by Xalkori and Ibrance  This was one of the main factors that led the company to post revenues of  13 1 billion in the quarter  increasing 11  from the year ago period  Separately  pipeline candidate talazoparib  an orally available PARP inhibitor  represents significant upside potential  PARP inhibitors are currently being considered to be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology  read

Healthcare   Biotechnology   Reports July 25  After Market Closes 
Key Takeaway
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  3 06 on  7 9 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million on the top
Sales of its Hep C medications are facing their biggest obstacle with the emergence of Merck s cheaper drug
Gilead s robust pipeline bodes well moving forward but don t expect them to turn the corner this quarter
Healthcare is one of the most volatile industries today  A single announcement can swing a stock significantly in either direction  Gilead had been on the right side of those swings as earnings continued to rise and top expectations over the past few years  However  a dismal first quarter pushed Gilead off its proverbial pedestal  Expectations for the upcoming quarter have come down considerably in light of the weak Q1 report 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  3 06 on  7 9 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million on the top  Compared to the year prior  earnings are projected to fall by 3  with sales down as much as 4   Shares are down nearly 27  from year earlier with a majority of those losses coming in the past 3 months 
Gilead rose to prominence on the back of its Hep C and HIV medication  The company is still a dominant presence in both markets but its position has started to wane  Sales for its Hep C medications face its stiffest competition after rival Merck  NYSE MRK  debuts its own drug  Merck s cheaper Hep C drugs has already started to chip away at Gilead s sales  COmbined sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi reported a 6  decline in its first quarter earnings 
With a number of new drugs in the pipeline and the recent approval of its new HCV drug Epclusa  earnings should start stabilize  Epclusa is the first drug that treats all sub types of hepatitis C  which analyst believe could generate  1 8 billion this year  Gilead s pipeline also consists of 7 late stage clinical trials and another 17 phase 2 studies in progress  For now though  investors should expect results similar to the first quarter

201830,423346,GILD,What s In Store For TransUnion  TRU  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Premium business service company TransUnion   NYSE TRU   is scheduled to release second quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Jul 26  In the last reported quarter  TransUnion s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a remarkable 20   The average earnings surprise over the last four trailing quarters is 13 41  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Toward the end of the second quarter  TransUnion acquired Auditz LLC  a healthcare services firm that utilizes sophisticated proprietary technology to help healthcare providers identify and recover payments  Notably  Auditz will bring new capabilities to TransUnion s healthcare business that will prove to be beneficial to its customers and further enhance its competitive strength and market value proposition  Although the acquisition is not likely to make any significant contribution in the to be reported quarter  its impact on attracting potential revenue contribution from other clients is irrefutable 
Also  the company collaborated with FICO and launched FICO Auto Score 9 XT  which utilized TransUnion s CreditVision data  The new score specifically caters to the auto finance marketplace and includes several innovative features like trended data from TransUnion s CreditVision 
During the quarter  TransUnion also entered into a partnership with award winning password manager and leader in online identity management  Dashlane  to create innovative services for its respective customers  The company will focus on credit monitoring  identity and fraud protection  credit information and breaches  TransUnion will also ensure Dashlane expand its distribution through its multiple partner channels in the U S  and globally 
However  TransUnion s revenues are vulnerable to macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates  employment levels  consumer confidence  accessibility of affordable credit and capital  inflation and housing demand  Economic recovery has been weak so far and  consequently  consumer spending has been constrained  Factors like these are likely to limit the company s growth prospects and adversely affect its financials 
TransUnion operates amid stiff competition  Its competitors widely vary according to its business segment  geographical market and the industry vertical that its solutions address  The intense competition restricts the company s pricing power to some degree  All these issues limit its profitability and are a strain on its bottom line 
The company expects second quarter revenues to be in the range of  405 million and  410 million  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is likely to be in the range  145 million and  150 million  while adjusted earnings are expected to be between 31 33 cents per share 
TRANSUNION Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively state that TransUnion is likely to beat earnings in the upcoming quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for an earnings beat  This is not the case here as we will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is currently at 0 00  
Zacks Rank  TransUnion carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of an earnings beat  a 0 00  ESP makes surprise predictions uncertain 
Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or  5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
American Campus Communities  Inc   NYSE ACC   has an Earnings ESP of  1 89  and a Zacks Rank  2  It is scheduled to report on Jul 25 
The Earnings ESP of Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   is  6 91  and it has a Zacks Rank  2  The company is expected to report on Jul 25

The combination for 12 weeks is approved for the treatment of patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis  Child Pugh A  and in combination with ribavirin  RBV  for patients with decompensated cirrhosis  Child Pugh B or C   Epclusa is also the first single tablet regimen approved for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 2 and 3  without the need for RBV  Physicians will however have the flexibility to consider the addition of RBV for genotype 3 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis 
EU approval was largely expected as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use had issued a favorable opinion this May  which was adopted following an accelerated review procedure GILEAD SCIENCES Price   We note that Epclusa is Gilead s third sofosbuvir based treatment to gain approval in the EU for the treatment of chronic HCV infection and is expected to complement Gilead s current HCV portfolio consisting of Sovaldi and Harvoni 
We remind investors that Epclusa gained FDA approval for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 6 chronic HCV late last month  We are encouraged by the company s efforts in expanding its HCV franchise  Competition and pricing pressure have already intensified in the HCV market with the entry of a new competitor   Merck   Co  Inc  s   NYSE MRK   Zepatier 
Meanwhile  Gilead is also evaluating a once daily fixed dose combination of Sovaldi velpatasvir plus GS 9857  an experimental NS3 protease inhibitor  in phase III studies  for the treatment of chronic genotype 1 6 HCV

Results showed that bictegravir demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetics and resistance profile when compared to currently available INSTIs   Tivicay  dolutegravir   Vitekta  elvitegravir  and Isentress  raltegravir    While bictegravir alone was highly effective against HIV 1 infected target cells  in combination with tenofovir alafenamide  TAF   Emtriva  emtricitabine  and Prezista  darunavir   it was highly synergistic against HIV 1  On the safety front  it was found to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events  AEs  and no discontinuations due to AEs

201869,423385,GILD,Stock Buybacks Up Double Digits In 1st Quarter,opinion,"S P 500 Dow Jones Indices reports first quarter stock buybacks for the S P 500 Index were higher by 12  on a year over year basis  On a quarter over quarter basis buybacks were higher by 10 6   The increase in buyback activity was supported by a quarter over quarter 15 8  increase in as reported earnings  Disappointingly though was the fact QOQ dividend payments declined 3 1   Additionally  the combination of dividends and buybacks equaled  257 65 billion and was in excess of reported earnings of  189 11 billion  This is the six straight quarter buybacks plus dividends exceeded reported earnings  Several highlights from S P s report 

The Health care sector increased 86 1  to  30 6 billion for the quarter  up from the prior quarter s  16 5 billion  as Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  spent  8 billion  ranking as the 18th largest in S P 500 history  
The Energy sector conducted only minor buybacks   2 1 billion   as it posted a 20 6  decline for the quarter and a 62 9  decline from Q1 2015 
For the ninth consecutive quarter  more than 20  of the S P 500 issues reduced their year over year diluted share count by at least 4   therefore boosting their earnings per share  EPS  by at least 4   The participation rate for significant EPS impact rose to 28 2  for Q1 2016  up from 25 8  in Q4 2015 
Total shareholder return  dividends plus buybacks  set a quarterly record of  257 6 billion in Q1 2016 and a 12 month record of  974 6 billion for the period ending in March 2016 

Howard Silverblatt  Senior Index Analyst at S P Dow Jones Indices  said   The Q4 2015 uptick in buybacks was a surprise to many in the market  but it continued in Q1 2016  The pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn of the year  which coincidentally started in early February when many earnings lock ups ended  The upswing in both expenditures and participation appears to persist in the market  meaning that the upturn in Q4 was not single shot  Looking at Q2 2016  the share count reduction trend is already baked in  as more than 20  of the issues have reduced their share count by at least 4  from Q2 2015  
Silverblatt also noted in the report cash reserves set a new record and increased 1 6  to  1 347 trillion   Shareholder returns continue to increase  as companies remain awash with cash and have access to low cost financing   especially in Europe and Asia   said Silverblatt   The rate of dividend increases has slowed  as commodity based issues remain a major uncertainty  Given the current cash flow  projections  and an expected slow and measured pace of interest rate increases in the U S  by the FOMC  companies have the ability to increase returns  as they remain under continued pressure from outside investors  
From an investor perspective  at HORAN  we prefer to see companies commit to higher dividend payments versus just an increase in buybacks  Dividends tend to be a more permanent commitment on a company s part and an indication of more consistent expected earnings  growth   where buybacks can be turned off and on at will ",2016-06-27,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-buybacks-up-double-digits-in-first-quarter-200138299,200138299

The Foster City  California based biopharmaceutical company  today that the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has approved Epclusa  the first all oral  single tablet regimen for the treatment of all six genotypes of the hepatitis C virus  HCV  
 The approval of Epclusa represents an important step forward in the global effort to control and potentially eliminate HCV as it provides a safe  simple and effective cure for the majority of HCV infected patients  regardless of genotype   said Ira Jacobson  MD  an investigator in the Epclusa clinical trials 
The FDA expedited Epclusa s approval process through its Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy program  which can be applied to potential treatments that offer major advances over existing treatments 
Gilead is already well known for its Hepatitis treatment options  and its existing drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi were responsible for nearly  4 3 billion in revenue last quarter  However  these treatments have been criticized for their high price tags  and they are only effective for patients with the first four genotypes of HCV 
While about 3 2 million people in the United States have HCV  the vast majority of patients have genotypes one and two  with less than 1  of patients contracting genotypes five and six  Nevertheless  Epclusa s simplicity and effectiveness should help give Gilead a leg up on its competition  including AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak treatment ",2016-06-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-gilead-sciences-(gild)-stock-gaining-today-200138750,200138750

201884,423400,GILD,2 Large Cap Pharmas With PDUFA Catalysts Next Month ,opinion,"It s been a busy year in biotech  and the trend looks set to continue  with a host of FDA decisions set to hit press across the coming six weeks  Here are two large cap pharmaceutical companies with PDUFA dates scheduled during June  which could pick up some upside momentum if the agency gives the drugs in question the green light for commercialization 
Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE    ALO 02
First up  Pfizer  The pharmaceutical giant submitted a new drug application  NDA  to the FDA early 2015 for its pain management candidate ALO 02  and the agency accepted the submission for review at the end of February  The drug is a reformulation of the current standard of care opioid  oxycodone  designed to deter  or even better  make impossible  abuse of the drug 
Opioid abuse has become an epidemic in the US across the last couple of decades  and costs the US government  annually  As such  abuse deterrent opioids are a particularly hot space in development stage biotech  and a number of companies  large and small  are working to bring their candidates to market  Pfizer is pretty much the leader of the pack with this ALO 02 submission  and as such  if the FDA gives it a nod come PDUFA  could be first to a potentially double digit billion dollar market  
So how does its candidate work  The drug is a combination of the active ingredient  the aforementioned oxycodone  and an opioid receptor agonist called naltrexone  When administered normally  i e  orally  the naltrexone doesn t activate and the oxycodone is released as part of an extended release system 
If it s crushed  however  which is the most common form of abuse preparation  nasal ingestion  dissolving for intravenous administration  etc   the naltrexone gets to work in its aforementioned role as a receptor agonist  The agonization of opioid receptors offsets the impact of the active oxycodone  and renders the drug ineffective 
So that s the science   what did the trials offer up with regard to indication of efficacy  and when will the FDA rule on the drug s future 
The data on which the drug s NDA is based came from two separate phase IIIs  investigating the efficacy of the treatment in patients with cancer pain  The data showed a statistical equivalence of the extended release version of the drug  Pfizer s candidate  to the current SOC IV administration  and the current SOC oral  non abuse deterrent  and so efficacy shouldn t really be a problem when it comes to the agency putting forward its decision 
The real question  and the factor on which the market will base its response to the ruling  will be the labelling  We ve seen some pretty high profile examples of abuse deterrent candidate getting advisory approval this year so far  but not picking up an abuse deterrent label  This failure to get the labelling effectively renders the approval useless  as the pain management market is already crowded  and without a differentiating quality  i e   abuse deterrence  there is no way a new drug can compete  As such  this is the part of the decision on which markets will be focusing 
The date to watch  June 8  2016 
Gilead Sciences  Inc  NASDAQ GILD   SOF VEL
On June 28  the FDA will issue its decision on Gilead s chronic hepatitis C candidate  the combination therapy Sofosbuvir Velpatasvir  The drug picked up priority review at the beginning of this year  and also holds breakthrough designation  meaning initial data is indicative of a substantial improvement in efficacy over the current SOC in this indication  Of course  preliminary data is far from indicative of efficacy at the later stages of development  so it should be taken wit ha pinch of salt as far as forming a speculative  forward bias is concerned 
So  what s the drug  As mentioned  it s a combination therapy with a target indication of hepatitis C  Gilead is regarded as the star player in the hepatitis space already  and with a number of companies currently working on novel therapeutics to target both B and C  is working on bolstering its portfolio through revitalized formulations  in this instance  a combination  of its currently approved portfolio  Sovaldi  which is the trade name for the Sofosbuvir element of this combination  is one of the most expensive drugs in the world  coming I at a little over  84 000 for a 12 week course  and generates in excess of  4 5 billion a quarter for Gilead 
The company is trying to boost its Sovaldi sales through the addition of what s called a pan genotypic NS5A inhibitor  the Velpatasvir side of this submission   which serves to boost the efficacy of the treatment across the 12 week dosing period  in patients that have genotypes of Hep C that would otherwise not be treatable with the single Sovaldi drug  That is  at least  what Gilead is hoping for 
The data on which the NDA is based comes from four phase III trials conducted across the US and Europe  and looks relatively robust  The drug performed well compared to placebo in six separate genotypes of Hep C  and aside from a few discontinuations  managed to hold together a pretty solid safety and tolerability profile 
This doesn t guarantee acceptance by the FDA  and the few discontinuations may warrant further investigation into the safety of the combination therapy  which could lead to a black label warning   but overall things look good for the combination 
The date to watch on this one  as mentioned  is the June 28 PDUFA  There s a chance we will see an advisory panel review   combination therapies  especially when it comes to chronic infections such as Hep C  often undergo an independent review before the FDA has the final word  If so  look to an early June review meeting as a chance to gain insight into the agency s final decision on the drug  One to watch  as it could sure up Gilead s dominance in hepatitis for the next decade if it gets a green light ",2016-05-27,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-are-two-large-cap-pharmas-with-pdufa-catalysts-next-month-200132618,200132618
201885,423401,GILD,Gilead s  GILD  New HCV Drug Epclusa Wins CHMP Backing,opinion,"Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   announced that the European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has rendered a positive opinion in favor of the approval of the company s marketing authorization application for Epclusa 
Gilead is looking to get Epclusa approved for the treatment of adults with all genotypes  1 6  of chronic hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection  Epclusa is an experimental pan genotypic  once daily combination of Gilead s HCV drug Sovaldi  400 mg  and velpatasvir  a pan genotypic NS5A inhibitor  100 mg  
The favorable opinion of the CHMP  which was adopted following an accelerated review procedure  will now be reviewed by the European Commission  With the CHMP issuing a positive opinion  we believe that chances of Epclusa gaining EU approval are pretty high 
We remind investors that Epclusa is currently under priority review in the U S  for the same indication  A response from the FDA is expected by Jun 28 
Epclusa could become the first pan genotypic  all oral  single tablet regimen to gain approval and will complement the company s current HCV portfolio consisting of Sovaldi and Harvoni  Competition and pricing pressure have already intensified in the HCV market with the entry of a new competitor   Merck   Co  Inc  s   NYSE MRK   Zepatier 
Meanwhile  Gilead is also evaluating a once daily fixed dose combination of Sovaldi velpatasvir plus GS 9857  an experimental NS3 protease inhibitor  in phase III studies  for the treatment of chronic genotype 1 6 HCV

201886,423402,GILD,Gilead Stock Slowing Sales  Shares Slide,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD 

Shares of GILD have been under pressure over the past month after the stock tested and closed back below its 200 day moving average  Since then  shares have slipped roughly 17  and hovering just above a 2 year low  Can GILD get back on track into the second half of the year or will it be even further off into 2017 
GILD Analyst Expectations
Analysts at Leerink Partners had the following comments on the outlook for GILD 
Gilead s US HCV Price Erosion Seems Likely to Continue Through 2016  Near Term Strong Competitive Position  Volume Only Partially Offsets Discounting  Mix  Market Effects  Given that Gilead has one of the most dominant franchises in recent industry history  GILDs investors and analysts experienced a rude awakening  as apparently did Gilead s management  when the company disclosed softening HCV sales in Q1 2016 based on growing rebates  more government purchases  and shorter treatment duration  Reported total HCV revenue declined by 12  compared to Q4 and by 6  compared to Q1 2015  These results were largely driven by the US   13  QoQ and  40  YoY   where a 13  sequential increase in patient starts could not offset eroding revenue yield per patient  This was consistent with our cautious views on this franchise  but occurred sooner and to a greater degree than we had anticipated 
In todays note  we use Gileads disclosure and commentary and updated IMS data to reestimate HCV product sales for the company for the remaining quarters of 2016  Our longer term forecast of steadily eroding HCV revenue is unchanged  We now forecast Gilead 2016 US HCV revenue of  8 7bn  5  less than our prior  9 2bn estimate  Our revised forecast reflects a 1 3  sequential compounded decline each quarter in realized revenue per start  and a 12  compounded decrease in revenue per Rx  the other approach we use to estimate quarterly sales   These declines are significantly less than the 23  QoQ decrease in realized revenue per start experienced in Q1  assuming that while some of the rebating and contract headwinds in Q1 don t persist in Q2  many others certainly will  Our adjusted total HCV revenue forecast for the company is now 2  above consensus for 2016 and 5  above consensus for 2017

201894,423410,GILD,Is Gilead Sciences Worth a Buy ,opinion,"A recent fifteen percent fall in most bio tech stocks  including bio tech giant Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  brings us a great opportunity to profit from 
The following is what has made me add Gilead Sciences to my medium term trading portfolio 
Please note  I am both a long term deep value investor as well as a medium term trader who utilizes the combination of both fundamental  technical and macro analysis to form a view of every investment I make  Doing so I believe leads to low risk and superior market beating returns over the long run 
Fundamental Factors The Bad

Earnings Per Share is forecasted to decline 
Interestingly this is primarily due to the remarkable success of two blockbuster Hepatitis C drugs  Sovaldi and Harvoni which had accounted for over 60  of Gilead s 2015 revenues  and its success in curing their patients has led to fewer patients therefore needing them in the future 
There is also the potential for future Government enforced price regulations of certain drugs due to political pressure  which then affects the whole bio tech industry 

The Good

Intrinsic valuation of  85  90  approx    so GILD is at fair value for a well managed growth company 
Priced at just seven times this year s and next year s earnings  which is cheap 
Earnings per share  EPS  have been great for the past 5 years 
Return on Equity  ROE  of over 80  is excellent but is unsustainable and is forecast to decline 
Long term cash flow relative to reported profits is strong 
Gilead has a long term funding surplus 
Massive cash pile of over  21 billion dollars  even after stock buyback to fund future growth 
Stock buyback likely to continue  even after an  8 billion buy back in the recent quarter 

Technical Factors The Bad

Recently broken below the  86 50 key price support level 
Currently below all 20  50 and 200 day moving averages 

The Good

The stock is oversold on a variety of momentum indicators 
Price is close to its 52 week low and seems to find key support at the  85 price level 

Other FactorsFor longer term investments and trades  I generally like to see who else is on board with me and where the smart money has found its home In my opinion  actions always speak louder than words  Gilead is held by a couple of smart money managers 

Ronald Muhlenkamp   6 63  of portfolio managed
Julian Robertson   5 15  of portfolio managed

ConclusionThe recent 15  price fall in Gilead Sciences has brought the stock back to fair value for a wonderfully managed bio tech company with smart money support 
I have just initiated a new position of Gilead Sciences for our medium term trading portfolio 
This is not the time to be fearful on such a great opportunity which has continued buying back their stock in big volumes at the right price  thus increasing its own intrinsic value over time ",2016-05-12,Terry Tran,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-gilead-sciences-(gild)-worth-a-buy-200129654,200129654

201912,423428,GILD,Earnings Watch  Can Gilead Maintain Streak ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   Healthcare   Biotechnology   Reports April 28  After Market Closes 
Key Takeaway 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share  3 23 on  8 21 billion in revenue  11 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom and  130 million on the top
Gilead s recent string of success can be attributed to the strength of its antiviral portfolio
Merck  NYSE MRK  recently launched a cheaper Hepatitis C drug which will put pressure Gilead s margins and sales 
Biopharmaceutical company  Gilead Sciences  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings after the market closes  Gilead has been a hot streak the past 2 fiscal years  beating in 7 of the past 8 reported quarters  Given its track record  it won t be surprising if Gilead posts another win with its Q1 results  The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share  3 23 on  8 21 billion in revenue  11 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom and  130 million on the top  Estimates have been on the move since its last report  Earnings per share estimates have increased 10  with revenue also up 4   Compared to a year earlier  profits are forecasted to rise 10  while sales could increase 8 
Strong earnings have not translated to the market  Gilead stock is down 3  from the prior year and 8  in the past 6 months alone  Fortunately  the stock moves in investors favor throughout earnings season  In the 30 days prior to earnings  shares typically increase 6  and continue to do so through the 30 days following results  
Over the last four quarters Gilead has posted positive earnings surprises of 5 9  on average  and is expected to beat again this Wednesday  Gilead is the market leader in Hepatitis C treatments  with two popular drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni  Their Hep C franchise  along with other antivirals  make up 90  of the company s revenue stream  However  the benefit of these drugs to the bottom line is waning as they have been on the market for a year and half now and are also curative  More competition is set to hit the Hep C market soon  with Merck recently approved to release its rival drug  Merck s treatment imposes a direct threat to Gilead especially since the drug is cheaper than Harvoni 
In order to diversify revenues  Gilead is focusing on growing other core offerings including HIV and Hep B treatments  Newly launched Zydelig  a treatment for three forms of cancer  is performing well and with a number of new drugs already FDA approved  this could lead to strong revenue growth in the near future  In addition to a solid product portfolio  Gilead possess a robust pipeline of potential products  Additional acquisitions and licensing agreements could help Gilead reach these goals

201915,423431,GILD,Shire  SHPG  Tops Q1 Earnings  Baxalta Buyout Set For June,opinion,"Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   reported first quarter 2016 earnings of  3 19 per American Depositary Share  ADS   up 12  year over year  and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 05 
Revenues surged 15  to  1 7 billion and came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Quarter in Detail
Product sales soared 14  to  1 6 billion driven by strong performance of Vyvanse  up 22  to  509 million   Lialda  up 13  to  168 million   Cinryze  up 11  to  164 million   Firazyr  up 39  to  128 million  and Gattex Revestive  up 97  on to  52 million  
Vyvanse is indicated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  ADHD  in patients aged six and above  as well as for moderate to severe binge eating disorder  B E D   in adults  The drug witnessed solid growth in the quarter driven by 10  prescription growth in the U S   which outpaced 7  growth in the ADHD market  Sales of Lialda were strong in the quarter driven by higher demand and price increase in January in the U S  Lialda exited the quarter with a 38 4  market share  representing an increase of more than 2  from 2015 end 
Sales were hurt as Intuniv sales  down 41  to  10 2 million  suffered due to generic competition  Elaprase and Vpriv sales were hampered by currency headwinds due to a strong dollar 
Royalty income surged 26  to  79 2 million  In the reported quarter  adjusted research   development costs were up 14 1  to  211 2 million  while selling  general   administrative expenses increased 13 9  to  439 2 million 
2016 Outlook
Shire continues to expect earnings per ADS to climb 7 10  in 2016  9 13  on a CER basis   The company expects product sales to surge 11 14   including Kalbitor   considering currency impact of 2 3 percentage points 
Shire expects royalties and other revenues to increase 5 10  in 2016 on the back of a benefit from the addition of royalties from Dyax as well as those related to Sensipar 
The full year guidance includes the impact of the recently completed Dyax acquisition  closed on Jan 22  2016   but excludes contributions from its recently announced merger with Baxalta  Inc    NYSE BXLT    which is expected to close in early June 
Pipeline Update
Shire submitted a New Drug Application  NDA  to the FDA for an alternate formulation of Vyvanse as a chewable tablet  Moreover  Shire announced positive top line results from a phase III trial on its ADHD candidate  SHP465  The study was conducted as per the FDA s requirement to evaluate its safety and efficacy in children and adolescents prior to filing a Class 2 resubmission for the drug s approval 
The company s efforts on building an ophthalmology portfolio got a boost when the FDA determined that the resubmission of company s New Drug Application  NDA  for its candidate  lifitegrast  was adequate and assigned a six month review period for the NDA  with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  date of Jul 22  2016 
Shire is also working on expanding Cinryze s label and conducting a phase III study for the treatment of acute antibody mediated rejection in renal transplant recipients  The company has initiated patient dosing in a phase III trial on the subcutaneous formulation of Cinryze for hereditary angioedema  HAE  attacks in both teenagers and adults  The Dyax acquisition is well on track and SHP643  which was added through the acquisition  has entered into clinical trials for the prophylactic treatment of HAE 
However  the company suffered a setback when preliminary results from a phase II study  CAMEO  on SHP625 for cholestatic liver disease showed no significant reduction from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase or other liver parameters  Shire plans to analyze data in detail to determine the path forward 
Our Take
Shire currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company s first quarter earnings exceeded expectations on the back of continued strength in Vyvanse  Lialda  Cinrzye and Firazyr  which more than offset the decline in Intuniv sales  Moreover  Shire has a solid presence in the gastrointestinal  neuroscience and rare disease markets 
The impending Baxalta acquisition will diversify its presence in the fields of hematology  immunology and oncology  The company also plans to expand in the transplantation space with maribavir for the treatment of CMV infection and Cinryze for the treatment of antibody mediated rejection 
Meanwhile  the adult ADHD space is one of the largest and fastest growing segments of the market and a potential approval of SHP465 will further strengthen Shire s franchise

Key Takeaway
This quarter the Estimize consensus is more bullish than Wall Street  calling for EPS of  3 06 and revenue of  8 18 billion
Gilead s recent string of success can be attributed to the strength of its antiviral portfolio
Merck  N MRK  recently launched a cheaper Hepatitis C drug which will put pressure on Gilead s margins and sales
What are you expecting for GILD  
Gilead Sciences  GILD  expects to close an impressive 2015 when it reports 4th quarter earnings February 2  after the bell  The past 4 quarters Gilead posted positive earnings surprises of 5 9  and is expected to beat again this Wednesday 
Gilead is the market leader in Hepatitis C treatment  which has largely contributed to the company s recent success  The drug is expected to strengthen its position and generate meaningful contributions to Gilead s Q4 top line despite increased competition 
This quarter the Estimize consensus is more bullish than Wall Street  calling for EPS of  3 06  8 cents above the Street s consensus  and revenue of  8 18 billion   73 million higher than the sell side  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY increase in EPS and revenue of 26  and 12   respectively  Besides improving its Hep C drug  Harvoni  Gilead is expected to grow its other core offerings including HIV and Hep B treatments 

Coming off a solid string of robust growth  Gilead continues to impress shareholders with a strong portfolio of antivirals  Its Hep C medicine  along with other antivirals account for over 90  of the company s revenue stream 
Fortunately  these drugs have performed well  but Gilead will be faced with roadblocks in the near future  Merck was recently approved to release its rival Hepatitis C drug  Merck s treatment imposes a direct threat to Gilead especially since the drug is cheaper than Harvoni  While Harvoni continues to post impressive sales  the drug is experiencing diminishing returns which will be impacted as competition intensifies 
With the emergence of Merck s new drug  Gilead would be wise to fine tune its other antiviral products outside of its Hep C drugs  Moreover  Gilead is expecting to encounter multiple obstacles in its robust pipeline  That said  pending drug approvals and potential takeovers will provide Gilead with a much needed boost to its top line and portfolio

So with that retracement under their belt  should biotechs be a place where investors start bargain hunting  Our simple answer is  No  
Is Biotech Cheap Now  Nope 
It s important to remember that biotech investing    outside the big cap biotechs such as Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  and Gilead  NASDAQ GILD     is simply not based on fundamentals  that is  on a careful and realistic assessment of risks and future earnings  XBI taken as a whole  for example  as of this writing has a price to earnings ratio of 988  based on the past 12 months of earnings    remarkably  there are in fact enough constituents of the index that actually have earnings to drag the average into positive territory   Another commonly used vehicle  the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  NASDAQ IBB   which is market capitalization weighted and thus heavier in companies that are actually profitable  comes in at a price to earnings ratio of 72  also based on the last 12 months of earnings   In short  even after a correction of over 60 percent  biotech is still very far from being cheap on a fundamental basis  Thus  it makes little sense to think of biotech as a  beaten down  sector    as if it were like other sectors or markets that have beaten down to a valuation below that supported by their fundamentals  Biotech would have a lot farther to fall before it would join that category 
 We are also skeptical about some of the valuation techniques used for fundamental analysis of biotech stocks which ascribe value based on the purported likelihood of the success of as yet unapproved new drugs  For example  an analyst might judge that a new drug could generate  100 million a year in earnings  and ascribe a 20 percent chance that the drug will be approved    and then factor  20 million in earnings into their model  However  even for capable analysts with doctoral level scientific education  estimating chances of success is at best a matter of educated guesses  And in the example given  the earnings will very likely not be  20 million  but zero or  100 million    a  binary event   So the share price targets that analysts come up with for development  and clinical stage biotech companies should be taken not just with a grain  but with a mountain of salt    or disregarded altogether  except insofar as they are clues as to what other investors are thinking  
What really matters for biotech investing    again  outside the big cap biotechs that have real earnings    is momentum and psychology  and if these are supportive  biotech can make sense for investors  Neither momentum nor psychology is now in play for biotech  If the U S  market does have another push past the old highs  it is not clear that biotechs will remain the anointed leaders of the rally    and as we have been observing since last year  the surrounding macro environment is not one that will support positive psychology for biotech 
Election Year Woes and the Pharma Biotech Whipping Boy
What is that environment  The election season  in which drug prices are a talking point for politicians of all stripes  and drug companies a political punching bag from right and left  Who is going to pass up the political hay that can be made by criticizing drug prices and calling for outright price controls or at the very least Medicare price negotiation  We think no one  The best that can be hoped is that if both nominees agree on the matter  they won t talk about it too much during the campaign  But frankly  that s not likely 
Investment implications   Biotech is down big from its peak last year  with some indices falling almost two thirds  and many stocks having fallen much more  However  that doesn t mean it s cheap  On a fundamental basis  biotechs are still very expensive    especially the small  and mid sized companies  Thus it makes no sense for investors to treat biotech as they would treat sectors or markets that have truly been beaten down below valuation levels supported by their fundamentals  Biotech stocks trade on momentum and psychology  momentum looks unlikely to return  particularly in the face of market psychology shaped by an election campaign in which it s  open season  on drug companies  Even established and profitable biotechs may well languish as the rest of the sector labors under this negative psychology  so for now  we think investors should not be tempted to dip their toes  After the Presidential election  when we know the attitude of the victor towards drug prices  we will know more  After legislation is implemented to cut prices  we will be better able to determine fair valuations for the participants in the industry ",2016-04-01,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/biotechs:-safe-to-get-in-the-water--not-so-fast-200123595,200123595
201943,423459,GILD,T2108 Update  October 2  2015    Oversold Period Ends And Leaves Behind,opinion," T2108 measures the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   It helps to identify extremes in market sentiment that are likely to reverse  To learn more about it  see my   You can  on twitter using the  T2108 hashtag  T2108 related trades and other trades are occasionally posted on twitter using   T2107 measures the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs 
T2108 Status  27 4 T2107 Status  20 2 VIX Status  20 9  closed on 50DMA General  Short term  Trading Call  Bullish  upside target of 1996 on the S P 500 before overbought conditions finally occur again  See    for more details  Active T2108 periods  Day  1 over 20   ends 4 day oversold period   Day  11 under 30   underperiod   Day  33 under 40   Day  93 under 50   Day  110 under 60   Day  315 under 70 
Commentary In   I came as close as I could to predicting an end to the oversold period  Only the uncertainty of the jobs report prevented me from making the direct prediction  As it turned out  the oversold period indeed ended on Friday  However  the process unfolded in a VERY surprising way 

T2108 ended the day at 27 4   T2108 started LOWER at 18 8  and sank from there as low as 16 2  as part of the fallout from the big miss on the jobs report  The selling ended almost as fast as it began  After about 40 minutes of consolidation  buyers took over for the rest of the day 

The S P 500  SPY  opened poorly in response to the jobs report but buyers quickly took over the trading action 


The end result was a VERY strong close that left Monday s selling  and the start of the oversold period  behind in the dust 
I am not even going to try to explain the sudden change in heart by the market  I WILL note that this surge of buying that reversed Monday s steep selling ends an important retest of August s lows  If buyers can follow through from here  the S P 500  SPY  may have laid the foundation for a double bottom  Getting through October  the last of the seasonally weak months  without further losses or yet another test will firm up this foundation 

Fortunately  I treated the plunge like a fresh drop into oversold territory and loaded up on a new tranche of call options on ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO   I was taken aback when I reviewed the position later in the day to find a 30  gain  I sold right away  At the close  I locked in my profits on the shares of ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  SVXY  that I bought at   This 4 day oversold period delivered yet another validation of the T2108 trading strategy  This time worked even better than the earlier two because it was a more typical run with a duration of 4 days 

The volatility index lost 7 1  on its way to a rest on its 50DMA  If the market pushes further away from oversold conditions  volatility could very quickly complete the reversal of the angst that erupted in Augst 

The volatility index is under pressure again 
The U S  dollar index also experienced a sharp reversal  but it continues to struggle with resistance at its 50DMA  A downtrend is looming overhead as well 

The U S  dollar index has essentially gone nowhere for almost all of 2015  The downtrend from the 12 year high set in March looms larger and larger now 
The dramatic bookends for the week   huge down day on Monday and huge reversal on Friday   helped to generate some very dramatic moves in individual stocks  I review a small sample below 

The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  gained 2 7  on the day and surged toward its 50DMA resistance again  My strangle play   out of the money call and put options   is now profitable on the call side  Ironically  this latest round would have been the first time in a very long time where I could have profited from BOTH sides of the trade 

iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  surges toward 50DMA resistance 
Buyers remain active on the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB  as a bottoming process looks more and more likely now  Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ GILD  reversed its big gap down but could barely close flat for the day  I am looking at GILD as a good  catch up  play     

Buyers on the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB  print a very strong follow through with a 3 5  gain on high volume 


The 15 minute chart on IBB shows the return of momentum for buyers  Monday s selling increasingly looks like final washout of panic 


Gilead Sciences Inc   GILD  gapped down and struggled just to close even on the day  It now lags the IBB recovery and looks like a good  catch up  play 
On the week  Solar City  SCTY  went from its lowest close since the Flash Crash   and a 2 year low   to a close above   Resistance still looms overhead with the 50DMA 

Solar City  SCTY  recovers from another severe bout of selling but now needs to beat overhead resistance 
SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK  is a GREAT example of the importance of closing out short positions during oversold conditions  I played SNDK puts off a retest of 50DMA resistance in mid September  I locked in profits on Monday  I was also motivated by the push of SNDK below its lower Bollinger Band  BB  

Sandisk  SNDK  is looking more bullish than it has looked in a very long time  Buyers step up bigtime 
Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM  made a classic  oversold  move by surging 8 5  on the mere rumor of merger and acquisition activity  This looks like a bottoming move given the surge off a retest of the intraday low in August  However  there is a LOT of damage to repair in WFM after two post earnings down gaps and a steep downtrend this year 

Whole Foods Market  WFM  shows a major sign of life 
Speaking of a major oversold market move  Wynn Resorts Ltd   WYNN  soared an incredible 23  after rumors of corporate welfare on the way from the Chinese government to prop up casinos in Macau  I can understand trying to prop up productive activities  but propping up a gambling industry  Something tells me some heavy politicking is at work on that one  I decided to fade this move with put options  Let s see whether the rumors prove to be false in the first place  If TRUE  clearly  there could be a LOT of upside left 

Wynn Resorts Ltd   WYNN  erases seven trading days of losses in a hurry 
Now for some balance  the news was not ALL good  My long term call options on Crocs  Inc   CROX  are pretty much toast  An earnings warning from CROX took the stock down bigtime including some serious follow through selling 

Crocs  CROX  is once again negative for 2015Daily T2108 vs the S P 500

201944,423460,GILD,Time To Buy Gilead ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  has been dealt an incredibly rough hand over the past three months  However  this great company isn t going to go down in flames  There have been a few issues driving the company downward that in my opinion  are going to be headed for an end relatively soon  Today  we ll talk about what these issues are  why GILD is one of the strongest investments in biotech  and what we can expect to see moving forward 
Issues That Brought Down GILD
There have been two major issues that have been dragging on the curtails of GILD  Here they are   

Market Wide Declines   Throughout the past several months  we ve seen rough times hit the US market  Unfortunately  high valuations  economic conditions around the world  and geopolitical uncertainties have all taken their toll on the United States market  Throughout this time  no stock has been safe  Just about every stock on the market has experienced the declines  including Gilead Sciences 
Hillary Clinton s Comments   Another major issue that hit GILD hard recently was comments made by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  Hillary Clinton announced that she has plans to end high prices in the medications for the treatment of chronically ill patients  Because Gilead Sciences is the leader in the treatment of hepatitis C  HCV  and focuses heavily on other chronic illnesses  these comments hit home for investors 

Neither Is Likely To Affect GILD In Long Run
While short term declines as a result of market wide resistance and presidential campaign comments are understandable  neither of these issues is likely to affect GILD in the long run  The reality is that the market goes through ups and downs  but the downs don t last very long  In regard to Hillary Clinton s comments  she ll need to will the presidential elections before she s able to effect such a large change  and I simply don t think that s going to happen 
Why GILD Is A Strong Investment Choice

Solid Products   First and foremost  any company is only as strong as its products  When it comes to Gilead Sciences  its product line is absolutely incredible  The company is the current leader in the treatment of HCV  Not to mention  they have been working diligently in the treatments of HIV  HBV  and more  All in all  GILD has proven their abilities with regard to creating effective treatments that take the market by storm 
Proof In The Pudding   While great products are nice to have  we ve learned from MannKind  NASDAQ MNKD  that just having a great product isn t enough  You need to be able to market that product  When it comes to GILD  the proof with regard to marketing ability is already there  They didn t become the leader in HCV for no reason 
Low Valuation   GILD was already trading with an incredibly low PE ratio  However  as a result of the declines we ve seen recently  that PE ratio has fallen even further  This presents an opportunity to get in on a strong stock at an incredible discount

201952,423468,GILD,Biotech Stocks To Watch  MNKD  AMRN  GILD,opinion,"MannKind Reports Earnings This Week
MannKind Corporation  NASDAQ MNKD 
MannKind has been one of my favorite stocks to watch  and this week is likely to prove to be a big week for the stock  The reality is that MannKind has been struggling in the market on a poor pre launch of Afrezza  However  that is likely to change  Tomorrow before the market opens  MannKind will be providing its earnings report for the quarter  While I don t think investors will care much about earnings  as we already know that they re not likely to be great  I think that this report may prove to be a catalyst  The reality is that MannKind recently announced that it had tripled its production capacity of Afrezza  With low sales volume  there s got to be a big reason for this move  one that I think is likely to be announced through the earnings report  So  keep your eyes peeled because this has the potential to be a major catalyst 
Amarin Could Have A Very Strong Week This Week
Amarin Corporation plc  ADR   NASDAQ AMRN 
Amarin Corporation had a great day in the market on Friday as a court ruling sent the stock skyrocketing  The case was between Amarin and the FDA in a fight for the disclosure of unapproved affects of Vascepa to physicians  The court ruled that Amarin may disclose unapproved benefits of Vascepa to physicians  leading to a gain of more than 14  in the market  Here s what John F  Thero  CEO of AMRN had to say following the court ruling 

 This lawsuit is based on the principle that better informed physicians will make better treatment decisions for their patients  Many physicians are aware of the efficacy data including in FDA approved labeling for Vascepa but are not aware of efficacy data from the ANCHOR study of Vascepa  FDA has already announced the safety data from both the MARINE and ANCHOR studies in approved Vascepa labeling  Amarin will now be able to communicate efficacy data from ANCHOR and other relevant study results to these physicians and to others in the medical community in the context of appropriate disclaimers  

Considering the reason for the climb  I don t think we ve seen the end of it  So  keep a close eye on AMRN throughout the week for opportunities 
Gilead Sciences  GILD  Is Likely To See Strong Growth
Gilead Sciences  Inc   NASDAQ GILD 
Finally  we have Gilead Sciences  In my opinion  GILD is one of the strongest stocks in biotech  and for good reason  Even in the face of strong competition  the company has proven its ability to maintain control over the HCV market and recently  they ve been given a credit rating of A   However  we saw declines in the stock on Thursday that have brought it down to support followed by relatively flat movement on Friday  Therefore  I m expecting to see strong gains from GILD throughout the week ",2015-08-10,Joshua Rodriguez,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/biotech-stocks-to-watch-this-week:-mannkind-(mnkd),-amarin-(amrn),-gilea-261057",261057

201954,423470,GILD,Take A Look At Gilead Sciences,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD 
I ve been covering Gilead Sciences for quite some time now  and I m proud that through the ups and downs  I ve maintained my bullish opinion on the stock  The reality is that GILD has one of the most interesting success stories in biotechnology today  and the story keeps getting better  Here s why you may be missing out on an opportunity if this stock is not in your portfolio 
Gilead Sciences Has An Impressive History
First and foremost  Gilead Sciences has an incredible track record  Starting with the hepatitis C market  the company pretty much controls it  Although concerns started to rise earlier this year about GILD s ability to maintain control of the HCV market as AbbVie stepped in  the company proved that they have a stronghold on the market 
It s also important to look at GILD s earnings history  The bottom line is that this company has a strong history of producing incredible earnings reports  According to Street Insider  Gilead Sciences has produced earnings above analyst expectations for 7 out of the last 8 quarters  including the past 3 consecutive quarters  The only miss in the bunch wasn t missed by much 
GILD Is Heavily Undervalued
Another metric I like to pay attention to when choosing stocks to cover is valuation  and when it comes to GILD their valuation is pristine  The reality is that in today s market  it can be difficult to find a stock that isn t overvalued  meaning that good value for your money is hard to come by  However  Gilead Sciences is great in that respect  Currently  a PE ratio under 17 is great  Now  try a PE ratio under 10  According to NASDAQ  Gilead s price to earnings is only 8 55  about half of what investors should be looking for  That insinuates incredible upside potential and one heck of an opportunity 
More Good News Continues To Pop Up
Gilead Sciences also has a knack for producing positive news time and time again  and since news has a tendency of causing moves in the market  that s great for investors  Most recently  the company announced data from it s AMBITION study  AMBITION is a collaboration between GILD and GSK  The study is looking into a combined therapy that combines Letairis and tadalafil in an attempt to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension  New data from the AMBITION study shows that the combined treatment reduced the risk of clinical failure by 50  when compared to Letairis and tadalafil monotherapy  Following the announcement of data  University of California s Emeritus Professor  Lewis J  Rubin  MD   had the following to say 
 The only other published  large scale  event driven study to date in PAH compared an endothelin receptor antagonist to placebo in patients who were either treatment naive or on background therapy  however  all patients in AMBITION received an approved therapy for PAH  Thus  the magnitude of the effect with this combination in comparison to active monotherapy is impressive  particularly in WHO functional calss II patients were we observed nearly an 80 percent reduction in the risk of clinical failure versus monotherapy  
The Bottom Line
The bottom line is that GILD is a great stock  The company has a stronghold on the HCV market  is incredibly effective in the HIV market and is continually finding new medical ailments to tackle  Combining the company s successes with an incredibly low valuation makes this an incredibly strong buy ",2015-08-28,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gilead-sciences-(gild)-stock:-don’t-miss-this-opportunity-263262,263262

Ariad Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ARIA    Baxalta Inc  NYSE BXLT 
One of the biggest conversations in the biotech space has been a discussion with regard to whether or not Baxalta will acquire Ariad Pharmaceuticals  The original offer on the table was  2 billion  However  Ariad Pharmaceuticals declined the offer   and rightfully so  The premium offered was far below what the average expected premium is in the biotech space  However  the company is still in the midst of negotiations  Personally  I would love to see this acquisition happen  but I m not sure it will  Nonetheless  only time will tell what happens next 
Twitter  NYSE TWTR  Investors Await Management News
Twitter Inc  NYSE  TWTR 
Twitter is having a rough day in the market today  However  the declines are likely caused by the market wide declines that we re seeing today  Nonetheless  there is one big piece of news out of Twitter that s expected to surface any time now  The company has been working to find a new CEO for quite some time now after the previous CEO resigned due to his failure to pick up user data  Rumors are surfacing that Jack Dorsey is likely to take the long term position  which I think would be great  Nonetheless  no one knows who will take the position just yet  When the decision is made  we can expect it to act as a positive catalyst  and many experts are expecting this to happen on or around Labor Day  which is less than a week away  So  watch closely as opportunity is likely on its way 
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  Short Interest Is Up
Gilead Sciences  Inc   NASDAQ  GILD 
Gilead Sciences is having a rough day in the market as well  however  their declines are beyond current market conditions  Unfortunately  short interest spiked by 16  in the month of August  showing that investors are expecting to see more declines to come  Nonetheless  I still believe that GILD is a great company  They have taken control of the HCV market and maintained that control in the face of strong competition  They are also a major player in the HIV market and are continuing to innovate in the world of medicine  With that said  I think that the short interest has quite a bit to do with overall opinions of the market and  when the market settles  so too will this issue for GILD investors  Nonetheless  expect declines here and there as turbulence continues

MannKind is having an incredible day in the market today  As market turmoil starts to subside  the stock is climbing  currently  2 15  trading at  4 00 per share after a gain of 3 09  so far  While we re likely to see a slight correction bringing the stock down tomorrow  I think that it may finally be time for MNKD to start seeing some real gains  The reality is that concerns about Afrezza are starting to subside  The Direct to Consumer phase is in full swing at the moment and insurers are starting to pick up coverage on the medication  As a result MNKD are likely to see sales climb relatively soon  leading to profits for the company and gains for its stock  With that said  tomorrow we are likely to see dips  In my opinion  buying the dips is likely to prove to be a strong strategy on this stock 
Nanosphere Receives FDA Clearance
Nanosphere  Inc   NASDAQ NSPH 
Nanosphere is having an incredible day in the market today after announcing that they have received 510 k  clearance from the FDA  The clearance surrounds RP Flex  the first test of its kind  The new test features Nanosphere s novelFlex software  a software that allows the 16 viral and bacterial targets identified by RP Flex to be reported as a full multiplex panel or in various user defined subsets  This flexible panel concept addresses varied respiratory testing needs of labs and clinicians with a single comprehensive and cost effective solution  In the RP Flex testing  labs will only be required to pay for the targets that are ordered  ultimately driving down the cost of healthcare  Here s what Paul Granato  Ph D   had to say during the announcement 

 The demand and need for respiratory pathogen testing varies by season  geography  epidemiology and patient demographics  RPFlex is the first respiratory test that provides labs with the flexibility to choose and pay for only the microbial targets applicable to a given patient  which in turn allows them to practice better test stewardship and reduec healthcare costs  

Following the news  NSPH climbed in a big way  Currently  2 23   the stock is trading at  3 00 per share after a gain of 11 11  so far today 
Gilead Sciences Presents A Great Buying Opportunity
Gilead Sciences  Inc   NASDAQ GILD 
Gilead Sciences  in my opinion  is one of the strongest stocks in biotech  After all  the company has complete control over the hepatitis C treatment space  plays a major role in the treatment of HIV and continues to innovate  Another thing that s worth mentioning is that the stock has an incredibly low PE ratio  which means that the stock is incredibly undervalued  On top of the low PE ratio  market wide declines have brought the stock even further down  which is creating quite the buying opportunity  Currently  2 26   GILD is trading at  104 21 per share after a gain of 2 15  so far today  However  don t expect this low price to last  Gains are on their way

201958,423474,GILD,Gilead Sciences Belongs In Your Portfolio,opinion,"In my opinion  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  is likely the strongest biotech stock on the market today  They have an incredible story and are offering an even more incredible opportunity  The bottom line here is that GILD is going to grow  and in a big way  Today  we ll talk about why I m so bullish on Gilead Sciences and the opportunity the stock is presenting for investors  So  let s get right to it   
Why My Opinion Of GILD Is A Very Bullish One
Gilead Sciences provides many reasons to be bullish on their stock  To name a few   

Dominance In HCV   First and foremost  Gilead Sciences plays an incredibly dominant role in the hepatitis C treatment arena  Their treatment  Harvoni is currently the leader in the United States  and that s not likely to change any time soon  In fact  even in the face of stiff competition  GILD has maintained their dominant position in the market 
Continued HCV Innovation   While Gilead Sciences is already dominant in the HCV market  that doesn t mean that they ve put an end to innovation  Ultimately  the company wants to continue producing better and better treatments for the ailment  This was proven in their most recent data release  The company released top line results from four studies looking into a new HCV combination drug  The new combination drug relieves the need of phenotype testing in HCV patients  Essentially  it is proving to treat all phenotypes 
Gaining Ground In Other Indications   While Gilead Sciences maintains a stronghold on the hepatitis C market  it is also gaining ground in other areas  The company has promising candidates in both hepatitis B and in HIV 

The Incredible Opportunity GILD Presents
As if the information listed above wasn t enough to get excited about GILD and its potential to grow  the stock is offering quite the opportunity  Currently  GILD is oversold and undervalued  Early in the year  AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  released a hepatitis C drug that would compete with Gilead s  As a result  investors got cold feet and were afraid to push the stock up  Nonetheless  GILD continued to produce incredible earnings  As a result  the PE ratio on the stock fell to below 10 and is still there currently 
More recently  Hillary Clinton made comments that she plans to submit a bill that will reduce the cost of prescription medication for chronically ill patients dramatically  Unfortunately  this would affect the company s bottom line if it happened  However  I don t think that s going to happen  Clinton would have to make it to office before she could submit such a bill  and that would take a miracle at this point thanks to her email scandal 
Nonetheless  the stock declined following Hillary Clinton s statements  bringing it s PMI to 29 5  Anything under 30 shows excessive fear and oversold conditions  It s when great companies meet these conditions that the most hefty discounts are available for investors  and that s exactly the case with GILD

Anacor Pharmaceuticals Stock Climbs On Data Release
Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ANAC 
Anacor Pharmaceuticals is up in a big way today after announcing preliminary top line results from two Phase 3 studies of Crisoborole Topical Ointment  The ointment is a novel non steroid anti inflammatory phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor  It is an experimental treatment designed to treat mid to moderate atopic dermatitis in both children and andults  The data released shows that the studies have both achieved statistically significant results in all endpoints  both primary and secondary  The study also demonstrated a safety profile that is consistent with previous studies  As a result  ANAC is soaring in the market today  currently  12 07  trading at  46 74 per share after a massive gain of 55 24   In a statement  Paul L  Berns  CEO of Anacor Pharmaceuticals had the following to say 

 We are extremely pleased by the top line results from our Phase 3 pivotal studies of crisaborole  We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for a novel non steroid topical anti inflammatory treatment option for the patients who are affected by mild to moderate atopic dermatitis  We also want to extend a special thanks to the clinical investigators who conducted the studies and the patients and their families who volunteered to participate in our studies  We currently plan to file a New Drug Application for crisoborole in the first half of 2016 and  if approved  we believe crisaborole could offer an important treatment option for patients with mid to moderate atopic dermatitis  

Given the reason for the climb today  I don t see any long term downtrends in the near future for ANAC  While we are likely to see a correction after massive gains  I think the overall trend is going to be relatively bullish  So  watch for pull backs as your opportunity to get in on the gains 
MannKind Corporation Is Up As investors Anticipate D2C Phase
MannKind Corporation  NASDAQ MNKD 
MannKind Corporation is having a strong day in the market today as investors anticipate the Direct to Consumer phase for Afrezza  We know that this is just around the corner  However  an exact date hasn t been provided quite yet  However  insider buying shows that it may be closer than we think  It was recently disclosed that the COO of MNKD purchased 20 000 shares in the company at a value of  91 400  Insider buys insinuate confidence from insiders that the stock will grow  and with the Direct to Consumer phase coming soon  there s no reason to think any different  So  keep a close eye on this one as we re likely to see big movement very soon 
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  Continues To Climb On Rights To Sell In Japan
Gilead Sciences  Inc 
If you ve followed CNA Finance or my writing just about anywhere else  you know that I m a big fan of Gilead Sciences  The reality is that thanks to uncertainty revolving around competition in the HCV market  the company s stock has been kept at a relatively low price  even when earnings justified growth  However  it seems like GILD is going to see the growth it deserves moving forward  Last week  the company announced that it had received regulatory approval for the sale of Harvoni in Japan  a massive HCV market  As a result  investors have reacted in an overwhelmingly positive way  pushing the stock up  Considering the low valuation on the stock and massive upside potential  I don t see any major downtrends in Gilead s near future  So  keep your eye out for dips as they will likely prove to be incredibly profitable times to buy 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Is Likely To See Big Gains Soon
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ SGYP 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals has been one of my favorite stocks in biotech to watch recently  The reason revolves around the company s experimental drug known as plecanatide  Last week  the company brought a new member to the board for the commercialization of the drug  showing that a New Drug Application with the FDA isn t far off  Generally  when NDAs are submitted  they prove to be catalysts for the stock  and I m not expecting anything different in this case  So  this is another one to watch closely as its likely to present a strong opportunity for gains

201969,423485,GILD,5 Stocks To Watch,opinion,"Gilead Sciences
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  reports its FQ2  15 results on Tuesday after the market close  Both Estimize and Wall Street are predicting a fall in EPS and revenues QoQ  Estimize are forecasting an EPS figure of  2 78 and a revenue target of  7 570B  Wall Street estimates EPS to come in at  2 64 and revenues to be  7 360B 

The success of Gilead over the past 36 months can be attributed to the company s strong revenue growth figures which have blown expectations out of the water consistently over the past 2 years  However  this metric has recently experienced a slowdown and is expected to only further decline  As payers begin to balk at the high price tags of Gilead s Hepatitis C drugs including Sovaldi and Harvoni  sales are expected to be negatively affected 
Despite the potential negatives associated with falling revenue growth  Gilead is in a very strong position in terms of its balance sheet  Gilead has the ability to use its balance sheet to its advantage and potentially acquire desirable businesses in an attempt to bolster growth over the coming years 
Investors will be eager to hear from management with respect to both increasing competition and also their M A strategy moving forward  Investors have become accustomed to Gilead outperforming analyst expectations  therefore if there is a miss on Tuesday  the stock could potentially experience a significant pull back depending on the severity 
Ford Motor Co 
Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  will report its FQ2  15 results before the opening bell on Tuesday and both Estimize and Wall Street are predicting an uptick in revenues and EPS QoQ  The struggles have continued YTD for the car manufacturer with the company posting a negative capital return of  7 16   For FQ2  15  the Estimize community predicts an EPS value of  0 36  just one cent above Wall Street s estimate of  0 35  Dissimilar to EPS  Wall Street actually predict a higher revenue figure of  35 925B compared to Estimize s forecast of  35 886B 

Ford Motors are currently in the process of deploying a substantial amount of capital across the globe in an attempt to expand and boost top line revenue growth  Despite the expected positives associated with its global expansion  Ford is under pressure for a number of reasons including enhanced competition restricting margin expansion  a devalued Russian currency hurting USD denominated earnings  and a weak Eurozone economy continues to hurt sales in the region

201970,423486,GILD,Thoughts From Collins Place,opinion," Stability  is working
China almost crossed the line back into the black yesterday and expectations are that the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets will actually register positive prints today  It s a bold call but one I think will be proven right 
It would be remiss to not to point out how much China drove trade yesterday 
Chinese futures plunged at 11 15am AEST on the open  which spooked Asian markets almost immediately 
On the open of the cash markets  however  everything rallied  Japan  Southeast Asia  Australia  Hong Kong and mainland China rallied from 11 30am onwards and did so all the way to the final hour of Chinese trading 
Call it what you will  the aptly named  rescue squad  have made their intentions clear and will continue to support the Chinese markets at any cost 
Yes  the Chinese indices closed down however  strength is seen in the 200 day moving average and further investigations into Monday s price plunge will limit major downswings for the next few weeks 
I have been asking myself this question recently  what effect have the last two months of equity market trade had on the Chinese economy and consumer  The economy is yet to release its retrospective information  August will illustrate how the markets affected the economy  but Chinese consumer numbers are out 
So  is the equity crash having an effect on Chinese consumers  In short  no  The loss of wealth from the collapse of the markets is not hitting the majority of Chinese wealth  Chinese household saving rates are currently the highest in the world at 40   Its nearest rival is Luxembourg at a touch over 10   The China stock market crash is an interesting situation however the net effect on the Chinese people looks minimal at this point 
What else is spiking my interest
US earnings season kicked back into gear   Twitter  NYSE TWTR  is the likely standout on the open with a huge beat on the EPS line  The same can be said for Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   The hepatitis drug maker has certainly justified the market excitement it has seen in the past six to twelve months and may see solid buying on the open tomorrow 
However  there is a growing sense the US bull market is out of breath  The six and a half year Bull Run in the US is showing signs of fatigue  Here s why 
Only 34  of US stocks are above their 200 day moving average 
Only 54  of stocks are above their 50 day average this year  compared to 64  in 2014 and 73  in 2013  yes  the momentum has been slowing for two years  
Healthcare and consumer discretionary sectors account for all gains in the S P 500 this year  every other sector is in the red 
The transport sector is trading at its largest discount to the market in two years 
57  of S P companies are in a correction  contracted 10  or more  
460 stocks on the NYSE are at 52 week lows 
Yet the S P is up over 3  year to date 
Iron ore is now bouncing   53 45 is the highest level in almost a month  However  both Brazil and Australia have cut export volumes in July as maintenance at terminals kicks in  The longer term outlook shows the taps will be turned back on once July maintenance filters out  I see iron ore averaging US 50 tonne for the remainder of the year 
Ahead of the Australian open
The bounce in the equites and commodities markets overnight should give a pretty positive lead to markets  However  the jump in iron ore was foreshadowed in the Dalian futures market yesterday and the jump in miners may be slightly muted as it might have been priced in yesterday 
There is an interesting pattern emerging in the S P ASX 200  having seen the ASX breaking out of the downtrend from the April top to the June low  The top of the channel has been defended three times in the past week and looks to be a new support level 
This is despite the issues facing China and the weak leads from the States  5550 sees a reasonable amount of buying support and the ASX will cross back into 5600 points today  meaning July will be the first positive trading month for the ASX since February as it would be hard for the market to fall over 150 points in the next two days 
Ahead of the open  the ASX is pointing down 43 points to 5628

202022,423538,GILD,Reworking Our Healthcare ETFs,opinion,"My colleague Matthew McAleer and I have examined a transaction that may have altered the valuations of some of our health care positions 
AbbVie Inc  launched a new drug to treat hepatitis C  The other competitor in the hepatitis C treatment space is Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ GILD   Recently  a major pharmaceutical distribution company  Express Scripts Holding Company  NASDAQ ESRX  made a contractual offer to AbbVie for its hepatitis C drug  with a discounted pricing structure 
Here is the issue  Gilead occupied the space  had the treatment  and was the dominant player in the hepatitis C drug treatment arena  AbbVie came in with a competitive product at roughly the same pricing  It was not disruptive with regard to its pricing model  but it presented buyers of these products with two choices  Express Scripts was using Gilead  but they cut a new pricing deal at a discounted rate with AbbVie as a sole source  We do not know what the discount rate is 
The takeaway from this anecdotal event is that pharmaceutical pricing is under pressure  The fact that we have seen one such deal suggests there may be more  Translate that to stock market and ETF strategies  and we can see where this might be going 
Health care ETFs depend on the underlying performance of their component stocks  and those stocks depend on two elements  The first is pricing power  the ability to maintain profit margins on many different components and chemical constructions and approved treatments  Some of these are very highly priced and must now be considered vulnerable 
The second element is that some pharmaceutical companies derive a large fraction of their earnings abroad and face currency translations that could be less than robust due to the strength of the dollar  The combination of the two elements creates some additional risk to earnings and profit margins in this sector 
Cumberland Advisors  response in our US ETF portfolio was to immediately sell  NYSE XPH   SPDR Pharmaceuticals ETF  and  ARCA XLV   Health Care Select Sector SPDR   We are now underweight the health care sector as we watch pricing pressures unfold  We enter 2015 concerned about a sector that had previously delivered stellar stock market returns

202023,423539,GILD,2014 Ends On A High  Bring On 2015,opinion,"As 2014 winds to a close  the year has been interesting for all kinds of reasons  Clearly the most unexpected development in financial markets was the unexpected fall in the price of oil over the back half of the year  Very few prognosticators predicted such an event  let alone those rare birds who actually profited from the rapid market decline of it s various grades  WTI  Brent   Many believed interest rates would finally rise  but this has proved the widow maker trade for those who took the bait  Over the last five years  investors have constantly bet the yield on treasury bonds would gain  especially the ten year duration  Nope  The current rate  2 25   No winners there 
In the equity markets  investors grappled with the threat of a less accommodative Federal Reserve with the ending of QE forever  Much was made of the threat that interest rates would head higher and stocks should fall  Again  nope  Every time equities sold off  it presented a buying opportunity  but only in specific sectors or issues which continued to outperform  From a macroeconomic perspective  the economy picked up steam after a tough first quarter  which has to be attributed to very poor weather  Even better  the price decline of oil has given the average household a shot in the arm with a few extra bucks in their pockets  As consumer spending accounts for such a heavy percentage of the economy  it was not surprising to see third quarter GDP come in at 5   the highest number in 11 years  Clearly  those who thought the economy was poised for persistent stagflation have been in error  I would feel for them  but the negative nabobs of negativity have only provided a constant opportunity over the last five years  Indeed  if you would have listened to them in 2009  and since then  you have missed out on one of the great equity markets of all time  Still  no victory laps for investors as the biggest question now becomes  what will happen in 2015 



Before we think about trying to predict the unpredictable  let s take a look at last weeks major events  In the health care space  Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  signed a deal with AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  to try and displace Gilead  NASDAQ GILD  in the Hepatitis C drug market  Investors saw the deal as a paradigm shift in the biotechnology space  so all the leading performers sold off hard on the thesis the drug providers will no longer have pricing power  Russia s currency stabilized  with some  ahem  help  from the Putin government as it twisted it s bankers arms into helping protect the roughed up ruble  China helped out as well by providing a 24 billion dollar  3 year currency swap  ruble yuan  to assist it s largest trading partner  Do you think the fact that China has committed to buying oil and gas from Russia for the next 20 years has anything to do with the currency swap  No  of course not 



Elsewhere  Christmas came and went and the final week of the holiday shopping season brought out all kinds of estimates as to the relative robustness of retailers results  My own opinion is sellers probably did better than most believe as the crowds I saw in the malls were as large as I have ever witnessed  When you combine lower gas prices  falling unemployment rates  and plenty of holiday specials  both online and off  the urge to spurge dominated most people s thinking at this festive time 



Turning towards 2015  the weekly edition of Barron s gives us a clue on what to expect for the new year  You see  2014 was a year when S P 500 companies spent nearly one Trillion dollars on stock buybacks and dividends for their shareholders  up 24  from 2013  One Trillion  The magnitude of the number is significant because it shows you the earnings power of the largest companies in the world  When enterprises are shrinking the float of outstanding shares year after year  and also rewarding shareholders with increasing payouts  let s just say you want to be a participant in these activities  Will the market post another double digit gain next year  Who knows  and you don t want to base decisions on one statistic  but just remember  one trillion  with a t

202032,423548,GILD,The Wonder Drug That Will Quadruple Gilead s 3rd Quarter Profits,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   is set to report earnings for its 3rd quarter of 2014 after the market closes on Tuesday October 28  At the beginning of this year GIlead began selling its new treatment for Hepatitis C  Sovaldi  in one of the most successful drug launches of all time 
In the first 6 months of the year alone Gilead sold over  5 billion worth of Sovaldi  making it the fastest drug to ever reach blockbuster sales status  more than  1 billion   It s on such a trajectory that it could even become the top selling medication of the year in its first year available 
Sovaldi sells for  1000 a pill and helped push Gilead to a colossal earnings beat last quarter  After the close today analysts will be looking to see a strong follow through from Sovaldi  but will also be eager to hear from management about the progress of Gilead s second generation Hepatitis C drug  Harvoni 


Harvoni is a medication that combines Sovaldi with ledipasvir  another drug made by Gilead  Like Sovaldi  Harvoni does not come cheap  A 12 week treatment program runs about  95 000  That s slightly more than the cost of Sovaldi over the same period  but Sovaldi can not used independently  Harvoni provides a cheaper combined treatment than the options which previously existed for Sovaldi 
Gilead just won an FDA approval to sell Harvoni earlier this month  so it won t show up in Q3 earnings  But investors will be looking to management to give a projection on Harvoni and estimate how successful they believe the new substance will be  In the meantime  Sovaldi should have plenty of wind in its sails to carry the company through 3rd quarter earnings 

According to the World Health Organization  roughly 3  of the world s population is living with the Hepatitis C infection  That s why it s no surprise that Sovaldi has been so successful  Last quarter there was a large range of estimates for Gilead on Estimize  signaling uncertainty among investors  Gilead came out and ripped the cover off the ball reporting earnings of  2 36 per share compared to the Estimize consensus of  1 94 while Wall Street was forecasting  1 80 

For the third quarter we are seeing an even larger range of estimates as displayed by the blue box above  That means that investors disagree about whether or not Sovaldi can continue pushing Gilead s earnings higher or if profits will stumble 
One of the interesting things about Gilead is that before the launch of its Hepatisis C drugs revenue growth was hovering around 15  on a year over year basis  On its 2 most recent quarters the pharmaceutical company recorded sales growth of 97  and 146  respectively  This quarter contributing analysts on Estimize except Gilead to up the pace and increase sales by a staggering 159  compared to the same quarter of last year 
Before the launch of Sovaldi profits at Gilead were stable near 50 cents per share each quarter  Since the launch of Sovaldi at the start of the year those numbers have been launched into orbit  This quarter the Estimize community has come to a consensus expectation for Gilead to come 1 penny shy of quadrupling its earnings from the third quarter of last year 
Much like Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  which also reports after the close today  Gilead Sciences is a hot stock with sky high expectations to live up to  Sovaldi should net the company huge profits this quarter  and we should learn from management what type of impact to expect from Harvoni over the next 3 months ",2014-10-28,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-wonder-drug-that-will-quadruple-gilead’s-3rd-quarter-profits-230515,230515
202040,423556,GILD,Casting A Wary Eye On Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc ,opinion,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ICPT  may indeed have the  5B blockbluster liver drug that  in hiking its price target on the stock from  425 to  500  Gilead  Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD     Other analysts like Leerink Partners who raised its price target from  270 to  445  and Deutsche Bank  which raised its price target from  395 to  500  may end up being correct 
But on the day after  and announced   the stock experienced a massive fade from the initial euphoria  Moreover  the the initial pop still placed the stock well below the highs of January s amazing euphoria  That euphoria took the stock to and past current price targets  It is like the adrenaline shots are losing their impact 

A wild ride for ICPT
Yesterday  August 12  2014  ICPT gapped up 46  but faded to end the day with  only  a 16 6  gain  If the ICPT story is still golden  there is certainly an amazing upside potential still left here  But the caution of a wary technician has me skeptical 
It is almost never a good sign when a stock sells off and or fades despite unbridled  headline  enthusiasm  Moreover  if the risk of failure has now decreased in ICPT as RBC claims  from 40 to 30  chance of failure   then it seems odd that the stock is trading so far off the initial enthusiasm in January  much less unable to hold today s highs  Contrast today s behavior with January s ability to hold most of the gains from the open AND plow even more buying power into the stock the very next day  both times well above the upper Bollinger  Band  overbought territory  
The failure in March to make new highs  followed by a 1 month loss of 50   followed by churn with a bias lower  finally followed by a  gap and crap  all makes for a high likelihood of buyer exhaustion  The first test comes right away  Buyers must be able to keep the gap from closing and re establish momentum  Otherwise  a resumption of the previous drift lower is in play 
Short interest also caught my eye  The ICPT bears clearly called the stock disastrously wrong as they ramped up positions going into January s announcement  In subsequent months  shares short gradually got cut in half as bears licked their wounds  But oddly enough   as if they could not get enough   bears went right back to work and ramped up positions to fresh highs before pulling back a bit ahead of today s news 

Are these stubborn bears just reckless or are they onto something  
The large swings in ICPT are a trader s dream  whether bullish or bearish  The well behaved technical patterns also provide strong trading potential  For example  note how the break below the 50 day moving average  DMA  confirmed the large swoon the week prior that created a failed retest of all time highs  A classic bearish 1 2 combo  I wish I had been paying attention at the time  The bulls got some relief after ICPT retested the lows from January s pop multiple times and each time bounced until July  After THAT failure  the 200DMA held up support  So while I think bears now hold the upper hand again  they still have a lot to prove when  if   ICPT eventually retests these support levels 
I am definitely not one to short this stock  I do not have that kind of capital to put at risk  I prefer options  The bid ask spread on options are understandably wide  so it may not even be possible to trade this stock  safely  and at a reasonable price  If I could play options  I would go for a spread in order to eliminate a lot of the premium paid for the stock s extremely high  implied  volatility  I would go for something like a  210 200 or  220 200   200 appears to be a reasonable first target if buyer exhaustion eventually leads to a break of current support levels  Bulls looking for new entry points should at least wait to see whether they can get a better deal on a 50DMA retest around  245

202041,423557,GILD,Why Gilead Is The Most Exciting Growth Opportunity In 2014 ,opinion,"Introduction
Earnings drive stock price in the long run and Gilead Sciences Inc  Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD   is entering a remarkable period of what could only be called astounding future earnings growth   This has not gone unnoticed by the market  as the stock price has been on a steady ascent for the past several months  
With this article I will offer a comprehensive fundamental review that I believe supports my view that in spite of its recent price run up  Gilead remains a reasonably valued and exciting opportunity for those investors seeking maximum capital appreciation    However  I will qualify this position by stating that my view is long term   In other words  there is always the possibility that current price may retreat over the short run   But  in the long run earnings determine market price and I believe the future earnings potential of Gilead is clear and well defined 
Short Company Description
The following short business description on Gilead Sciences Inc provided courtesy of S P Capital IQ 
 Gilead Sciences  Inc   a research based biopharmaceutical company  is engaged in the discovery  development  and commercialization of medicines in areas of unmet medical need  The company has operations in North and South America  Europe and Asia Pacific  The company s primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B virus  HBV  infection and chronic hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection  oncology inflammation and serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions   In the liver diseases area  the company received approval from the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  of new drug application  NDA  for Sovaldi  sofosbuvir 400 mg   Sovaldi is a once daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of HCV infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen  The company also received approval of Tybost  cobicistat  and Vitekta  elvitegravir 85 mg and 150 mg   each a component of Stribild  from the European Commission  In the oncology inflammation area  the company filed for FDA and European Medicines Agency  EMA  marketing approval of idelalisib  formerly GS 1101   an investigational  targeted  oral inhibitor of PI3K delta  for the treatment of patients with refractory indolent non Hodgkin s lymphoma  iNHL  and relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL   The company also continued to advanced research and development pipeline  with approximately 200 active clinical studies in 2013  of which approximately 60 were in Phase 3 clinical trials  
Earnings Operating History
Up through 2013 Gilead was a consistently fast growing biotechnology company averaging 42 9  per annum earnings growth   However  as the following graph reveals  earnings growth had significantly slowed down since 2011   This simultaneously led to a very low valuation   On the other hand  the company s stock price went on a rapid ascent in 2013  perhaps in anticipation of what was soon to come 

The following earnings only FAST Graphs  on Gilead Sciences Inc illustrate the dynamic nature of a company s earnings per share growth over different time periods   Earnings growth is a dynamic calculation that varies when graphed from one timeframe to the next   Consequently  it s important to review several timeframes when evaluating a company s historical earnings growth rate   The following 15 calendar year  10 calendar year  7 calendar year and 5 calendar year graphs illustrate that although Gilead s earnings growth has been consistently high over the years  it became explosive for 2014 and beyond  see earnings growth rates circled in yellow    Note  growth rates include all estimates on the graph whether calendar or fiscal year

Current 10 Year Earnings and Price Correlated FAST Graph  with Normal P E Ratio 

The key takeaway from the above earnings and price correlated graphs is that Gilead s quantum leap in earnings growth has not yet been fully credited by the market   Consequently  based on earnings expectations the stock appears to represent a compelling long term investment 
15 Year Historical P E Ratio Trend
The dark blue line reflects the fiscal year end P E ratio for Gilead Sciences Inc since 2008  the right scale on the graph    Clearly we see that Gilead s P E Ratio had been consistently dropping due to lower than average earnings growth  and then began rising again in 2012 and 2013   However  the current explosion in earnings growth has once again brought the P E Ratio on Gilead back into attractive valuation levels  

Performance
Historical performance is functionally related to earnings growth achievement and starting valuation   Consequently  when performance is properly measured  it is imperative that starting valuation be considered in conjunction with earnings  and dividends  if any  growth 
A high beginning valuation will reduce capital appreciation  a low beginning valuation will enhance capital appreciation   When a company s beginning valuation is in alignment with earnings  capital appreciation will be highly correlated with the company s earnings growth rate

Earnings Forecasts
The  Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator  provides several specific future year s earnings forecasts   Specific near term earnings forecasts  varies from two to four years  are provided to include the number of analysts reporting to S P Capital IQ  yellow and green highlights    Additionally  a long term  three to five year  growth rate is also provided  orange highlights    The specific number of analysts offering the long term forecast is found in the FAST FACTS box  orange circle   
Therefore  we highly recommend placing more credence on the near term forecasts because they are likely to be more accurate   Moreover  near term forecasts tend to include a greater number of analysts in the consensus 
The graph below reports consensus earnings of  7 99 for fiscal 2014 according to 26 analysts reporting to S P Capital IQ followed by  9 27 for fiscal 2015 according to 27 analysts and  10 00 for fiscal 2016 according to 23 analysts  These near term forecasts for earnings growth indicate that Gilead is extremely undervalued at current levels 

Earnings Yield
Shareholders in publically traded companies  even though they are passive owners  can expect to be rewarded for their investment in proportion to the company s earnings capacity   Consequently  the earnings yield calculated from current and future  expected  earnings represents an important valuation consideration  
Based on consensus estimates for 2014 s earnings  Gilead offers a current earnings yield of 8 3    However  since investors are always buying the future  the potential for high earnings yield is extremely robust  assuming earnings growth continues 

FUNdamentals   A Deeper Look
Utilizing FUN Graphs  fundamental underlying numbers   the following important fundamental metrics and key ratios are offered to provide a deeper look into the company s financial strength and current valuation 
Balance Sheet Income Statement
The following balance sheet items are offered to reveal the financial health of the company   They include assets per share  atps   cash and equivalents per share  cashps  and common equity or book value per share  ceps  
The following income statement item  revenues per share  revps  is offered to reveal the consistency of revenue growth    

Gross and Net Profit Margins

Return on Assets  Equity and Invested Capital

Key Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity is an important consideration when evaluating a business   The primary liquidity ratio that prudent investors look to is the current ratio  cr  
Additionally  the current ratio  cr  measures the company s ability to retire its short term liabilities  debt and payables  with its short term assets  cash  inventory and receivables    This important ratio is often referred to as the liquidity ratio and is a good indicator of a company s ability to remain a going concern   Gilead s current ratio in the most recent quarter  MRQ  was a very healthy 2 5   
Since many investors are concerned about price volatility  we have included five year beta as an additional key ratio   A beta of one or lower is considered ideal relative to risk   On the other hand  a beta above one may also indicate the potential for above market long term performance 

Additional Key Valuation Ratios
Two important valuation ratios that investors consider are price to book value  pb  and price to sales  ps    When considering both of these valuation ratios  the lower the better  

Key Management Shareholder Friendly Metrics
Many investors consider a company s shareholder friendliness based on its dividend policy and or share buyback policy   A consistent record of paying dividends  and better yet  increasing the dividend are considered positive attributes of management  
However  many companies in the growth phase may consider it more profitable to retain their cash to fund growth   Consequently  the lack of a dividend does not necessarily indicate that management is not shareholder friendly 
Regarding share buybacks  they are considered friendly because they are anti dilutive   However  share buybacks should only be considered shareholder friendly when management is buying back shares when stock price is sound or undervalued 

Summary and Conclusions
Investors are often deterred from investing in a stock when its price reaches an all time high as it recently has in Gilead   However  those same investors often fail to recognize that price and valuation are not the same   In the case of Gilead  its current valuation remains quite attractive in spite of its recent price rise because of 2014 s explosive growth of earnings primarily attributed to the recent approval and sales of Sovaldi   However  there are additional pipeline opportunities that suggest future earnings growth to continue  albeit at lower rates than 2014   Consequently  based on valuation  Gilead appears to be a very attractive growth story for at least the next couple of years   In other words  it s not too late 
Moreover  most of the risks associated with Gilead s future earnings power have been reduced based on recent reports and rulings   The following articles from The Wall Street Journal  Barron s and MarketWatch support this view

202078,423594,GILD,Gilead Sciences Inc  Strong Growth At An Unreasonably Low Price ,opinion,Gilead Sciences Inc  GILD  is an innovative healthcare company with a strong record of historical earnings growth and expectations for above average growth into the future  Nevertheless  Mr  Market seems unwilling to recognize the past and future earnings power of this niche pharmaceutical growth stock  Consequently  the company trades at a single digit PE ratio that we believe significantly undervalues both the company s past and future potential  Therefore  investors seeking high growth at a reasonable level of risk might want to look further into this undervalued growth opportunity Growth stocks are defined as companies with high rates of change of earnings growth of 15  to 20  or better  Growth stocks offer the potential for share prices to rise in lockstep with their profit growth in the long run  Therefore  the PEG ratio formula  price equals growth rate  tends to be the most appropriate formula used to value growth stocks  However  due to the exponential nature of compounding large numbers  PEG ratio forecasts are capped at 40  Because of the higher valuation typically awarded to fast growth  growth stocks offer the potential for greater capital appreciation  On the other hand  they also offer higher risk  First of all  they tend to command much higher than average PE ratios  and second  achieving very high levels of growth is very difficult to sustain  Consequently  forecasting future earnings growth is more important with high growth stocks than any other class of stock  Also  the average growth stock typically ploughs all of its profits back into the company to fund its future growth  instead of paying dividends Gilead Sciences Inc   Large cap Growth at an Attractive PriceGilead Sciences is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need  The company s mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide  Headquartered in Foster City  California  Gilead has operations in North America  Europe and Asia Pacific     Earnings Determine Market Price   The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  Here is a link to a live and fully functioning graph on   We suggest running graphs over numerous time frames as part of a more comprehensive fundamental analysis    Gilead Sciences Inc   Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 2004  Performance Table Gilead Sciences IncThe Two Keys to Long Term PerformanceYears of research and experience have taught us that there are two critically important keys to achieving above average  long term shareholder returns at reasonably controlled levels of risk  The first key is earnings growth  or what we like to call the rate of change of earnings growth  The faster a company can grow its business  i e  earnings   the larger the income stream it can produce with which to reward shareholders  This is because of the power of compounding  which Albert Einstein was alleged to have called  the most powerful force on earth   Ultimately  both capital appreciation and dividend income will be a function of a company s ability to grow its profits The second key is valuation  When a company can be purchased at its intrinsic value based on earnings and cash flow generation  the shareholders  rate of return or long term capital appreciation will inevitably correlate to and or equal its earnings growth rate  Overvaluation will lower that rate of return and conversely  undervaluation will increase it  Consequently  paying strict attention to the valuation you pay to buy a stock is a critical component of both greater return and taking lower risk to achieve it  Because  ironically  when you overpay for even the best business  you simultaneously lower your return potential while increasing your risk of achieving the lower return The associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two keys to long term performance  Notice the impact that valuation  black line above or below orange earnings justified valuation line  had on the following performance results  The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2004 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio   The current price to sales ratio for Gilead Sciences Inc is 4 33 which is historically low  Looking to the Future   Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants    1            The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings   2            The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings   Forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance    Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  Gilead Sciences Inc is clearly an industry leading superior business  which based on the consensus estimates from leading analysts  appears to be capable of growing earnings at an above average rate for the foreseeable future  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Gilead Sciences Inc represents an opportunity for growth at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Gilead Sciences Inc  with its strong balance sheet and potential for future earnings growth  has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for outsized future returns    The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions    The consensus of 28 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Gilead Sciences Inc s long term earnings growth at 17   Gilead Sciences Inc has medium long term debt at 53  of capital  Gilead Sciences Inc is currently trading at a P E of 13 4  which is below the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 20 4  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Gilead Sciences Inc s True Worth  valuation would be  139 05 at the end of 2017  which would be a 20  annual rate of return from the current price  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows   All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stake holders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any perspective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Gilead Sciences Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Gilead Sciences Inc s expected earnings would be 9 7 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary   ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although  with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conducts their own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not At its current quotation  Gilead Sciences Inc appears to offer significant upside based on several factors  First of all  the company is trading at a below average PE ratio even though it offers above average growth  Therefore  the aggressive investor could be rewarded with significant PE expansion in addition to above average growth  Furthermore  since the stock is trading art a single digit PE ratio  we believe there is little downside assuming the company s fundamentals do not significant deteriorate  Therefore  this may be an ideal research candidate for the aggressive investor seeking maximum capital appreciation at controlled levels of risk  Disclosure   No position at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this
