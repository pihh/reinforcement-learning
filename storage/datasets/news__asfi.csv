5732,227247,ASFI,Asta Receives Uplift,opinion,Just 15 months ago  shares of Asta Funding could be had for  6 and change  At that time  the stock was brought up on this site as a potential value investment  Since then  the shares are up some 50   offering investors the opportunity to exit after a quick but monumental rise  This was far from a perfect stock  Despite a large discount to book value  management appeared more intent on growing the company than generating shareholder returns  The focus was  is  on an acquisition  even though it was Asta s own shares that likely provided the best investment opportunity  Now that the price has run up  management has become more active with buybacks  in a glaring case of  too little  too late   But the discount to book value was so large that an opportunity for investors was present despite the negatives  In addition  book value was likely understated  Now  however  the stock trades a lot closer to book value  but the risks of a large acquisition remain  Investors may wish to deploy the capital gained from this investment into other Stock Ideas  or they may wish to cash out and lie in wait until such time as the market offers better opportunities  Disclosure  No position ,2012-10-08,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asta-receives-uplift-138981,138981
