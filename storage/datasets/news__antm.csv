190791,412307,ANTM,Why Investors Didn t Like Anthem s Q4 Update,news,"Anthem  NYSE ANTM  lagged behind the S P 500 last year  but investors probably didn t complain too much about a 15  return  However  the big health insurer hasn t gotten off to a great start so far in 2020 
The company announced its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Wednesday  and those results could cause concerns about Anthem to grow  Here are the highlights from Anthem s Q4 update 

By the numbers
Anthem announced Q4 revenue of  27 4 billion  a 17  increase from the  23 4 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous year  This result was also higher than the average analysts  revenue estimate of  27 1 billion 
The company reported net income in the fourth quarter of  934 million  or  3 62 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This reflected strong growth from net income of  424 million  or  1 61 per share  recorded in the prior year period  
Anthem posted adjusted net income in the fourth quarter of  3 88 per share  This was a big jump from the company s adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  2 44 in the same quarter of 2018  It also met the consensus estimate from analysts for adjusted earnings 
Behind the numbers
Anthem reported that its membership totaled 41 million as of Dec  31  2019  up 2 7  year over year  During the fourth quarter  the company s membership increased by 16 000 covered lives from the previous quarter  This membership growth  combined with rate increases  fueled Anthem s year over year operating revenue growth of 16 4  
The company s benefit expense ratio  which compares the expenses for underwriting insurance with the premiums received from the policies  increased to 89  in Q4 from 86 8  in the prior year period  Anthem attributed this increase primarily to the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2019 
Anthem s government business segment continued to be the brightest spot for the company in the fourth quarter  Operating revenue jumped 12 6  year over year to  16 2 billion  The company s commercial and specialty business also grew  but at a much slower rate  with Q4 revenue rising 5 5  to  9 3 billion 
Looking ahead
Despite Anthem beating the consensus Wall Street revenue estimate and meeting the earnings estimate  the health insurer s shares fell by 4  in early trading on Wednesday  Why  Investors didn t like Anthem s full year 2020 guidance 
The company projects that operating revenue in full year 2020 will be around  117 billion  That s actually a little higher than the average analysts  estimate of  115 3 billion  The problem  though  is with Anthem s full year earnings outlook  Anthem expects earnings of  21 44 per share  below the consensus analysts  estimate of  22 71 per share 
Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux stated that the company has  strong momentum moving into 2020   However  a weaker than expected earnings outlook raises questions about that momentum  In addition  healthcare stocks in general could experience increased volatility this year as the U S  presidential campaign heats up  Several leading presidential candidates have proposed sweeping changes to the U S  healthcare system that could negatively affect Anthem s business ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pojh1,2070909

Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by  Welcome to the Anthem fourth quarter earnings conference call   Operator instructions  As a reminder  this conference is being recorded  I would now like to turn the conference over to the company s management  Please go ahead Chris Rigg    Vice President of Investor Relations Good morning  and welcome to Anthem s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call  This is Chris Rigg  vice president of investor relations  And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux  president and CEO  John Gallina  our CFO  Pete Haytaian  president of our commercial and specialty business division  and Felicia Norwood  president of our government business division  Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our fourth quarter financial results  followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprisewide growth priorities  John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and review our 2020 financial guidance  We will then be available for Q A  During the call  we will reference certain non GAAP measures  Reconciliations of these non GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website  antheminc com We will also be making some forward looking statements on this call  Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem  These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations  We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC  I will now turn the call over to Gail  Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining Anthem s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call  In 2019  Anthem delivered strong top and bottom line growth across the enterprise  We achieved record organic top line growth of 13   and we had our best year of organic  risk based membership growth in over a decade  At our investor day last March  we talked about this being a new era for Anthem  one focused on growth  innovation and the transformation of healthcare as we know it  We also committed to long term revenue growth of 10  to 12  and adjusted earnings per share growth of 12  to 15   10 months later  we delivered on our commitments  and we are poised for another year of success in 2020  In the fourth quarter  we reported GAAP earnings per share of  3 62 and adjusted earnings per share of  3 88  For the full year  we delivered GAAP earnings per share of  18 47 and adjusted earnings per share of  19 44  up 22  versus the prior year  Our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than  22 30 represents core growth near the upper end of our long term guidance range when normalized to the impact of the health insurer fee beginning in 2021  We also expect another strong year of revenue growth  over 13  on a reported basis and nearly 12  on a HIF adjusted basis  On January 1st of this year  we successfully completed the IngenioRx migration  transitioning more than 15 million people over the past eight months  The launch of IngenioRx is a key milestone in the realization of our strategy to integrate pharmacy with medical and behavioral health as part of whole person care  The success of our accelerated migration will allow us to deliver greater healthcare value and increased transparency to the people we serve  At investor day  we also shared our goal of reducing our number of technology platforms from six to two by the end of 2022  Today  I am pleased to share that we are well on our way and expect to have 80  of our consumers on their destination platform by the end of this year  By reengineering our business processes and simplifying our technology infrastructure  we are driving greater operating performance  and we re making it easier to do business with Anthem  We remain committed to keeping healthcare affordable and slowing healthcare spending growth  by partnering with care providers through value based care arrangements and by empowering consumers with the information they need to take an active role in their own health and wellness  Today  Anthem has more than 60  of medical spend tied to value based care arrangements  with 32  in upside  downside risk arrangements  creating greater alignment of cost quality  while delivering improved health outcomes  Total health  total you  our integrated end to end digital first clinical model  now serves more than two million consumers since its introduction in 2018  Using both AI and machine learning to engage members with emerging risks  Total health  total you had delivered a nearly 12  reduction in hospital admissions and a reduction in emergency room visits of more than 10  to date  In our commercial business  we improved sales effectiveness and strengthened how we work with our distribution partners through investments in our front end broker portal and sales management technology  We added valuable digital capabilities that make it easier for our broker partners to do business with us  Our integrated tools are helping to ensure that our distribution partners can seamlessly sell and renew Anthem s medical and specialty businesses  Our focus on upgrading talent and improving sales execution helped us deliver one of our strongest overall commercial membership growth performances in more than a decade  while maintaining our pricing discipline  Sales of specialty benefits  pharmacy solutions and clinical programs exceeded expectations in 2019  with specialty products growing by more than 1 million members and at a rate faster than our medical membership  Overall fee based profitability is increasing  and we are well on our way to narrowing the profit gap between risk based and fee based members from five to one to three to 1  Shifting to our government business  We recognize that social and environmental factors are intrinsically tied to a person s health  Among all social barriers  food and security is the most pervasive  affecting one in eight Americans  Since its inception 20 years ago  the Anthem Foundation has been fighting food and security  and our impact is being felt across the country  Because of our efforts  Anthem is one of only 50 companies and the only national healthcare company to be deemed a leadership partner by Feeding America  the nation s largest domestic hunger relief organization  Our focus on service  and positively impacting our local communities  continues to be a hallmark of our culture at Anthem  In Medicaid  despite facing challenges with changing risk pool as a result of enrollment reverification throughout the first half of 2019  the second half of the year was strong  and our state business ended the year in line with expectations  We continued our strong track record of winning more than 80  of Medicaid procurements in 2019  And we continue to see an  80 billion pipeline of opportunity over the long term  And as we announced last week  we were pleased to welcome two new Medicaid health plans into Anthem  The new plans in Missouri and Nebraska allow us to expand our industry leading specialized care to more than 300 000 new consumers  bringing our full Medicaid reach to a total of 23 states in the district of Columbia  During the year  Medicare Advantage enrollment grew by more than 20   outpacing the market and in line with our guidance  As of year end  we are now the fourth largest individual Medicare Advantage plan in the nation  Our steady momentum is carrying over into 2020  as we saw solid growth during the annual enrollment period  and we expect our membership growth rate to continue to lead the industry for the fourth year in a row  Similar to 2019  our growth is tied to our strong brand recognition among seniors  along with our robust supplemental offerings  which are unmatched in the industry  Our essential extras benefit is highly valued by seniors as it provides coverage for services such as healthy food delivery  transportation  home assistance  alternative medicine and more  Additionally  our over the counter benefit continues to be valued by this important population  Sales of Medicare Part D also accelerated during the recent annual enrollment period  reflecting our improved pharmacy cost structure  enabling us to compete more effectively  We are entering 2020 with confidence in our ability to drive growth  reduce costs and create meaningful change within the overall healthcare system  Our business expectations include robust membership growth of 1 1 million members  at the midpoint of our guidance  driven by growth in both risk and fee based membership  Despite the return of the health insurer fee in 2020  we anticipate stable commercial risk based membership  a significant improvement compared to the decline experienced in 2018  the last time the HIF returned  We expect growth to continue in our specialty businesses at a pace similar to 2019  in addition to delivering strong clinical program and pharmacy benefit sales  Medicaid membership is expected to grow in the 400 000 member range  excluding the implementation of the North Carolina contract  which is likely to be delayed until 2021  Once again  we expect Medicare Advantage membership to surpass the industry growth rate and increase by 150 000 to 200 000 in both individual and group Medicare Advantage  We will also continue to invest in digital technologies and innovations to enhance engagement with the people we serve and to achieve our goal of making healthcare simpler  more affordable and more effective  Our innovative Sydney application provides wellness incentive packages  health and wellness content  telehealth services and full integration with our electronic health record  Interest in this new digital tool has been strong  with more than 625 000 downloads since its launch last October  In addition  livehealth online  our easy to use telehealth solution  grew by nearly 40  over the prior year  giving people greater flexibility over where and how they receive care  And finally  Anthem s focus on social responsibility and sustainability continues to gain national attention  We were pleased to be included on Fortune s list of most admired companies again this year and recognized by Bloomberg on their list of companies exemplifying gender equality  And now I ll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers  John John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Gail  and good morning  As Gail stated  we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial results  and are well positioned for robust growth in 2020  Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was  3 88  up 59  year over year  For the full year  adjusted earnings per share was  19 44  representing growth of 22  over 2018  2019 was a year of major milestones at Anthem  As Gail mentioned earlier  we successfully launched IngenioRx on an accelerated and compressed time line with minimal customer abrasion  After adjusting for the benefit from IngenioRx  which contributed a little more than  1 to our full year results  earnings grew at the upper end of our 12  to 15  target range  Simply put  our core business is solid  and we are delivering real growth across each of our segments  Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was  27 1 billion  an increase of 16  over the prior year quarter  This increase in operating revenue was driven by membership growth in our risk based businesses  premium increases to cover overall trends  revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and increased penetration of our specialty and integrated clinical offerings  For the full year  operating revenue grew nearly 13  or 15  on a HIF adjusted basis  coming in solidly above our 10  to 12  target range  Overall  the fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 89   representing an increase of 220 basis points over the prior year  which  as expected  was primarily driven by the one year waiver of the health insurer fee  The remaining drivers of the medical loss ratio coming in at the high end of our expectations included the fact that with our excellent results in the Individual business  we reduced our risk adjuster position by  50 million and the flu season started earlier than normal  resulting in more flu costs than expected in the fourth quarter  Medical costs continued to be well maintained and in line with our expectations  And our local group medical cost trend approximated 6  for the year  The SG A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 12 9   a decline of 260 basis points over the prior year  driven by a robust  double digit top line growth  combined with the one year waiver of the health insurer fee  along with our continued focus on operational efficiency  Turning to the balance sheet  The debt to cap ratio was 39 5  at the end of 2019  consistent with our target range  During the quarter  we took advantage of weakness in our stock price and repurchased 1 2 million shares at a weighted average price of  260 87  In total  we repurchased approximately  1 7 billion of stock in 2019 or 6 3 million shares  consistent with our guidance provided last quarter  Full year operating cash flow was  6 1 billion  reflecting 58  growth over 2018  Operating cash flow exceeded expectations through the year  coming in well above our previous outlook of greater than  5 5 billion and was primarily driven by growth in our government businesses  Our full year operating cash flow at 1 3 times net income illustrates the high quality of earnings in 2019  Now to our 2020 guidance  Before I begin  it is important to note that our 2020 guidance includes the acquisitions of the Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid plans that closed last week  but does not include the pending acquisition of Beacon  which we now expect to close later in the first quarter  We are also closing on the TPA acquisition that will enhance Anthem s already strong capabilities in the large group segment  Anthem is already the largest customer of this TPA  but that acquisition will increase our self funded membership by 200 000 and is already included in our membership guidance  As Gail stated earlier  total medical membership is expected to reach 42 1 million members at the guidance midpoint or a growth of 1 1 million members  In 2020  we expect operating revenue to grow over 13  to approximately  117 billion  reflecting premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends and the return of the health insurer fee as well as membership growth and the full year impact from the launch of IngenioRx  The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 85 8   plus or minus 50 basis points  a decrease of 100 basis points at the midpoint and largely driven by the return of the health insurer fee  The MLR is further impacted by changing business mix where the government business continues to be the faster growing portion of our business  including the Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid acquisitions and margin normalization in the individual business  These headwinds are partially offset by improved Medicaid performance  As a result of our improved pharmacy cost structure with the launch of IngenioRx  coupled with medical cost management initiatives  we expect our local group medical cost trend to be in the range of 4   plus or minus 50 basis points  The SG A expense ratio is expected to be 12 8   plus or minus 30 basis points  primarily due to growth in operating revenue and reduced spending related to the IngenioRx migration  Looking to below the line  we project investment income of  970 million and interest expense of  815 million  The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24  to 26   with the increase primarily driven by the return of the nondeductible health insurer fee in 2020  Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than  6 4 billion  contributing to another year of quality earnings  Our long term capital deployment targets are unchanged  and we remain committed to delivering sustainable  long term shareholder returns  Anthem has increased its dividend every year since it began paying dividends  and we have done so again in 2020  increasing our dividend by nearly 19   We expect full year share repurchases of at least  1 5 billion and our weighted average share count to end the year in the range of 255 million to 257 million shares outstanding  The permanent repeal of the health insurer fee beginning in 2021 represents a significant step forward in improving the affordability of healthcare and is consistent with our commitment to driving the lowest net cost of care for our members  With that said  our full year 2020 outlook now incorporates a total health insurer fee related headwind of approximately  0 80  of which approximately  0 50 have been included in our prior commentary  We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share of greater than  22 30  which includes a benefit of  2 30 related to the full year contribution from IngenioRx and the incremental headwind from the repeal of the health insurer tax beginning in 2021  This level of earnings represents growth of over 40  since 2018  Finally  it is important to keep in mind that the seasonality of earnings and key financial metrics will be impacted by a number of factors this year  The first half of 2020 will benefit from the IngenioRx contribution  which was immaterial to the financial results in the first half of 2019  In addition  leap day and the number of workdays in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 will increase the HIF adjusted MLR by nearly 100 basis points  with the impact reversing the rest of the year  Further  a majority of the margin normalization in the individual business will occur in the first half of the year  whereas the improvement in Medicaid will be more evenly distributed throughout the year  Taken together  we expect first half earnings will approximate 55  of the full year total  with a little more than half of that coming in the first quarter  In total  2020 will be another strong year  And with that  we will now open the call for questions  Operator  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  And we will go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi  Please go ahead Ralph Giacobbe    Citi    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  I just want to go to sort of back to the MLR and the commentary there  You came in  obviously  at the higher end of the range that you had raised in 3Q  I know you mentioned sort of the risk adjuster  maybe visibility on kind of when you got details there  And then the medical cost growth for 2020  obviously  the 4   plus or minus 50 basis points  obviously  aided by the Ingenio savings  But maybe if you can kind of exclude that and maybe help how you see sort of core trends for comparability in  20 versus the 6  that you cited for 2019  Thanks John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Hi  Good morning  Ralph  And this is John  Thank you for the question  In terms of the 2019 medical loss ratio  we did end the year at 86 8   which was within the guidance range that had been previously provided  We certainly would have been below the high end of the range had it not been for a couple of nonrecurring issues that serve to increase the ratio at the end of the year  First  with the exceptional performance we ve had in our individual business and after reviewing the Wakely information and doing our own analysis  we did reduce our risk adjusted position by  50 million  That goes through as a negative to the MLR  It increases MLR when you do things like that  And then the flu season  it began earlier than anticipated  And so there s more flu cost in 2019  in the fourth quarter of 2019 that had been anticipated  So obviously  we covered both of those with all of our earnings information  But without those two really nonrecurring issues  we would have been below the high end of the range  and we still ended up within the range  Associated with 2020  obviously  a lot of moving parts  We re very  very excited to have a 4  cost trend  We are pricing for that  And our pricing remains very disciplined  but we think that will really help us in terms of future growth potential Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Next question  please OperatorAnd we ll go to Justin Lake with Wolf Research  Please go ahead Justin Lake    Wolfe Research    Analyst Thanks  Before I get to my question  I just want to follow up on Ralph s quickly  In terms of being at the higher end of the range  ex that  50 million  you still would have been around 86 8   I don t know what the flu costs are  But it s been a trend of two to three quarters now where it s been pushing toward the high end rather than the midpoint  And if you guys understand that from our viewpoint  it s hard to understand what s driving that  So is there anything you can tell us that would give us comfort that there s not some trend inside the business that maybe hasn t been fully taken account and might be a headwind into 2020  And then my question is around membership growth for next year  specifically around Medicare Advantage  Gail  I think you said 150 000 to 200 000  Is that 150 000 to 200 000 total  Or is that 150 000 to 200 000 in each of individual and group  And if it s 150 000 to 200 000 in total  can you tell us how that breaks down Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Let me ask John to first discuss the medical cost and MLR issues  and then I ll come back to membership  John John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Justin  I certainly understand your perspective  but there really isn t anything that s working beneath the surface that causes an issue for 2020  And just to level set the 2020  maybe I ll talk about that for a moment  We did end 2019 at 86 8   Our guidance for next year is 85 8   So that s an improvement of 100 basis points  But given the fact that the HIF is out  the HIF is in and the dynamics of that and pricing for the tax nondeductibility  on an apples to apples basis  you could expect that our MLR would go down by 150 basis points in 2020  and it s going down 100  So that s actually a 50 basis point increase  And it s really    it s largely the result of business mix  And I really can t emphasize enough how much the mix does change the our government business continues to be growing    a growing portion of our premium revenue  very strong growth  We ve had some of the best organic growth in the sector over the last several years  And the fully insured growth has been driven primarily by the government business division  And the government s MLR is higher than the company s average  And so then  that causes the overall MLR increase  I will say that our pricing does remain disciplined  and we cover cost trends  So we feel very comfortable with our guidance and expectations  and that the numbers for 2020 are very solid Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Justin  in terms of your second question around Medicare Advantage membership  Yes  that is a total number  As you think about the breakdown  it s roughly 75  individual MA and about 25  group  In terms of the overall numbers  we feel very strongly about our    as I mentioned  our individual MA growth  And actually  we re coming off of strong growth in the group market in 2019  And as we think about 2020  we re expecting additional growth in group  But again  just the time line of the procurements has been a little bit longer  but we still feel very strongly about our group offering  The brand is resonating extremely well  and we re really pleased  again  with the individual MA open enrollment season that we just had and the    that we will grow at a pace faster than the industry once again  So thanks for the question  and next question please OperatorWe ll go to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead AJ Rice    Credit Suisse    Analyst Hi  everybody  Just one quick point of clarification to John s comment and then a question about margin trends for 2020  It sounds like on the third quarter call  you guys were sort of implying in your broad comments that it would be at least  22 50 or at least  22 60  Based on John s comments  the fact that it s now at least  22 30  It sounds like that s 100  due to the HIF repeal  which was not expected  I just want to confirm that  And then just more of the margin trends for 2020  Is there any way to flesh out a little bit how much of a headwind  normalization the individual margin is  How much of a tailwind the comments about Medicaid are next year versus this year  And sort of how those will impact the margin  And I m assuming you re assuming relative stability of Medicare  but maybe that s not true  Can you comment on that John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer No  thank you for that one question  AJ  I ll do my best to see if I can answer it  But on the 2020 guidance  you re exactly correct  Our core assumptions from the third quarter are unchanged  The growth rates that we had  that we laid out in terms of Ingenio adding  2 30 for the year contributed a little bit more than  1 to 2019  increasing our earnings by the low end of the 12  to 15  growth rate that we had promised at investor day  And that included covering a  0 50 HIF headwind that we knew about  But what we didn t know about was that there will be a permanent repeal of the HIF starting in 2021  And when you look at how that impacts our 2020 mid year renewals  that the 2020 midyear renewals no longer need to charge and price for that incremental cost structure  And so the impact on 2020 is an incremental  0 30 headwind on top of what had been communicated in the third quarter  And so that is entirely the differential between today s guidance and the expectations that we had from 90 days ago  The    that was the first question  Actually  could you repeat the other part of the question AJ Rice    Credit Suisse    Analyst It s in your guidance in terms of headwinds and tailwinds on the margin John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Thank you  AJ  That was the individual margin normalization versus Medicaid  We have been talking all along about how those two mitigated each other  As we finalized our plans for 2020  and we ve been working very  very hard with the states and everything else  we expect that the margin normalization from individual will probably be about 10 basis points worse in terms of margin than the incremental benefit that we expect to achieve from improvement in the Medicaid business  So that s about a 10 basis point impact on overall margins  And also  that 10 basis points works its way through the MLR calculation as well  I didn t really talk about that as part of the 50 basis point increase in MLR  but that s part of that reconciling item as well  is that the individual headwind is about 10 basis points more than the Medicaid tailwind Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  John  And just a quick comment sort of reaffirming what John said  Overall  our guidance is very consistent with what we said  And also  we view  obviously  the repeal of the health insurer fee as a big positive for affordability and are very pleased that that happened  Next question  please OperatorAnd we ll go to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Steve Tanal    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Good morning  guys  I guess I just wanted to dig into a little bit the fully insured enrollment outlook as well as the MBR guidance and trying to square this all with the  4 billion of pharmacy cost savings  I guess  it seems like growth could have been a little bit better or MBR maybe a little lower  If I m doing the math right  it looks like commercial fully insured enrollment is implied down about 130 000 to up 120 000 when I take the 2020 fully insured aggregate growth outlook and net out Medicaid and MA  So first  I wanted to confirm if we re thinking about commercial risk right that way  And I guess  maybe  Pete  any commentary on how you ve been able to use those savings to drive enrollment gains or attention  And John  any thoughts on sort of the MBR  And whether you could add lower than the range or somewhere toward the lower end  if you end up burning more than at least 20  that you guys have committed to in the past  that would be helpful Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Great  Thank you for the many questions  We ll try to hit them each  but just in terms of fully insured  and I ll have Pete give some commentary on that  If you look at the midpoint of our guidance  essentially  we re guiding to flat commercial risk membership  And remember  if you think about the return of the health insurer fee  when this occurred a few years ago  the market overall was down pretty significantly as were we  So our growth is actually inside of that when you think about flat quite good  given the market dynamics  But let me ask Pete to give some additional commentary about what s really happening inside of this Pete Haytaian    President  Commercial and Specialty Business Division Yes  that s it  Thanks  Steve  and thanks  Gail  It s exactly right  We re very pleased with our fully insured growth  You saw that play through in 2019  We ve experienced growth in the large group and four out of the last five quarters  And as Gail said  the flat nature of our growth in 2020 is really this one large account  which is not really that unusual in light of the fact that the HIF coming back and a very large account moving from fully insured to ASO  And as Gail said  the last time this happened was in 2018  and we saw a mid single digit progression in membership  So a really nice improvement from that perspective  But longer term  outside of that one large client  our fully insured growth would have been positive in 2020  And now with the value of Ingenio coming through  you d asked about that  and yes  we are seeing that play through in our value  It s very nice to have that play through in a year when the HIF was coming back  So that was definitely an offset  And then all the things that we ve talked about in the past  our product portfolio  our sub segment strategy  what we re doing around brokers and broker engagement are all really playing through  So again  longer term  outside of this one large account  we see positive growth in the large fully insured and fully insured business in general John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  And thank you  Steve  for the    following up on the other part of your question on the  4 billion savings from a full year implementation of IngenioRx  We re actually very excited about that because at the end of the day  that  4 billion in savings makes healthcare more affordable  And group trend is just one aspect of that business and a very important aspect  And    but as we ve stated in the past  the impact of the savings and the  3 2 billion that we re returning to the customers  it s really based on a market by market  line of business by line of business assessment  And each marketplace is a little bit different  Our competitive advantage differs in certain marketplaces in the extent that we re close to an MLR rebate  We obviously would include it all into the pricing  In the extent that we have really good market share and really good competitive positioning  we may let a little bit more drop to the bottom line  And then you have to go back through line of business by line of business  In our ASO  some of our customers have passed through pricing  They actually receive 100  of the benefit of the better pricing  In Medicare Advantage  we are utilizing the benefit to offset some of the four star headwinds that we have  All in  we continue to reaffirm that at least 20  is going to hit the bottom line  and the rest will be returned to the customers  Yes  we always do aspire to do more  aspire to do better  But right now  our guidance is pretty solid Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Next question  please OperatorWe will go to Stephen Valiquette with Barclays  Please go ahead Stephen Valiquette    Barclays    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  everybody  So even though the  50 million risk adjuster reduction only impacted MLR by 20 bps in the quarter  just curious if you re able to provide just a little more color around the decision tree and when it makes sense for you guys to alter that position  Really just trying to understand if this is something that could occur really at any given time in any quarter going forward  How should we think about the volatility around this in future periods  Thanks John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Sure  No  great question  Steve  And in terms of our risk adjuster position  obviously  we evaluate it and monitor it on a regular basis  Many of the things in the individual marketplace or a zero sum game  we don t have the appropriate transparency into everyone else s risk pools and everyone else s risk adjuster scores  We utilize a third party service called Wakely that many of the companies in our industry utilize to do estimates  We take that along with our own competitive intelligence and our own knowledge and analysis  and we make adjustments as appropriate  There was a Wakely report that was provided to the entire industry in mid December that was utilized by us as part of our overall assessment  Wakely does a report multiple times a year  So    but we ve been very accurate over the past several years  And our estimates have been very  very good  So we feel good about the estimate  And quite honestly  it occurred for a really good reason  And that s because we were over performing on that block of business Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Next question  please OperatorAnd we ll go to Gary Taylor with J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Gary Taylor    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hi  good morning  I just have one question  but I thought maybe I d ask 15 since that s going to be the trend today  The one question I have  I just want to ask about Ingenio  and if there s any possibility we re going to have any increased segment disclosure for 2020  The PBM revenue and fees are all rolled up in that single line  So even though you ve given us a cost of goods dollar amount  we can t really see the gross margin  And to some degree  I think that s a bit of a ridge and some of your guidance versus our model  So I guess the question is  would we consider any additional disclosure  And are you willing to give us a little help just on the gross margin as opposed to just the dollar COGS for 2020 John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Sure  No  thank you  Gary  and I appreciate you asking one question  But the answer to the segment reporting question is  we will follow the rules and requirements as promulgated by the SEC and to certainly adhere to their guidelines for segment reporting  There is a very good chance that at some point here in 2020  if Ingenio has the growth that we expected to have  that it will require us to break out and have a third segment  And at that point in time  we will provide that information as well as comparative information  But until we re required by the SEC to provide that additional segment  we re going to maintain our current segment reporting structure  Just maybe a little bit of help to give you  As you can see in the press release  our cost of products sold is  7 1 billion at the midpoint  In order to get Ingenio revenue  you really have to add the  2 30 or approximately  800 million back to that because that s the area where it s going to be reported  And then there s a G A load associated with the administrative staffing of Ingenio  And you have to have both of those to get to what the impact of the Ingenio revenue is  which is a little bit more than  8 billion  So hopefully  that s helpful to your modeling Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Next question  please OperatorAnd we ll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Yeah  hi  Good morning  So I know it s too early to talk about 2021  But just a couple of questions on how you think about that  So first of all  when we think about Ingenio  any early thoughts about the 2021 selling season  what you are seeing  And do you think that you are ready to start actively competing for external PBM business  And then secondly  when we think about the HIF gone for 2021  any preliminary thoughts on how you re going to apply the tailwind between reinvesting in the business to improve benefit design versus savings that are flowing through to the bottom line Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you for the question  Ricky  A couple of things  One  you re right  We re not going to be giving guidance yet on 2021  But in terms of a little color on IngenioRx  a couple of big opportunities  First  we re really pleased with the way that the migration of the 15 million members went  And I think it really demonstrated the operational capability that we have inside of this business is quite mature  and that has been a real positive  The big opportunity we have in 2020  and I mentioned this in some of my prepared remarks and in  21  is to increase the penetration in our own self funded book of business  Right now  we re in the range of only about 20  well below all of our competitors and others in the space  That s really been driven heavily by the non competitiveness of our prior arrangement  and we re seeing real big opportunities for us as we    both in 2020 as well as in 2021  So that  first and foremost  is our primary  In terms of external operations  as you know  those are long term procurements  We do feel that we re ready to compete in that  We were really pleased to bring on Blue Cross of Idaho this year for January  and that has gone well  But again  in terms of the exact timing  these are 3 year cycles generally  We will be competing for them  In terms of when those procurements come through will be a little bit more lumpy than exactly in  21  but we feel really well prepared  And again  our big opportunities are within our own existing book of business  And then  again  we re really pleased with what we saw in the Part D growth this year  It s really the first year that we ve been competitive in the Medicare Part D  Ingenio gives us an opportunity to also be more competitive in Medicare Advantage  our individual and group membership  So across the board  we see it as a nice growth accelerator for both commercial and government  Thanks very much for the question  Next question  please OperatorAnd that will be Peter Costa with Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Peter Costa    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Good morning  The other side of the mix issue  relative to MLR is SG A  And it seems like your SG A has come in better than expected all this year  You d originally  at your investor day  you had a target for 2023 of 11  to 12   and then for  19 of 13 and a half percent for SG A  and you came in below 13   Can you talk about whether the target for 2023 is now further improved  And then also just in terms of as we think about the progression to that  have we    are we still linearly progressing to that  Or is it something that we should be thinking about  we just got an acceleration this year because of the mix John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer No  thank you  Pete  Great question  And in terms of the improvement  we are very  very happy with some of the operational efficiencies and just some of the better processes that we now have  things that really make the experience better and easier for the customer  And at the end of the day  that s the most important part  The systems migration is going to be 80  complete by the end of this year  And then we can continue on from there  Gail talked about a six to two  So I would say that just given some of those issues  the improvement is not going to be linear through 2023  It will be a little bit better here in the first few years as we get through the systems migration as we re investing heavily in digital right now and as we get those capabilities up and running  for instance  that maybe there s a bit of a heavier load  2019 was negatively impacted by the early acceleration and implementation of Ingenio  and so that s not part of our 2020  And quite honestly  we do have the best organic growth in the entire sector over the last several years  and that organic growth is helping our SG A ratio maybe a little bit faster than we had anticipated  So a lot of positives there  really  I think the short answer to your question is  the improvement is going to be a little bit faster in the first couple of years of the five year period versus the last couple of years Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  And I would just add  sort of to reiterate what John has said  we have been intensely focused on operational execution across Anthem  And you re starting to see that  Clearly  system migrations have been successful  being 80  by the end of this year  And our destination platforms allows us a few things  One  leverage on our SG A  but more importantly  improving our business process  making it easier to do business with Anthem  The investments that we are making in digital  our investment levels have been very consistent  And so as you think about our SG A ratio  we re getting leverage from our growth  but we re really getting leverage from reengineering our business processes from an end to end  simplifying our technology infrastructure  And I think that s a huge opportunity for us as we continue to make it easier to do business with Anthem as well as for consumers to have the tools at their fingertips  And that s really where we re heading on this  Thank you very much  Next question OperatorWe will go to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Please go ahead Kevin Fischbeck    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Great  Thanks  I want to go back to the MLR commentary because    I mean  I guess  I appreciate the concept of growing the government business faster and then creating a mix issue  but you are coming in at the higher end of your MLR this year  And usually  we think about the business being repriced  And if you re coming at the higher end of MLR this year  there s an opportunity to improve that going into the following year  So just trying to understand why we re not seeing more of that  And I guess  maybe two questions related to that  First  talk about margin normalization in the individual business  Are we going to be at that normal margin in 2020  Or is this something that s also going to be a headwind in future years  And second  just to understand how Ingenio works with MLR  It sounds like you re saying Ingenio lowered cost trend  but you priced to that cost trend so it s not impacting  one way or the other  the MLR in the quarter  And if you could just break out how much Ingenio did lower trend    what would trend have been without Ingenio John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer No  thank you  Kevin  again  for that question  In terms of the MLR for 2020 in your commentary  mix is extremely important  And yes  we do reprice our business each year  The    we do price very disciplined  Our pricing includes overall cost trend  and we feel very good about the target margins that we have associated with the various lines of business  And Medicaid is going to improve in 2020  as we have talked about  So that s going to be a tailwind  But there are several headwinds to that metric  And again  mix being    and this is on an after HIF basis because HIF really makes all of the metrics confusing on a reported basis  and mix is the single biggest issue  I had referenced in a different question about the individual normalization  That is going to impact our MLR as that comes through  And to answer your side question on individual normalization  given the way the MLR rebate rules work in the 3 year averaging associated with the profitability of that  we do expect that 2020  we ll have individual margins that are within our range  our sustainable range here for the future  Another data point just on the MLR that    I don t know that people have really considered  again  is the elimination of the HIF in 2021  And the fact that our 2020 renewal pricing will not include the gross up for the HIF or the tax nondeductibility to HIF for the period that the contract years go into 2021 reduces premium and increases MLR  All those things combined are what really drives the increase year over year Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Next question  please OperatorWe ll go to Josh Raskin with Nephron  Please go ahead Josh Raskin    Nephron Research LLC    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  Just my question on the opportunity that you guys had potential to work with Prime and their decision to go another route  I m just curious sort of how that unfolded and why you think they decided to sort of do something else  Was there something missing on the Ingenio side  Do you think it was just sort of financial  Or    I m just curious to get your feedback Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks for the question  Josh  In terms of Prime  first  let me talk a little more broadly about our partnership with the Blues  We don t    we re not going to comment on specific decisions that are made or deals that are done  I mean that really  I think  is a broader question that we won t comment on  But I think it s    the bigger issue you re asking is how do we partner with the Blues  And I think that s been    it s absolutely been an important part of our strategy  And looking at that  we feel really good about where we ve been with our partnerships with the Blues  First  in our core business  which is the Medicaid partnerships and the growing Medicare Advantage partnerships that we have that we most recently launched  Those are going very well  And we continue to add more  Our diversified business group  which is a growing part of our portfolio today works with two thirds of the Blue  We re obviously not going to sell everyone every single product we have  But again  we see the Blues as a very strong partnership with us  And actually  most recently  Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey just added one of our core product s health guide to their largest customer  the state of New Jersey  So we ve got    we see strong and growing opportunities in terms of that  And we also think that Ingenio will be a very strong opportunity in the pharmacy space  So we think there s plenty of room across the Blues for us to do partnerships as well as to work with each other  So from that perspective  we re still very bullish on our opportunities across the system  Thanks very much  Next question OperatorWe ll go to Sarah James with Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Sarah James    Piper Sandler    Analyst Thank you  The deceleration to the 4  local group trend  it s the lowest that trend has been for Anthem  Can you unpack that for us  How much is Ingenio versus any other buckets decelerating in there  And then just to clarify  you said that you re pricing to trend  So I want to confirm  does that mean there s no conservative buffer baked into spread in the event that the deceleration from 6  to 4  doesn t come to fruition  Thanks John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Sarah  thank you for the question  And just to clarify  there are many  many things that go into trend  There s the    obviously  the changing population  the acuity of the business  the mix  We have cost of care initiatives that we have implemented in prior years  We have cost of care initiatives that we will implement in 2020  all the impact trend  And then we also have the impact of Ingenio  Just for clarity  we are not going to itemize each one of those and what they are each worth individually  In aggregate  it takes our trend down to 4   And that compares to the fact that we ended 2019 squarely at the midpoint of our prior trend of 6   plus or minus 50 basis points  And now we have a 4   In terms of pricing methodology  the pricing methodology does have a bit of conservatism baked into it  but it s not a percent or a number that we re going to talk about here  but we feel very good about our ability to deliver on the pricing discipline that we ve laid out Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  And I ll just reiterate what John said  We have not changed anything around our pricing discipline  We ve remained exactly consistent on that to our forward view of costs  and that s how we re pricing  And then in terms of just a couple of factors  because I think everyone is focusing on just IngenioRx and the impact on trend  We have also been working very diligently around how do we change overall costs  And right now  60  of our spend is in risk based arrangements  We expect to see greater pull through of that because more an upside  downside risk where we think there is the best alignment of cost quality and healthcare outcomes  We are very focused on bundled payments and incentives for site of care  working around orthopedics  cardiac  women s health services  Our site of service  where we work with our DBG counterparts around    particularly our aim around moving to the appropriate site of service  I think  is another really important area around GI  great area that we re focused on right now  And then finally  specialty Rx  where we re targeted for redirection in that area  So those are all large dollar areas and big areas of trend in spend  And we have been intensely focused on that as part of our overall medical cost management and alignment of those services as well as what Ingenio brings to us on just a unit cost perspective  Thanks very much for the question  Next question  please OperatorThat will be Lance Wilkes with Bernstein  Please go ahead Lance Wilkes    Sanford C  Bernstein    Analyst Yeah  Could you talk a little bit about the improvements in Medicaid in 4Q and the second half  And in particular  you point to kind of specific actions you ve taken  And then how much of that improvement is coming on the medical cost side versus operating expenses Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks for the question  Lance  I m going to have Felicia Norwood respond Felicia Norwood    President of our Government Business Division Good morning  Lance  and thanks for the question  As you know  we have spent the    a big part of 2019 focused on working with our state partners to make sure that we were getting rates that were aligned with the acuity and mix of our membership  We saw acceleration of reverifications during 2019  And as you know  that provided some headwinds for us  We are pleased to say that as we head into 2020  we have spent a lot of time with our state partners to get the rates that we believe are appropriate for the mix and acuity of the population that we re serving  At the end of the day  it s all about a combination of rates  but also the medical management programs that we have in place as well to support our members  We say all the time  and it s true  we re very focused on whole person care  We have worked very closely with complex and specialized populations and making sure that our members are getting care in the most appropriate setting  So when we think about the opportunity we have for us on the Medicaid side around improving our overall cost as we go forward  is certainly a combination of having in place the right medical management programs and being very disciplined and vigilant with our state partners around getting the rates that we need to support the changing mix of our population as we go forward Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Next question  please OperatorWe ll go to Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets  Please go ahead Matthew Borsch    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Yeah  Could you just talk a little bit about the outlook on the commercial side  I mean  I heard your broad comments  but how do you expect to start this year in terms of your commercial enrollment  particularly on the risk side when we think about group versus individual  given the trends that you re seeing Pete Haytaian    President  Commercial and Specialty Business Division Yes  Thanks  Matt  As we talked about    we talked about a large client transitioning from fully insured to ASO  So at the beginning of the year  you will see that play through  But as we talked about  through the remaining portion of the year  you ll see our fully insured business continues to improve and grow for all the reasons that we stated before  And as it relates to the individual business  and I think that you know  we saw modest growth this year  We believe in our strategy around individual  We remain disciplined with respect to that business  We re targeting markets where we can achieve the appropriate economics and establish the right networks  have the right collaborative relationship with providers and partners  And we re seeing that play through  but it s a very methodical and thoughtful approach  And so I think you ll see  as it relates to 2020  our individual business play out in a very similar fashion than it did in 2019 Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Next question  please OperatorWe ll go to Dave Windley with Jefferies  Please go ahead Dave Windley    Jefferies    Analyst Hi  Thank you for taking my question  I wanted to come back to MLR  I apologize  But on MLR  looking at kind of  if I extend out maybe one more decimal point  it looks like MLR really was kind of outside    barely  but outside of your range for the year  And the risk adjustment  if I take that out  would really bring you back down to still at the very high end of your MLR range for the year  So you ve  I think  said that the trends were basically in line with expectations  but for flu  So I m wondering if you could quantify flu  so we could have a better sense of the magnitude of that in the fourth quarter and for the fourth quarter of next year  understand what the year over year compare would be on that John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Dave  thank you for the question  And quite honestly  I m not going to comment on decimal points that go out further and further and further  I really don t think that it s a productive conversation  However  I will say that the flu was more significant in the month of December  specifically  in November  but in the fourth quarter in total than we had anticipated  there s obviously a lot of factors that go into MLR and premium and everything else  And we re going to talk about the things that are material and significant  not the ones that change things by 100 basis points    100th of a basis point or something like that  So our answers stand  that we believe we have provided the information that s needed Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Next question  please OperatorThat will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen  Please go ahead Charles Rhyee    Cowen and Company    Analyst Yeah  Thanks  Hey  just    thanks for taking the questions  Just want to clarify a couple of things  First  going back to MLR  not so much about the guidance range itself  The 50 basis points range is a little bit wider than normal  Is that just simply as you kind of take on Missouri and Nebraska  Or is there anything else in sort of the variation that you re kind of expecting  And then secondly  I think to an earlier question  you re obviously going to a 4  cost trend from 6   You talked about it largely being Ingenio and a few other things  But without Ingenio  what would that six    how would we compare that 6  compared to  19 John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Charles  And in terms of the guidance range and expanding the MLR by 50 basis points  it s really the    to be more consistent with how others in the industry have expressed trend over the last several years as well as the fact that we continue to be a growing company with some really good top line growth and want to provide guidance that we don t have to revise and change maybe as much as we had on the MLR basis for the future  And then in terms of the Ingenio is  as in response to Sarah s question  we re not going to provide the specific itemization of each item and trend and how much medical management worth  how much site of care is worth  how much bundled payments are worth or how much Ingenio s for that matter  on the trend on a percentage basis Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Next question OperatorWe ll go to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets  Please go ahead Frank Morgan    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Good morning  A lot of questions of the impact of the mix shift on your overall MLR  I m just curious  could you give us a high level thought around what s the differential in that target market    margin in those two businesses  the government  the commercial  And then in terms of your assumptions around the Nebraska  Missouri contracts  where are they relative to your government contract margins to our targeted margins  And have states been through these reverification cycles  Thanks John Gallina    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Frank  this is John  I ll start out on the question and then turn it over to Felicia to provide some final thoughts  But if you look at the government business division in terms of how it has contributed to the revenue of Anthem for 2018 and 2019  it s been slightly more than 60  for each year  But now when you look into 2020 and you look at our Medicaid growth  including Missouri and Nebraska  you look at our sustained double digit growth in Medicare Advantage  which  on a percentage basis  has led the industry for several years in a row  the fact that the return of the HIF is muting the fully insured commercial growth  you take it all in  we expect that government revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue by several percentage points  And just the dynamic on that ends up being the leading factor associated with the increase in the MLR year over year  Felicia  if you d like to talk about Missouri and Nebraska Felicia Norwood    President of our Government Business Division Yeah  First of all  let me say that we re very excited for the opportunity to be able to serve Medicaid beneficiaries and working with state partners in Missouri and Nebraska  Just to level set again  reverifications and eligibility determinations are a part of a normal course of business in Medicaid programs  and states are required to verify eligibility at least annually  We have not    certainly  we just closed last week  but we certainly haven t seen anything yet with respect to this population around accelerated reverifications  but we will work closely with our state partners there as we take on this business and bring the value of Anthem to beneficiaries in the state  Thank you  Next question  please OperatorWe ll go to Whit Mayo with UBS  Please go ahead Whit Mayo    UBS    Analyst Hey  thanks  Just a quick one on Medicare Advantage  You picked up about 90 000 lives in open enrollment  and at the midpoint of your guidance range of 150 000 to 200 000 implies half of the growth coming this year from open enrollment alone  But historically  you ve earned perhaps a third given the year round D SNP growth and group wins  So what s different this year as we think about the seasonality of your expected growth since history makes us look pretty low as a starting point Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you for the question  Yes  we re very  very pleased about what we saw during the AEP season  Frankly  it was some of the strongest growth we ve ever seen  And we look forward to being able to continue to grow our business over the course of the year  As you know  we are focused very much  not just on our MA population but also duals as well  and we are consistently bringing in business with respect to that over the course of the year  The fourth year in a row of exceeding the industry growth rates with respect to MA has been very significant for us  We spent a lot of time focused with our partners and also focused on our product portfolio  And when we think about the competitive product portfolio we have and the supplemental benefit offerings  we feel that we are well positioned for growth as we go forward  So if you think about it  we are very much committed to being able to deliver on the commitment we ve made  which is to deliver mid double digit growth again in 2020  Next question  please OperatorThat will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead George Hill    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Good morning  guys  and thanks for taking my question  John  I just want to delve into a comment you made in the prepared commentary  It sounded like you were talking about in the    from the risk based business to the fee based business  you re seeing kind of the profit ratio go from five to one to three to one  I guess  can you unpack that a little bit  I m assuming it s the growth in the profit of the fee based business as opposed to a shrinkage in the profit of the risk based business  And I guess  can you talk about what s driving the incremental profitability of the fee based business and kind of allowing you to generate that margin Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Sure  This is Gail  I think that was in my commentary  I will    I ll ask Pete to comment  That s a strategy that we ve shared pretty broadly as part of investor day in terms of improving the profitability of our fee based business relative to the industry  So we feel very good about the profitability of our fully insured  So it s not a decline there  It s more of an improvement  But I ll let Pete talk about the specific actions underneath that Pete Haytaian    President  Commercial and Specialty Business Division Yes  exactly  So this is a    it s a    as we talked about at investor day  it s a major component in our growth strategy in terms of expanding and    expanding our margins and improving our ASO business overall  And to unpack how we achieved that  it s through a series of upselling in terms of capabilities and programs  So specifically  as Gail noted  our specialty business this year performed exceptionally well  growing by over 1 million members  That s a component  upselling our specialty products into our ASO business  Stop losses included as well  Clinical programs  where we re seeing very significant uptick  And Gail mentioned in the prepared comments  programs like Total health  total you  All these things are playing into success with respect to this  And then longer term and into 2020  we look really forward to including IngenioRx  In that context  that will be a significant driver of taking us to the three to one as we committed to and even forward looking  thinking about future assets like Beacon will continue to create improvements as well  So we remain really bullish with respect to this story and on a path to success to meet our commitments by 2023 Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Next question  please OperatorWe ll go to Scott Fidel of Stephens  Please go ahead Scott Fidel    Stephens Inc     Analyst Hi  Just had a follow up question just on the commentary around North Carolina  And you had mentioned that you expect that will now be a 2021 event in terms of implementation  Just interested because a couple of your peers have talked more to want to talk to a 3Q start  another had talked to a 4Q start  So just interested whether you ve actually gotten some recent feedback from the state telling you it s going to be more like 2021 or whether you re just being    trying to be a little conservative around that assumption  Just remind us in terms of what your pick was in terms of what you re expecting on North Carolina membership whenever that actually does get implemented  Thanks Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  good morning and thank you for the question  First and foremost  let me say that we are very much looking forward to working with our state partner and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina in order to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state  We were here in the last quarter  we expected the business to go live on February 1st  Based on everything we know today  and I will say we have not had a definitive answer from the state  we are assuming that in order to be able to deliver on the business  it would take until possibly 2021 before you would be able to go live with respect to the contract  With that said  I will say that we have been very much working closely with our partner in the state of North Carolina  and we are ready today  Operational readiness is critical for us  and we have gone through numerous iterations with the state around testing and preparedness for the go live  But based on where we are sitting today  it s our expectation that the business won t be going live until 2021  Next question  please OperatorAnd our final question will be from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research  Please go ahead Steve Willoughby    Cleveland Research    Analyst Hi  Thanks for squeezing me here at the end  Gail  just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on two different items  One  just as it relates to the acquisition  It sounds like it s dependent of the TPA you mentioned  Just why that interests you in actually acquiring that business  And then also  if you could provide any color as it relates to something you mentioned back at the analyst meeting  As it relates to the Blue s high performing network for 2021  And maybe just an update on how you are thinking about that for Anthem and maybe the Blues network overall  Thank you Gail Boudreaux    President and Chief Executive Officer Great  Thank you for the two questions  And first  in terms of the TPA acquisition  It s a capability acquisition  predominantly for us  The reason we re interested  we re the majority of the membership today  it is a subsegment of the business that requires a different type of flexibility we ve been very focused  obviously  on converting our systems to having a destination platform in our commercial business  This gives us a little more flexibility around subsegments of the market that we do business in  hospital labor  etc   that historically has different sort of operating requirements  So we felt that this was    this added to our portfolio  It s an area that the Blues have always been strong in and this specific TPA  again  is the majority of ours and works closely with the other Blue partners  So we feel good about that  In terms of the second question  the high performing network  Sorry  I was just catching up there a little bit on it  We re actually making great progress  We re really excited about it  It s part of our overall affordability  We re working with our other Blue partners  I think it s actually a very strong statement around what we re trying to do with high performing networks and 55 MSAs  22 of which are in Anthem states  We believe that this will provide us with    leverage our deep provider relationships and allow us to seamlessly and simplify how our customers get a significant cost structure advantage and much higher outcomes  Overall  it s progressing  We ve had great interest from our largest clients  particularly national clients  As you know  we ve always had a very strong unit cost advantage inside of the Blue Cross system  This is  I think  builds upon that also to have a very strong performance orientation and the network  again  is built based on both cost and quality  And so we have selected those care providers within our networks who are delivering truly superior outcomes  And I think it aligns very well with our value based initiatives  And what I also like about this as Blues across the country  we re building a very consistent set of outcome metrics for our clients  And that  again  is resonating very strongly  So thank you very much for that question  We re obviously very excited about the partnership and the opportunity there  Let me now thank you very much for joining our call this morning  As you can see  2019 has been a strong year for Anthem across our enterprise  I m pleased with our performance  but we have much more work to do as we move into the new year  We ll continue to focus on our performance execution in order to drive growth and create a better healthcare experience for everyone we serve  We ll also continue to evolve our culture and further build our talent and capabilities to create positive change across our organization and in the communities where we live and work  I look forward to delivering another strong performance in the year ahead and want to thank all of our associates for their very good work  Thank you OperatorLadies and gentlemen  this conference will be

The Herald accessed the video in an Instagram story posted by a real estate agent for a Russian American firm that frequents Mar a Lago  The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comments from the paper  which sent along copies of the video  But the president has made his stance clear before  telling Fox   Friends in 2018   You have to stand  proudly  for the national anthem  or you shouldn t be playing  You shouldn t be there  Maybe you shouldn t be in the country    And  of course  his more ardent supporters have espoused the same belief  In fact  Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren called out a famous couple opting to sit during the very same performance of the national anthem over the weekend 

Beyonc    Jay Z  former crack dealer sit for the national anthem because apparently the United States of America has oppressed them with millions upon millions of dollars   fans  Sounds rough  Maybe they should try another country that allows them a little more freedom   success   Tomi Lahren   TomiLahren  February 3  2020

190795,412311,ANTM,Why Anthem Stock Lost 12  in January,news,"What happened
Anthem  NYSE ANTM  shareholders underperformed the market last month as their investment shed 12  compared to a roughly flat result for the S P 500  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence 
The drop added to recent losses for investors  with shares gaining only 15  in 2019  or about half the broader market s return for the year 

So what
January s decline came following the health insurance giant s fiscal fourth quarter report  That announcement met expectations in terms of membership growth and earnings gains  However  investors chose to focus instead on the conservative outlook that Anthem issued for the 2020 year 
Now what
CEO Gail Boudreaux and her executive team see medical membership rising to around 42 million people from 41 million in 2019  helping push revenue to  117 billion compared to  103 billion  The healthcare giant is expecting a few unusual costs  though  which should pressure earnings in 2020  While they watch for signs that this expense boost is only temporary  investors this year are bracing for volatility around the U S  presidential election  in which the healthcare industry is likely to feature prominently for candidates proposing sweeping changes to companies  business models ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptdfn,2080736

190798,412314,ANTM,Anthem  ANTM  Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Anthem  NYSE ANTM  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 88 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 90 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 44 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  0 51   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of  4 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 87  delivering a surprise of 0 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Anthem  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  27 13 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 04   This compares to year ago revenues of  23 30 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Anthem shares have lost about 3 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 4  
What s Next for Anthem 
While Anthem has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Anthem was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

of  3 62  and the company used the strong number to back a dividend increase of nearly 19   to 95 cents per share  It was the fourth dividend raise in the last three years  and brings the yield to 1

190800,412316,ANTM,Royal Caribbean liability for volcano deaths may turn on  act of God  defense,news,"By Tom Hals
 Reuters    Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd s potential liability for a deadly excursion to a volcanic island in New Zealand could hinge on whether the eruption was an unforeseeable  act of God   according to maritime lawyers 
Cruise ship passengers were among the tourists on White Island on Monday when it erupted  While no lawsuits have yet been filed  legal experts said they expected action in U S courts by injured passengers and families of those who died 
There were 47 people on the island at the time  Eight have been officially declared dead and more than 20 are being treated for severe burns  The New Zealand military was carrying out an operation to recover eight other bodies still on the island 
Royal Caribbean ticket terms posted on its website spell out that the company is not liable for any injury  death or loss of property caused by an act of God  as well as war  terrorism or other events beyond the company s control 
Royal Caribbean will likely argue the disaster was an extraordinary event no one could reasonably foresee  said Robert Kritzman  an attorney with Baker Donelson in Miami 
 If a volcano were to erupt  clearly that isn t negligence on anyone s part  that s nature   said Kritzman  a former general counsel with Norwegian Cruise Line 
Royal Caribbean did not respond to questions about missing passengers or whether it told passengers of the risks of visiting the island 
 We grieve this tragic loss  We will to continue to offer our support and services to the families during this difficult time   the company said in an email 
Part of the case will turn on what the cruise line knew or should have known and what they told passengers about indications of increased volcanic activity 
 There are tremors  there are earthquakes and people monitor that   said Carlos Llin s Negret  an attorney with Nelson   Fraenkel who represents passengers   It all depends on what the cruise knew  and when they knew it  
Geological hazard tracker GeoNet raised the alert level for the White Island volcano in November and said on Dec  3 that  the volcano may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal  
The cruise line described White Island as  one of the most active volcanoes in the world   according to a cached version of its website   Get close to the drama  Gas masks help you get near roaring steam vents  bubbling pits of mud  hot volcanic streams and the amazing lake of steaming acid   it promised 
Virginia parents of one woman who was severely burned told a TV station that her daughter said she believed Royal Caribbean would not have let her visit the island if it were not safe 
The experts said in a typical shore excursion accident the cruise line tries to put blame on the third party that is hired to run the tour  On its website  Royal Caribbean does not identify the company that ran the White Island excursion 
Passengers would have to show Royal Caribbean did not take proper care to vet the operator  lawyers said 
But lawsuits face the added challenge of overcoming the argument the eruption was unforeseeable 
Norwegian Cruise Line was able to fend off a class action lawsuit about a large  freak wave  hitting one of its ships in 2005 by arguing it was an unforeseeable event  Regulators had concluded there was no wrongdoing by Norwegian 
Royal Caribbean is using the act of God defense against a class action about a powerful storm in 2016 that hit the ship Anthem  NYSE ANTM  of the Seas off the eastern United States  Passengers said the company knew of the risks of the storm  but tried to outrun it 
The dramatic description of the White Island tour on Royal Caribbean s website will likely be a focus of any lawsuit  with lawyers seizing on it to show the company knew a disaster was possible  legal experts said  The company could argue passengers were fully informed of the dangers and received proper safety equipment 
 If they hand out gas masks that says automatically you know you have a risk   said Bob Parks  a Miami attorney who represents passengers ",2019-12-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/royal-caribbean-liability-for-volcano-deaths-may-turn-on-act-of-god-defense-2040367,2040367

190802,412318,ANTM,Exclusive  Malware broker behind U S  hacks is now teaching computer skills in China,news, This Dec 24 story adds additional LONDON dateline   By Steve Stecklow and Alexandra Harney LONDON SHANGHAI  Reuters    A Chinese malware broker who was sentenced in the United States this year for dealing in malicious software linked to major hacks is back at his old workplace  teaching high school computer courses  including one on internet security  Yu Pingan  who spent 18 months in a San Diego federal detention center  had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer hacking  A high school instructor  he had been arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in August 2017 upon arriving with a group of teachers to observe a U S  university  A Reuters reporter found him teaching at his old school here last month  Yu was sentenced by a federal judge in February to time served and allowed to return to China  The victims of the hacking conspiracy included microchip supplier Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  aerospace and defense firm Pacific Scientific Energetic Materials Co  and gaming company Riot Games  according to the judgment  Exactly what was stolen in the computer breaches wasn t disclosed in public court filings  Qualcomm declined to comment  A Riot Games spokesman said the company lost no data  Pacific Scientific didn t respond to requests for comment  Yu specializes in computer network security and programming  according to court records  The malware he provided in the conspiracy included a rare software tool called Sakula that granted hackers remote control over computers  It s unclear who authored the malware or how Yu obtained it  Sakula has been linked to some of the most notorious cyber attacks of the decade  In addition to the intrusions detailed in the case against Yu  these include hacks of U S  health insurer Anthem  NYSE ANTM  Inc  where millions of patient records were exposed  and the U S  Office of Personnel Management  in which the personal information of millions of current and former U S  government employees and contractors was compromised  Yu wasn t accused of involvement in those two breaches  His prosecution was one of a series of criminal cases against Chinese nationals Washington has brought in recent years  in response to what the Americans say is a concerted campaign by China s military and security ministry to steal technology from Western companies  In another case involving Sakula malware  the U S  last year alleged that two Chinese intelligence officers and a team of recruited hackers repeatedly intruded into Western companies  computer systems for more than five years  Many of the Chinese defendants in the series of hacking cases haven t been apprehended  Yu is one of the few alleged Chinese hackers to have been arrested and convicted in the U S  crackdown  In addition to jail time  Yu was ordered to pay nearly  1 1 million in restitution to five companies that were victims of the hacking  The fine was to be paid in installments of  100 a month  with no interest  according to the judgment  The payment schedule would take more than 900 years to complete  Jeremy Warren  a San Diego criminal defense attorney who represented Yu  said   With a Chinese national  a school teacher  there s no real expectation of payment   Yu s 18 months in federal prison  he said  was no  walk in the park   China s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had  no understanding  of the Yu case   We resolutely oppose any type of cyber attack  and we investigate and crack down on any cyber attack occurring inside China or making use of Chinese internet infrastructure   the ministry spokesperson s office said  The ministry added that it had no knowledge of other cases alleging Chinese hacking of U S  companies  and it accused Washington of displaying a  cold war mentality  in its tech related prosecutions  Yu  according to court filings by U S  prosecutors  went by the nickname  Goldsun   He was accused of conspiring with other Chinese individuals to use malware to hack into the computer networks of companies in the U S  and elsewhere  An affidavit from Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Adam James alleged that Yu provided Sakula and other malware used in the case  Citing seized communications between Yu and two unindicted co conspirators  James alleged that Yu had installed  an unauthorized backdoor  on an unidentified company s computer network to gain remote access  The conspirators  cyber intrusions included so called  watering hole attacks   in which malicious software infects the computers of visitors to compromised websites   This is akin to a predator waiting to ambush prey at the location the prey goes to drink water   a court document stated  Last month  Reuters found Yu  who is 39  teaching at Shanghai Commercial School  a state run vocational technical high school in central Shanghai  U S  officials told Reuters that Yu had been teaching there prior to his arrest  Digital signs outside classrooms indicated Yu was teaching at least two basic computer courses  including one called  Basic English for Internet Security   One of his former students  a computer science major who is now in China s military  said he couldn t answer questions about Yu because of  political reasons  and that the school had instructed him not to discuss the matter  On Nov  1  a Reuters reporter saw Yu at an office on the school s campus  Dressed in a red and blue plaid Oxford shirt  he declined to answer questions  Yu called a school official  who arrived with a security guard and escorted the reporter off the campus  The school official called Yu s situation a private matter   It s his own experience  and it has nothing to do with the school   she said   Reported by Steve Stecklow in London and Alexandra Harney in Shanghai  Additional reporting by Emily Chow in Shanghai and the Beijing and Shanghai Newsrooms

190809,412325,ANTM,NFL notebook  Dolphins fire offensive line coach,news,"The Miami Dolphins fired offensive line coach Pat Flaherty in the first week of training camp  promoting analyst Dave DeGuglielmo into the role Monday 
The NFL Network s Ian Rapoport tweeted that  Flaherty struggled to implement the new system  and it s been an issue since the spring  It s why DeGuglielmo was brought in  
Offensive line is among the biggest concerns for new head coach Brian Flores  who is taking over after the team went 7 9 last season 
Flaherty  63  has been an offensive line coach in the NFL since the 2004 season  when he joined the New York Giants under coach Tom Coughlin  DeGuglielmo  51  is in his third stint on Miami s coaching staff  having served as offensive line coach from 2009 11 and in 2017  He spent last season with the Indianapolis Colts  where he was fired in January 
  Cam Newton is on a pitch count in training camp  recovering from offseason shoulder surgery and an injury he now says should have kept him on the sideline 
But with the Carolina Panthers fighting for a possible wild card spot last year  Newton said he felt it was his job as the quarterback of the Carolina Panthers to be on the field 
 I felt as if I wanted to give my team everything that I had honestly   Newton said in an interview with Peter King   Being hurt  being injured     looking back at it  it probably wasn t the smartest  efficient thing  knowing that I left it all out there on the field  And if you asked me if I d do it again  I d do it again  
  Washington Redskins safety Landon Collins shifted the figurative bull s eye on the New York Giants to a more literal one 
In a live interview with NFL Network s Mike Garafolo  the former Giants safety said he would run over New York general manager Dave Gettleman if he got too close on the sidelines during pregame 
Collins called Gettleman a  liar  earlier this offseason and hasn t tempered his emotions since  He expected to be tagged as the Giants  franchise player in February but was allowed to enter free agency  where he signed a six year   84 million deal with Washington 
  Former first round defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche  who was released Saturday by the Arizona Cardinals  cleared waivers and became a free agent 
Any team that claimed him off waivers would assume the  1 6 million remaining on the final year of his contract  The Cardinals let him go before Nkemdiche was due a  400 000 bonus had he been on the roster on the fifth day of camp 
Nkemdiche  who turns 25 in September  had been on the physically unable to perform list as he continues to recover from a December tear of his ACL  but he reported to camp last week in poor shape

  Cameron Meredith was released by the New Orleans Saints  The 26 year old wide receiver had signed a two year   9 5 million offer sheet with the Saints as a restricted free agent of the Chicago Bears in 2018 
Meredith never regained his pre injury form following a torn ACL in the 2017 preseason with the Bears  He played in six games with the Saints last season but was not a participant in organized team activities or minicamp due to issues with his knee 
  The New England Patriots restructured right tackle Marcus Cannon s contract  according to NFL Network 
Cannon  31  now has  4 5 million in guaranteed money for this season  per the report  The Patriots also reportedly added incentives that could boost the total value of his contract

Reid  who joined the Panthers three weeks into the 2018 season  kneeled before every game last season  although no Panthers teammates joined him 
  Quarterback Vincent Testaverde  whose father was the No  1 pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1987  signed with the Bucs 
The younger Testaverde started his college career at Texas Tech and then moved on to his father s alma mater  Miami  before ending up at Albany  In one season with the Great Danes  he started eight games and threw for 1 714 yards and 11 touchdowns while completing 53 4 percent of his passes

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Anthem shares have lost about 0 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for Anthem 
While Anthem has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Anthem was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

190831,412347,ANTM,Can Anthem  ANTM  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Anthem  NYSE ANTM   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This health insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 78  
For the most recent quarter  Anthem was expected to post earnings of  4 61 per share  but it reported  4 64 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 65   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  5 86 per share  while it actually produced  6 03 per share  a surprise of 2 90  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Anthem lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Anthem has an Earnings ESP of  3 98  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-anthem-antm-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200469970,200469970
190832,412348,ANTM,Anthem  ANTM  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Anthem  NYSE ANTM  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27  
Revenues are expected to be  25 41 billion  up 10 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Anthem 
For Anthem  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 54  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Anthem will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Anthem would post earnings of  4 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 64  delivering a surprise of  0 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line

190834,412350,ANTM,U S  healthcare stocks drop after judge rules Obamacare unconstitutional,news,By Manojna Maddipatla and Daniel Wiessner  Reuters    Shares of U S  health insurers  hospitals and healthcare companies fell on Monday in the aftermath of a ruling by a federal judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act  ACA   commonly called Obamacare  was unconstitutional  Many legal experts predicted U S  District Judge Reed O Connor s decision on Friday eventually will be reversed on appeal considering that the law has been upheld by the Supreme Court  but the uncertainty created by the ruling drove down healthcare stocks on Monday  O Connor agreed with a coalition of Republican officials from 20 states that Obamacare was unconstitutional based on its mandate requiring that Americans obtain medical insurance  The judge refused the states  request to issue an injunction immediately blocking 2010 law that was championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama from being enforced  The White House on Friday said the law would remain in effect pending any appeal   The fall in healthcare stocks pulled the broader S P 500 managed health care index  down 2 5 percent   Centene  Corp  N CNC  fell 7 8 percent to  117 5  while Molina Healthcare  N MOH  slumped 10 1 percent to  118 4  The companies are among the health insurers with exposure to ACA  WellCare Health Plans  N WCG  and Anthem Inc  N ANTM  declined 4 7 percent and 2 1 percent  respectively  Brokerage BMO Capital Markets said it expects Centene and Molina to be most affected by the ruling  as they have the highest ACA exposure  which the broker measures as an  estimate of the percentage of company revenue and earnings driven by Obamacare exchanges and or the Medicaid expansion   referring to the government insurance program for lower income people   While we are disappointed in the recent Northern District of Texas court s ACA ruling  we recognize that this is a first step in what will be a lengthy appeals process   Molina Healthcare said    Regardless  the ACA will remain in effect for 2019  and we are optimistic that it will remain in effect thereafter   The ACA required that all individuals have health insurance or pay a tax and also included payments worth billions of dollars to health insurers to subsidize insurance for low income Americans  The Republican led Congress last year eliminated a penalty that the ACA levied on people who opted not to obtain insurance  Obamacare expanded by millions the number of Americans with medical insurance  Republicans  including President Donald Trump  have long criticized the law  calling it a costly and unneeded government intrusion into Americans  lives  About 11 8 million people nationwide enrolled in 2018 Obamacare insurance plans   Republican state officials  led by the attorney general of Texas  filed a lawsuit last year arguing that getting rid of the penalty rendered the mandate unconstitutional  The Trump administration declined to defend the mandate  spurring Democratic officials in 16 states to intervene   WITHSTOOD SCRUTINY  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement said the Democrats would appeal Friday s decision   The ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court   he said   Most legal experts do not believe the Supreme Court would ultimately strike down the entire law  but the uncertainty could pressure stocks in the near term  brokerage Oppenheimer said  The ruling  if affirmed  would have a draconian impact on the healthcare sector and the overhang alone could trigger widespread selling across the sector  Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said  Most legal experts  including conservatives who oppose the mandate  believe the portion of O Connor s ruling striking down the entire law will be reversed   Without the penalty that Congress eliminated last year  the ACA s individual mandate is  largely toothless  and not essential to the remainder of the law  said Ilya Somin  a law professor at George Mason University in Virginia  The Supreme Court in 2012 ruled that the individual mandate was a valid exercise of Congress  taxation powers  with the law imposing a monetary penalty on people who did not obtain insurance  In Friday s decision  O Connor said that because Congress lowered the penalty to zero last year  the mandate no longer came with a  tax  and is unconstitutional  But the judge also held that because the ACA is not financially viable without the mandate  the entire law had to be struck down  Experts said the problem with O Connor s ruling is that Congress last year eliminated the penalty without repealing the entire law  That shows lawmakers believed the law could stand without the mandate  said Nicholas Bagley  a professor at University of Michigan Law School  But some experts noted that when Congress passed the ACA in 2010  lawmakers acknowledged that the requirement that insurers provided coverage for pre existing medical conditions had to be paired with the mandate in order to work  Enforcing the remainder of the law without the mandate  creates a death spiral where rates will go out of control   said Josh Blackman  a professor at South Texas College of Law whose work O Connor cited in Friday s ruling  Other experts have pointed out what they said was a more fundamental problem with O Connor s ruling  the states did not have the standing to sue in the first place  Without the financial penalty in place  the mandate does not cause any harm that can form the basis of a lawsuit  Bagley said

190835,412351,ANTM,Sign ups for 2019 Obamacare insurance fall to 8 5 million people,news,"By Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    The number of Americans who signed up for 2019 insurance plans created by the Affordable Care Act  often called Obamacare  fell by about 4 percent to 8 5 million people from 2018  the U S  government said on Wednesday   Enrollment had been running about 10 percent lower but picked up during the past week  reflecting a typical trend of last minute shopping  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  Administrator Seema Verma said in a call with reporters  Verma said the decrease was due to increased employment  which typically means more people had employer based health insurance  and that about 100 000 people with Obamacare insurance in Virginia became eligible for the expanded Medicaid program there   Wall Street analysts had expected a decline in the federal Obamacare marketplace and had cited competing insurance options  a cut in advertising spending from the previous administration to promote the program and the removal of the law s individual mandate that had required people to have health insurance or pay a fine  Verma said those changes had not had an impact on enrollment   We see no correlation between what we are seeing on advertising and effectuated enrollment   she said  As of Dec  15 at midnight EST  8 454 882 people had signed up for plans  she said  But those numbers are not final  The marketplace was open for three additional hours and continues to try to reach 200 000 people who were unable to complete their enrollment by the deadline  she said  The agency runs enrollment through the online marketplace  HealthCare gov  for 39 states   Enrollment closed just one day after a ruling from a federal judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act  ACA  was unconstitutional  setting off a cascade of worries about the future of these plans and other key tenets of the law  such as the expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor   But there is no immediate impact on the plans in 2019  Legal experts and Wall Street analysts have said that an appeal will stretch into next year and that if the ruling were to be upheld  it would likely move to another appeal at the Supreme Court in 2020  The figures reported on Wednesday do not include data for the other 11 states plus Washington D C  which run their own individual insurance marketplaces and set their own enrollment closing dates  California  for instance  closes enrollment on Jan  15  2019  Those 11 states make up about 25 percent of enrollment  which was about 11 8 million across the country at the beginning of 2018  a decline of about 400 000 people from 2017  Private insurers including  Centene  Corp   N CNC   Molina Healthcare  N MOH  and Anthem Inc  N ANTM   offer individual Obamacare plans  though it is a small portion of their overall business  The Texas court decision late on Friday pushed down shares of those companies as investors took account of the new risk to insurers who provide individual insurance and Medicaid coverage  The ACA is widely considered to be the signature domestic achievement of former President Barack Obama   Republicans in Congress failed to overturn it through legislation  despite being pushed to do so by U S  President Donald Trump  But the administration has been able to take away some of its provisions and introduced new rules to bolster competing plans  It has also cut advertising and services to promote the Obamacare plans  
The new plans are attractive to individuals who do not qualify for income based government subsidies that make Obamacare plans more affordable  Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said in a recent note ",2018-12-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/signups-for-2019-obamacare-insurance-fall-to-85-million-people-1726753,1726753

190844,412360,ANTM,Should Value Investors Choose Anthem  ANTM  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fairvalue One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Anthem has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 2  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 53  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Anthem s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 15 61 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 01  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Anthem has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 17  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Anthem s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Anthem has a P S ratio of about 0 74  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 11 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Anthem currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Anthem a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Anthem is just 1 01  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 20  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Anthem might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of B  This gives ANTM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen nine upward revision in the past sixty days compared to no downward revision  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen five upward revision compared to two downwardrevisions in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate increased 0 36  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate rose 0 08   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Anthem  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a long term EPS growth rate of 14  and favorable estimate trends has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAnthem is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the Zacks Rank  2 company flaunts a robust industry rank  among the top 8    which indicates that the broader factors are favorable for the company So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Anthem shares have added about 15 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Anthem 
While Anthem has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Anthem was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

190855,412371,ANTM,Why Anthem  ANTM  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Anthem  NYSE ANTM   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this health insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 6 91   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Anthem came out with earnings of  6 03 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 86 per share  representing a surprise of 2 90   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 20 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 44 per share  delivering a surprise of 10 91  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Anthem  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Anthem currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 29   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 24  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-anthem-antm-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200439344,200439344

The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Anthem is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Anthem imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Anthem
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this health insurer is expected to earn  19 29 per share  which is a change of 21 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Anthem  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

190876,412392,ANTM,Senate aims for a  skinny  Obamacare repeal as other options fail,news,"By Susan Cornwell and Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    Republican U S  Senate leaders  struggling to keep a seven year promise to end Obamacare  turned their focus on Wednesday to passing a slimmed down  skinny  repeal measure that would throw the issue into negotiations with the House of Representatives  The last ditch effort came after senators voted 55 45 against a straight repeal of Obamacare  which would have provided for a two year delay in implementation to give Congress time to work out a replacement  Seven Republicans opposed the measure  It was the Senate s second failure in 24 hours to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  which expanded health insurance to about 20 million people  many of them low income  On Tuesday  senators rejected the repeal and replace plan Republicans had worked on since May  The failures underscored the party s deep divisions on the role of government in helping provide access to healthcare as the Senate conducted its second day of a freewheeling debate that could stretch through the week  Republicans said they were still working out what would be in a skinny repeal  which could simply eliminate mandates requiring individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance  and abolish a tax on medical device manufacturers  Senator John Thune  the No  3 Senate Republican  said the party was trying to  figure out what the traffic will bear  in terms of getting 50 of our members to vote for things that will repeal as much of Obamacare as possible   Republicans hold a 52 48 majority in the Senate  Any Senate legislation would be enough to kick the issue to a special negotiating committee with the House  which passed its own version in May  If that panel can agree on a new bill  the full House and Senate  both controlled by Republicans  would again have to approve the legislation   a process that could last months   I think people would look at it not necessarily based on its content  but as a forcing mechanism to cause the two sides of the building to try to solve it together   Republican Senator Bob Corker said   That s going to be the last chance   Senator John Cornyn  the No  2 Senate Republican  told reporters there was growing support for a slimmed down approach that would kick the can to negotiators   I think there is plenty of agreement   he said  SEEKING  MORE ORGANIZED PROCESS  President Donald Trump has come down hard on his fellow Republicans for failing to act on Obamacare  something he promised repeatedly to repeal and replace in his election campaign last year  Some Senate Republicans were growing uncomfortable with the chaotic debate   We ve got to have a more organized process   Republican Senator Ron Johnson said  noting the skinny repeal would simply delay acting on the core issue   We just don t have the courage and really the intestinal fortitude to suck it up and     do this right   Late on Wednesday  only 10 senators voted for a largely symbolic amendment stating lawmakers  commitment to preserve a part of Obamacare that helped states expand the government s Medicaid insurance program for the poor to cover a wider net of people   Democrats refused to approve any amendment to a bill they dislike and the vote primarily highlighted deep divisions among Republicans  The amendment was introduced by Senator Dean Heller  who faces a tough re election fight in Nevada next year  and supported by Senators Susan Collins  John McCain and other party moderates who have expressed skepticism about the repeal and replace process  Trump attacked one of those senators  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska  by name in an early morning tweet on Wednesday  Murkowski  one of two party members who voted on Tuesday against opening debate on a bill to end Obamacare  told MSNBC she was not worried about the political fallout   Every day shouldn t be about winning elections  How about just doing a little bit of governing around here   she said  Healthcare industry organizations are similarly troubled and have urged a more bipartisan effort  The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  which represents health insurers across the country  said that if the individual mandate is repealed  it must be replaced with incentives for people to buy health insurance and keep it year round  The mandate is considered critical to helping hold down the cost of premiums  because it means that healthy people as well as the sick  who incur high medical costs  buy insurance  The group also said the government needed to fund subsidies for medical expenses and provide funds to cover high cost patients

190877,412393,ANTM,Anthem to pare back Obamacare offerings in Nevada and Georgia,news," Reuters    U S  health insurer Anthem Inc  N ANTM  said on Monday it will no longer offer Obamacare plans in Nevada s state exchange and will stop offering the plans in nearly half of Georgia s counties next year  The moves come after Republican senators last month failed to repeal and replace Obamacare  former President Barack Obama s signature healthcare reform law  creating uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded and managed in 2018  Hundreds of U S  counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months  Nevada had said in June that residents in 14 counties out of 17 in the state would not have access to qualified health plans on the state exchanges  Anthem s decision to leave the state entirely does not increase the number of  bare counties  in the state  Nevada Insurance Commissioner Barbara Richardson said in a statement  The insurer will still offer  catastrophic plans   which can be purchased outside the state s exchange and are only available to consumers under 30 years old or with a low income  Anthem also said it will only offer Obamacare plans in 85 of Georgia s 159 counties  It said the counties it will continue to offer the plans in are mostly rural counties that would otherwise not have health insurance coverage for their residents   It said these changes do not impact Anthem s Medicare Advantage  Medicaid or employer based plans in either state   The company said last week that it will pull out of 16 of 19 pricing regions in California in 2018 where it offered Obamacare options this year   Anthem blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down   U S  President Donald Trump last week threatened to cut off subsidy payments that make the plans affordable for lower income Americans and help insurers to keep premiums down  after efforts to repeal the law signed by his predecessor  President Barack Obama  failed in Congress

190878,412394,ANTM,Why Anthem  ANTM  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Anthem  NYSE ANTM   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This health insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 36  
For the last reported quarter  Anthem came out with earnings of  2 44 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 20 per share  representing a surprise of 10 91   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  3 67 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 81 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 81  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Anthem  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Anthem has an Earnings ESP of  1 29  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-anthem-antm-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200407341,200407341

190889,412405,ANTM,Stocks Jump More Than 1  To Begin The Second Quarter ,opinion,"The market wasn t fooling around today as the major indices built on Friday s performance with a rally of more than 1  each to start the second quarter 
	Positive manufacturing data offered some reassurance to investors who are growing increasingly nervous about slowing economic growth  Specifically  the ISM Manufacturing for March was 55 3  which was above February s dismal 54 2   Of course  we should remember that anything above 50 still denotes expansion  
	Just as importantly though  China also had a good manufacturing report  Perhaps it s a sign that the good vibes coming from the trade talks are not exclusively on this side of the ocean  The talks will resume later this week when China s Vice Premier Liu He makes his way back to Washington 
	Good data and good feelings led to an awesome rally on the first day of April and of the second quarter  On a percentage basis  the NASDAQ had the best performance with a jump of 1 29   or practically 100 points  to 7828 91 
	Meanwhile  the Dow is above 26000 again after soaring 1 27   or just about 330 points  to 26 258 42  The S P continues to move past its own milestone of 2800 by gaining 1 16  to 2867 19 
	All of the major indices finished right around their highs of the day 
	It s worth repeating how impressive the just completed first quarter really was  The NASDAQ surged more than 16   while the S P jumped by about 13  and the Dow increased around 11   We probably shouldn t expect another quarter like that one for a while  However  no one knows how far this mostly optimistic market will run if we finally get a good trade deal and another decent earnings season

190898,412414,ANTM,5 Stocks That Rose More Than 100  In The Trump Era ,opinion,Of all the presidents to grace the White House  Donald Trump possibly stands out for his eagerness to claim credit for the stock market surge during his tenure  Now  as he seeks a second term in office  he is likely to base his campaign on these very successes  per recent reports Whether Trump can truly take the credit for a strong economy and equity markets is a matter of debate  What is for certain is that the economy remains robust despite the slowdown whispers Further  equity markets have recovered from the slowdown they suffered last year and are continuing largely unhindered on their Bull Run  This is why it makes sense to invest in stocks that have gained exponentially during the Trump era Trump Era Witnesses Tremendous Market SurgeThe tremendous surge of market indexes in the Trump era is a recorded fact  When Trump ascended to the presidency on Nov 8  2016  the Dow was hovering around the 18 000 mark Since then it has surged more than 35  as has the S P 500  Gains for the Nasdaq have been even more spectacular  with the tech heavy index notching up a stunning 45  surge during this period A market slump of sorts did take place in late 2018  ending with the most disastrous ever performance on Christmas Eve  This was largely attributable to concerns about global trade and the hawkish approach of the Fed at that time But benchmarks have staged a strong recovery since then with the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq each up more than 18  from their December lows  This is largely attributable to speculation that the Fed will freeze rate hikes for the year  But an impending U S  China trade deal may have been an even greater catalyst for recent gains Trade Deal Crucial for Continuing Equity Market SuccessesIt comes as no surprise then that Trump is aggressively pursuing a trade deal with China in hopes of lifting equity markets ahead of his reelection bid  On Mar 6  CNBC cited sources to reveal that the U S  President is looking to hasten the deal making process in order to boost markets The report follows another by Bloomberg  which claimed that Trump knows that the process of trade negotiations has boosted markets significantly in recent times  This has helped to extend the duration of a rally  which is on the verge of setting a new record On Wednesday  the U S  President said trade negotiations with China were  moving along   Per Bloomberg  the President is likely concerned that the inability to seal a trade deal will take the wind out of the current

190899,412415,ANTM,Fretting About Wall Street Losses  4 Safe Value Bets,opinion,"The recent slump in stock markets that pushed Wall Street indexes to post the biggest weekly losses of 2019 last week  is a result of a wide range of disappointing economic data coupled with investor fears over a global economic slowdown  However  an encouraging fourth quarter GDP  consumer confidence and a likely U S  China trade agreement could turn the financial markets around 
It is in the hope of this rebound that one could consider investing in value stocks at present 
What Dragged Markets Down Recently 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  job additions nearly stalled in February  with the economy adding 20 000 new jobs   well below the consensus expectation of 186 000  Needless to say  the labor market was primarily responsible for lifting market sentiment through steady job additions for months despite a slowing global economy and trade tensions 
Prior to the Labor department data  U S  retail sales  unexpected drop of 1 2  in December had sparked investor concern  After all  a drop in retail sales indicated a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of last year  December s retail sales  slump was also the largest since September 2009  a couple of months after the Great Recession ended 
Moreover  the country s construction spending dropped unexpectedly in December  falling 0 6  against a 0 8  rise in November  This is further proof of the economy cooling toward the end of last year 
In addition  the United States  trade deficit hit a 10 year high of  59 8 billion in December  the Commerce Department cited last week  Slowing demand for American goods can be attributed to declining global growth and a stronger dollar 
The global economic scenario isn t encouraging either  China s year over year exports in February dropped 20 7   marking its largest decline in three years  The European Central Bank  in the meantime  lowered its 2019 forecasts for Eurozone growth as well  stagnating interest rate hikes till the end of this year and bringing in fresh stimulus measures 
However  it s widely believed that these are temporary setbacks  The stock market will surely bounce back on an impending trade deal between the United States and China 
Financial Markets to Gain Soon
According to a CNBC published last week  President Donald Trump is vigorously pursuing a trade deal with the Asian nation in a bid to boost the financial markets ahead of the presidential election next year 
A Bloomberg last week also echoed this  claiming that the President is pushing U S  negotiators to seal a trade deal with China soon because he is aware of the market rallies that have followed every sign of progress in the trade deal these past few weeks 
Therefore  the emergence of a U S  China trade agreement by the end of March is a likely affair  Trump has even expressed his interest in hosting China s president Xi Jinping in Florida for a signing ceremony this month 
In addition  not every aspect of the U S  economy is in bad shape  In fact  the GDP witnessed an annualized growth of 2 6  in the last quarter against a 2 2  rise in the fourth quarter of 2017  to the Bureau of Economic Analysis  The surge in last quarter s GDP was more than analysts  expectation of 1 9  
The uptick in year over year fourth quarter GDP was predominantly due to a rise in consumer spending levels and business investments  This indicates the U S  economy s overall healthy pulse 
To add to the positive factors  consumer confidence increased in February due to an end to the U S  government s longest partial government shutdown 
Why Invest in Value Stocks Now 
With the markets expected to regain momentum after the initial pullback  it s worth investing in value stocks now  And why not  These could be ideal for investment as they are common stocks of companies that are currently trading below their intrinsic value  This means that a company s stock price is trading at a value that doesn t reflect its long term fundamentals 
Therefore  when the temporary downward movement of the financial market subsides  these undervalued stocks could gain and post better price performances

190905,412421,ANTM,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Anthem  ANTM  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Anthem  NYSE ANTM  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this health insurer a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Anthem is 13 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 20 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 20 2  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Anthem is 29 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 25  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Anthem  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 8 7  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Anthem has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

This combination indicates that Anthem is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-anthem-antm-is-a-solid-choice-200388034,200388034
190906,412422,ANTM,What Makes Anthem  ANTM  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Anthem  NYSE ANTM   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Anthem currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ANTM that show why this health insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ANTM  shares are up 0 32  over the past week while the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry is down 0 05  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 16 72  compares favorably with the industry s 1 48  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Anthem have increased 9 59  over the past quarter  and have gained 30 07  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 1 57  and 5 32   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ANTM s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ANTM is averaging 1 632 663 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ANTM 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ANTM s consensus estimate  increasing from  17 59 to  19 13 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ANTM is a  1  Strong Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Anthem on your short list ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-anthem-antm-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200388046,200388046

190912,412428,ANTM,What Makes Anthem  ANTM  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Anthem  NYSE ANTM  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Anthem basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Anthem  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Anthem
For the fiscal year ending December 2019  this health insurer is expected to earn  17 88 per share  which is a change of 12 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Anthem  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

190913,412429,ANTM,Anthem  ANTM  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Anthem  NYSE ANTM   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 21 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  307 23 in the previous session  Anthem has gained 15 6  since the start of the year compared to the 6  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 9 1  return for the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 30  2019  Anthem reported EPS of  2 44 versus consensus estimate of  2 2 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 23  
For the current fiscal year  Anthem is expected to post earnings of  18 97 per share on  99 98 billion in revenues  This represents a 19 38  change in EPS on a 9 46  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  21 83 per share on  108 18 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 15 07  and 8 2   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Anthem may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Anthem has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 16X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 7X versus its peer group s average of 15 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 16  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Anthem currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Anthem meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Anthem shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/anthem-antm-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200384338,200384338

Coming into today  shares of the health insurer had lost 13 57  in the past month  In that same time  the Medical sector lost 11 69   while the S P 500 lost 12 15

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for ANTM  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model

190916,412432,ANTM,Will Anthem  ANTM  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Anthem  NYSE ANTM   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This health insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 62  
For the most recent quarter  Anthem was expected to post earnings of  3 67 per share  but it reported  3 81 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 81   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 19 per share  while it actually produced  4 25 per share  a surprise of 1 43  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Anthem  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Anthem currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 14   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-anthem-antm-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200376755,200376755
190917,412433,ANTM,Anthem  ANTM  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Anthem  NYSE ANTM  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 20 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  70 5  
Revenues are expected to be  23 36 billion  up 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 17  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Anthem 
For Anthem  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Anthem will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Anthem would post earnings of  3 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 81  delivering a surprise of  3 81  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Anthem appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/anthem-antm-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378472,200378472

Anthem said it would send a letter and email to everyone whose information was stored in the hacked database  It also set up an informational website    and will offer to provide a credit monitoring service ",2015-02-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/health-insurer-anthem-hit-by-hackers:-wsj-326629,326629

 NEW YORK  Sept 10  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Thursday
on brighter outlooks from Texas Instruments and Procter  
Gamble that prompted investors to push market gains into a
fifth straight session 
 Procter   Gamble Co was the Dow s biggest lift  gaining 4
percent to  55 93 after it affirmed its earnings forecast for
the current quarter and said sales would improve in the next
quarter 
 The potential for rising sales was encouraging for
investors  who fear anemic consumer spending could stall a
burgeoning recovery 
 Optimism was tempered by a 5 4 percent drop for Monsanto
after the world s biggest seed company forecast fiscal 2010
earnings below Wall Street s estimates  Monsanto dragged the
S P materials index down 0 6 percent 
  Investors are waiting for an assessment on what type of
recovery it is   said Alan Lancz  president of Alan B  Lancz  
Associates Inc in Toledo  Ohio 
  I do think if the market continues its rally into the
fourth quarter  that we re borrowing gains from 2010 from the
standpoint it will be reflecting a v shaped recovery  and any
disappointment there will hurt  
 If the gains hold  it would mean a fifth day of advances
that would push the S P 500 index to its highest level in
nearly a year 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 25 24 points  or
0 26 percent  to 9 572 46  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index

Composite Index rose 7 84 points  or 0 38 percent  to 2 068 23 
 Health insurance stocks rose 1 5 percent after President
Barack Obama played down the importance of a government run
option in a speech on Wednesday  a sign elements of the plan
may be altered to soothe opponents  Critics say reforms will be
expensive and could distort the existing market 
 Cheaper  watered down U S  healthcare reform could help
provide the next leg up for equity markets  said Linda Duessel 
market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh 
  It will be very expensive as it stands right now   said
Duessel   To the extent that it comes down a little bit  the
market should like that  If for whatever reason they wouldn t
be able to come up with any conclusion here and it fails  the
market might really like that  
 Aetna Inc rose 1 2 percent to  29 60 and WellPoint Inc was
up 1 1 percent at  53 43 
 Yahoo Inc jumped 4 7 percent to  15 48 after Banc of

continues to outpace growth in the Internet as a whole 
 Bellwether Texas Instruments raised its third quarter
forecast after the bell Wednesday  expecting to ride a gradual
recovery in the global semiconductor industry  The stock added
0 5 percent to  25 27  while semiconductor shares gained 0 7

190952,412468,ANTM,Triple S Management  GTS  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Triple S Management   NYSE GTS    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 31 3  over the past month  GTS hit a new 52 week high of  37 55 in the previous session  Triple S Management has gained 49 4  since the start of the year compared to the  0 4  move for the Medical sector and the 9  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 8  2018  Triple S Management reported EPS of  0 6 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 24 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4 93  
For the current fiscal year  Triple S Management is expected to post earnings of  1 9 per share on  3 04 billion in revenues  This represents a 0 53  change in EPS on a 4 89  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 2 per share on  3 17 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 15 79  and 4 27   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Triple S Management may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for GTS  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Triple S Management has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 19 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 12 9X versus its peer group s average of 14 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 95  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Triple S Management Corporation Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Triple S Management currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Triple S Management passes the test  Thus  it seems as though GTS shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Triple S Management Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Triple S Management have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including WellCare Health Plans   NYSE WCG    Anthem   NYSE ANTM    and Chemed   NYSE CHE    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GTS  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/triples-management-gts-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200320899,200320899
190978,412494,ANTM,Healthcare Stock Q1 Earnings Due On Apr 25  ANTM  UHS  PRAH,opinion,The first quarter earnings season is unwinding fast with 87 members of the elite S P 500 index already having reported financial numbers  Per the latest   performances of these index participants indicate a 25  increase in total earnings on 10 7  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 82 8  companies surpassing bottom line expectations and 67 8  outperforming on the top line front The Medical sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  is expected to deliver 9 4  earnings growth on 6 8  higher revenues in the first quarter  This is  however  shy of the projected 18 3  and 7 7  revenue and earnings growth  respectively  for the S P 500 index Healthcare is part of the broader medical sector  which includes diversified industries like health maintenance organizations  HMOs  popularly known as health insurers  clinical  laboratories and diagnostics research  medical equipment  hospitals   nursing homes  telehealth services and more  The sector is so diverse that a single factor influencing a sector positively can be a negative for the other sector  For example flu  which causes an increase in medical services utilization  is an earnings driver for the hospital sector while at the same time a negative factor for insurers it causes a spike in claim costs   To put it into perspective  the January to March 2018 period was an unexpectedly brutal flu season  which led to a spike in medical cost for insurers  But because of UnitedHealth s superior medical cost management  the flu season did not have any adverse impact on the company s results  UnitedHealth is considered to be a bellwether for the other companies and its results provide a broad picture of the industry that despite increased flu  the first quarter will be profitable The health insurers are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium and enrollment from the government businesses   Medicare  Medicare Advantage and Medicaid  A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies  Earnings should also see an upside from ancilliary and health service businesses  which the health insurers have been investing in for the past many years to diversify the revenue base  These businesses which focus on data management  management of clinical records  analytics  clinical care  pharmacy care and more have been a nice contributor to the group s earnings in recent years and the trend is expected to continue However  this severe flu season should be a shot in the arm for care providers and other companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain  as it would lead to higher revenues from increasing hospital visits and drug sales  Companies in the hospital sector should see increased patient revenues and admissions as more patients seek medical help  which in turn should drive their top line growth Nevertheless  the hospital companies should continue to feel the heat  from walk in clinics and other outpatient treatment options that have been eating into their admissions volumes for past many quarters Let s find out where the following healthcare stocks insurers stand ahead of their first quarter releases on Apr 25 Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   revenues have been consistently growing over the past several quarters  driven by membership growth  The

The company s Government business has been performing well over a considerable period of time  supported by increasing Medicaid and Medicare enrollment  The consensus mark for total operating revenues of Government business is pegged at  12 8 billion  up 7  year over year However  higher medical costs for individual ACA compliant products and more claims leading to an escalated benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business are expected to drain the bottom line The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 85 for the yet to be reported quarter reflects 3 6  year over year growth  Anthem carries a

Health segments stands at  1 5 billion and  1 3 billion  respectively  up 6 4  and 3 5  each  year over year The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 59 per share for the yet to be reported quarter reflects

191009,412525,ANTM,5 HMO Stocks To Continue Rewarding Investors,opinion,"The Health Maintenance Organization  HMO  industry has consistently outperformed the S P 500 over the last five years with its 285 2  appreciation  easily trumping the S P 500 s 90 2    But the industry started pulling even further ahead in 2015 and again after the election of President Donald Trump  It is currently in the top 9  of Zacks industries 

HMOs have been around for ages  but their prominence in recent years is related to rising medical costs with the consequent pressure on insurers  profitability and the belief that timely checkups and preventive services can reduce expenditure  Moreover  HMOs generally consist of a network of physicians  general physicians  specialists  geriatricians  etc  and insurers  where covered individuals can get cheaper services by making copayments  Services from other medical professionals are generally not covered by the HMO   
President Obama s Affordable Care Act  Obamacare  included mandates for individuals to buy insurance  provided for the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and offered subsidies to individuals so they could do the needful  The Graham Cassidy Heller Johnson   GCHJ   bill or the Graham Cassidy bill seeks to strike down these aspects of the law  instead providing block grants to states  offering them the flexibility to frame their own healthcare laws while putting a ceiling on the amount of aid per person from the center and increasing it at a rate that is slower than health care inflation  Needless to say  the decision will be very hard to implement and the outcome  uncertain   
The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  put out a hurried preliminary report analyzing the change  Its main finding was that while the change would reduce the on budget deficit between 2017 and 2026 by at least  133 billion  there would be a significant decline in insured individuals arising from the decline in Medicaid enrollment  decline in non group coverage because of elimination of subsidies and decline in all kinds of health insurance because of the removal of penalties  These would be partially mitigated by state programs that would however be hard to frame and implement in the limited time     
The uninsured rate  people without insurance for the whole year  was 8 8  or 28 1 million in 2016  as measured by the CPS ASEC  US Census Bureau   but if Obamacare is withdrawn  it s expected that uninsured individuals would increase by 18 million through 2019 and 21 million through 2026   Business Insider quoting Brookings Institution and Commonwealth Fund   Lower insured levels increase demand for affordable healthcare  which is positive for HMOs  Of course  many HMOs also cater to Medicaid and schemes mandated by the government  so they stand to benefit no matter which way the law goes 
Demographics also remain favorable for the industry with an aging population  baby boomers   more in need of affordable  long term healthcare  Since both this segment and the impacted by injury incapacitation are incapable of or have limited capability of earning money and therefore  paying insurance premiums  they primarily require managed healthcare  such as provided by an HMO  Tech Navio estimates that chronic diseases such as heart disease  cancer  type 2 diabetes and arthritis that have become common across the globe will contribute to an 11  compounded annual growth rate in health insurance enrolments through 2020  This  along with low penetration rates across the world  especially in emerging markets create a good backdrop for HMO expansion 
Technology is playing a bigger role in digitizing patient information and tools like smartphones and wearables are increasing involvement of millennial customers in their own healthcare  Moreover  millennials are thriftier than boomers  so lower cost health management solutions are likely to be more attractive 
The strong growth drivers have led to a 41 0  increase in HMO revenue over the past five years with a 35 6  increase in EBITDA and 34 1  increase in earnings before non recurring items 
Given the nature of the industry  regulatory pressures are likely to persist along with related compliance costs  The need for technology integration to cater to changing customer needs is likely adding to the cost pressure  But top line growth should continue  evening things out over time

191029,412545,ANTM,Why Earnings Season Could Be Great For Anthem  ANTM ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Anthem is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ANTM in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  2 45 per share for ANTM  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 41 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ANTM  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  1 55  heading into earnings season Anthem  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that ANTM has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Anthem  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-earnings-season-could-be-great-for-anthem-antm-200220630,200220630
191046,412562,ANTM,Should Value Investors Consider Anthem  ANTM  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Anthem has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Anthem s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 13 3  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Anthem has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 4  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Anthem has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Anthem currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ANTM a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 5  which is slightly better than the industry average of 13 7  Clearly  ANTM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Anthem might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives ANTM a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the consensus estimate for the current quarter has dipped 0 4  in the past two months  the full year estimate has inched up 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Anthem  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAnthem is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a formidable industry rank  top 5  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades

191069,412585,ANTM,Is Anthem  ANTM  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Anthem has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 77  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 30  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Anthem s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen slightly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Medical Health Maintenance Organization industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 46  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Anthem has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 96  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Anthem has a P S ratio of about 0 60  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  However  as we can see in the chart below  this is above its midpoint in particular over the past few years ANTM is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Anthem currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Anthem a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Anthem might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives ANTM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen seven upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 3 3  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has increased 1 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Anthem  Inc  Price and Consensus    This positive trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAnthem is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 22   and strong Zacks Rank  Anthem looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical Health Maintenance Organization industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you

191080,412596,ANTM,3 Reasons Why Anthem  ANTM  Is A Great Momentum Stock,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for ANTM s status as a solid momentum stock below Longer Term Price Change for Anthem  Inc While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of ANTM  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 10 8  to 2 7  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 33 3   Clearly  ANTM is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors   Anthem  Inc  Price   Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Change for ANTMIn addition to price performance  it is also important to take a look at earnings estimate changes for the full year  This can show if ANTM is poised to make a run based on fundamentals  or if the company is simply moving on speculation Over the past month  the full year earnings estimate for ANTM has risen by 2 03   On its own this is impressive  but consider that it also beats the industry average of 1 14  too  The trend is undeniably in Anthem s favor right now  and it suggests that the momentum might be long lasting for this stock   ANTM Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with ANTM as of late too Over the past two months  seven earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that seven estimate have moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago ANTM was expected to post earnings of  11 51 per share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  11 76 for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have ANTM as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep ANTM on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-anthem-(antm)-is-a-great-momentum-stock-200189171,200189171

undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Anthem currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Anthem a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Anthem might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives ANTM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been enough encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower  This has had a significant impact on the current quarter consensus estimate that has risen by 3 6  in the past two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Anthem  Inc  Price and Consensus   Even Anthem has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAnthem is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank   Bottom 13  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many

191137,412653,ANTM,3 Health Care Stocks To Buy This Earnings Season,opinion,"This year  profits have been really hard to pocket  Indeed  progress in 2015 is much like an EKG chart  You have your ups and downs  but ultimately you end up where you started  On January 2  the index was at 2058  Today the index is at 2057 5  Year to date  the S P 500 has basically gone nowhere  Hopefully this isn t the case for your portfolio 
If  however  your investments are caught up in the negativity that Greece  China  and growth concerns have brought into the market  you need to focus on sectors which have a positive outlook  One such sector is US healthcare  Year to date  the iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH  has picked up a return of 9 5   As mentioned earlier  the S P has gone nowhere  Don t stay stagnant  jump on the ship with a rising tide 
Did I mention that earnings season is here  At Zacks  we have a system that tells us who will beat earnings estimates with more than 70  accuracy  A part of this system is called Earnings Expected Surprise Prediction  or ESP for short  The other part of this system includes stocks from a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   When a stock has a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  it is much more likely to beat the earnings consensus 
Below  we have listed three health care stocks set for a great earnings season and perhaps a great year  They are from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industry  the latter of which will benefit greatly from the Supreme Court s decision to grant eligibility to people who have enrolled into an Obamacare subsidy without enrolling into their state run insurance  We have selected these stocks based on their promising growth potential  fair valuation  and favorable earnings prospects 
Anthem Inc  NYSE ANTM 
Anthem is a health insurance company offering an array of care plans for large and small employers  individuals  and those on Medicaid and Medicare  Anthem is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   It doles out a 1 57  dividend to shareholders  ANTM has a positive ESP of 0 74   making it a likely candidate to surpass our earnings estimate for the quarter 
Anthem has a score of  A  for Growth in the Style Scores  Its EPS is projected to increase by 14 03  this year  Its net profit margin is 3 64   which may not seem significant at first glance  However  that margin more than doubles the industry s average profit margin of 1 62  
The valuations are pretty favorable for the company  It trades at a forward PE of 15 89  while the industry as a whole currently has a forward PE of 21 94  Another encouraging fact to go along with Anthem s PE is its PEG  which is currently 1 58  ANTM has a price to book of 1 75 
In the last 60 days  there have been no negative estimate revisions by analysts  In that time span  there have actually been 5 analysts raising their earnings projections upwards for the quarter  In the last 90 days  our EPS consensus for the quarter has gone from  2 64 to  2 71  a notable increase  Anthem has beaten our earnings consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters  and it reports its earnings on 7 29 15 
Centene Corporation  NYSE CNC 
Centene is a health insurer specially catering to the needs of those under Medicaid  They also offer health solutions through their specialty services companies  CNC is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Centene gets a  B  for Growth  It has an impressive sales to assets ratio of 3 22  CNC s EPS is projected to increase by 18 58   outperforming the industry s meager 10 77   Sales are projected to increase year over year by 33 9  in 2015  Its trailing twelve month ROE is 17 94   Although the stock s forward PE isn t the greatest  the price to sales of 0 46 affirms some value in the stock  So does the PEG of 1 46 
In the last 60 days  21 analysts have changed their earnings estimates for the company  In fact  they all raised their estimates for this quarter  30 days ago  our consensus had us estimating earning of  0 62 per share  Now  however  our consensus estimates that we ll see the EPS at  0 69  CNC will likely beat our consensus  though  since it has a positive ESP of 1 45  complementing its Strong Buy rank  Centene reports its earnings on 7 28 15 
AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ AMAG 
AMAG Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical corporation that develops and markets therapeutic iron compounds to treat illnesses like anemia  These compounds also aid in the diagnosing of other diseases  AMAG is a Zacks Rank  1 
The stock has a massive EPS growth estimate  projecting a 2 229 41  increase since last year  The trailing twelve month profit margin is also massive at 80 71   Sales are expected to be 217 7  higher than last year  People who have invested in the stock since 2014 saw share prices climb over 190  up until now  With the massive growth expected  it will not be surprising to see the stock have an impressive 2015 
AMAG trades at a forward PE of 19 42  which isn t impressive at first glance  Keep in mind  though  that there are high expectations for pharmaceutical stocks as a whole  Evidence of this is the fact that the industry is currently trading at a forward price to earnings multiple of 29 73  This may even make AMAG look cheap in relation to other pharmaceutical stocks  Another stat to back up this suggestion is its price to book of 3 2  The industry as a whole trades at a P B of 5 5  so AMAG wins it out here as far as valuations go 
30 days ago  our EPS consensus estimated earnings of  0 67 per share for this quarter  Now  our consensus is higher  standing at earnings of  0 75 per share  AMAG has beaten our earnings estimates in two of the last three quarters  It s worth mentioning that AMAG has beaten our earnings estimates by an average of 31 69  per quartet in that time frame  AMAG has an ESP of 25 33   so you can be assured that this stock has a great chance of beating our current EPS consensus of  0 75  The biopharmaceutical company reports its earnings on 8 4 15 
Bottom line
Healthcare has been a great place to invest in for the last five years  With an aging economy and an increasing demand for healthcare  the horizon looks great for the sector as a whole  Therefore  you should keep an eye out for great healthcare stocks with rising estimates  high growth projections  and fair valuations 
I hope your portfolio isn t lifeless this year  If  however  your portfolio is in need of resuscitation  we re here to bring it back to life  At Zacks  our stock rating system has been outperforming the S P 500 for decades  with average annual returns yielding 26   Don t miss out ",2015-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-top-ranked-health-care-stocks-to-buy-this-earnings-season-257883,257883
