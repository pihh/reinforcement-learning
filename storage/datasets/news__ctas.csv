27621,249136,CTAS,Cintas  CTAS  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Cintas  CTAS  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cintas basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Cintas  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cintas
For the fiscal year ending May       2020  this uniform rental company is expected to earn  8 72 per share  which is a change of 14 7  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cintas  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Cintas to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cintas-ctas-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200493858,200493858
27622,249137,CTAS,Caterpillar To Benefit From Cost Cuts And Strategic Moves,opinion,On Dec 27  we issued an updated research report on Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    The company s global machine sales growth has been declining for the past few months  hitting the lowest point in November  which remains a concern  Caterpillar anticipates modestly lower sales compared with previous year as dealers continue to lower inventory  It is thus taking steps to reduce production to match dealer demand and will proactively increase production once order levels improve  Focus on strategic investments  cost cutting measures and growing offerings and services  and digital initiatives like e commerce  will aid growth Retail Sales DecliningCaterpillar s global retail sales for the three month period

order backlog came in at  14 6 billion  reflecting a sequential drop of  400 million  This does not bode well for fourth quarter 2019 revenues  For the ongoing quarter  the company expects end user demand to remain flat and dealers to make further inventory reductions thanks to the global economic uncertainty For 2019  Caterpillar s adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 is pegged at  10 59  11 09  The mid point of the guided range reflects a decline of 3  from 2018  This guidance reflects lower end user demand and dealers reducing their inventory Weak Manufacturing Sector a DeterrentThe U S  China

1  in November 2019   the fourth straight month of contraction in the sector   This contraction in the manufacturing sector is likely to impact Caterpillar s performance Caterpillar Taking Proactive Steps to Counter Weak DemandCaterpillar will continue to monitor end user demand  commercial shipments  dealer inventory  orders and backlog and plans to adjust production levels accordingly  The company has been successful in reducing the lead times  which allows dealers to maintain lower levels of inventory  Further  shorter lead times allow both the company and its dealers to adapt quickly to changing market conditions  The company is also taking steps to reduce production to match dealer demand and will proactively increase production once order levels improve Restructuring  Expanded Offerings to Aid PerformanceIn September 2015  Caterpillar initiated significant restructuring and cost reduction initiative  which is expected to lower annual operating costs by about  1 5 billion  The company is focused on developing a more competitive and flexible cost structure and controlling discretionary spending Meanwhile  Caterpillar continues to focus on customers and future by continuing to invest in digital capabilities  connecting assets and jobsites along with developing the next generation of more productive and efficient products  The company plans to fund initiatives that drive long term profitable growth focused on areas of expanded offerings and services and digital initiatives like e commerce  It will also focus on connected assets  autonomous machines  and new engine technologies and machine programs  It will use Operating   Execution Model to divert resources to areas that represent the greatest opportunity for return on investments  Caterpillar expects to

27649,249164,CTAS,Stocks   U S  Futures Continue Decline as Government Shutdown Looms,news,"Investing com   U S  futures pointed to a lower open on Friday as investors  sour mood continued ahead of a looming government shutdown  Trade was expected to be thin as many investors packed up for the Christmas holiday  but key economic data was apt to keep some traders at their desk before heading off for the long weekend 
The blue chip Dow futures fell 56 points  or 0 24   to 22 940 50 points by 6 52 AM ET  11 52 GMT   while S P 500 futures lost 8 points  or 0 33   to 2 478 00 points  Meanwhile the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 25 points  or 0 40   to 6 300 25 
 China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down  and some of the economic indicators from the U S  have been a bit soft recently  but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019   said Michael Hewson  chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London 
He said speculation the U S  economy could be headed for a recession has picked up  dampening global sentiment   Fear about a U S  government shutdown is playing into the mix too  
Although the U S  House of Representatives passed a temporary funding measure on Thursday that included funding for the proposed southern border wall  odds were low that the Senate would give its approval  causing fears that an agreement would not be reached to avoid a government shutdown ahead of Friday s midnight deadline 
The House passed a bill to keep the government running until Feb  8  but the Senate  which convenes at 12 00 PM ET  17 00 GMT   would likely shoot down the proposal precisely because of the more than  5 billion in funding for the wall 
U S  President Donald Trump refused to sign off on any temporary funding that lacks payment for border security 
Despite the upcoming holiday season  Friday s session will be replete with a deluge of economic data 
First up  the Commerce Department will report on durable goods orders for November at 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT  
On average  economists expect that orders for long lasting goods rose 1 6  last month and that core durable goods orders  which exclude autos  rose 0 3  
The final measure of third quarter GDP will also be released at that time  with forecasts for it to stay at its previous estimate of growth at an annual rate of 3 5  
At 10 00 AM ET  15 00 GMT   the November figures on personal spending and income will be published  with both expected to have risen 0 3   The core PCE price index  the Fed s favorite inflation gauge  is forecast to tick up to an annual rate of 1 9   just below the Fed s target 
Also coming in at that time will be the final measure of the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index for December  Economists expect it rose slightly from its preliminary measure to 97 6 
Ahead of the data  the U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback against six rival currencies  was up 0 33  to 96 05 by 6 54 AM ET  11 54 GMT

highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  No Phase One Deal This Year  Buy 5 Dividend Aristocrats NowIt seems completion of a  phase one  U S  China trade deal may be deferred till next year as Beijing asks for more widespread tariff rollbacks and the Trump administration counters with more demands of its own  President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did say some time back that the initial trade deal may just take five weeks  But  that seems vague now as trade negotiations get more complicated The Trump administration realized that rolling back of tariffs for a deal that fails to address core issues  including intellectual property and technology transfer  may not be a good thing  Things have  by the way  become even more complicated with the U S  International Trade Commission recently saying that the U S  industry has been affected by imports of aluminum wire and cables from China What s more  China has now condemned a U S  Senate resolution for supporting human rights issues in Hong Kong  The U S  Senate passed a bill recently that heavily criticized the crackdown on Hong Kong protesters  This will certainly complicate the completion of the initial trade deal  After all  China has threatened to take  strong countermeasures  if Congress passes the bill Trump  in the meanwhile  added that  China is going to have to make a deal that I like and that if we don t make a deal with China  I ll just raise the tariffs even higher   Lest we forget  a new set of tariffs on nearly  156 billion worth of Chinese products  including holiday gift items  are set to take effect on Dec 15 The flare up in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing isn t good news for the stock market  Trade tensions between two of the world s largest economies have slowed down global economic growth and squeezed corporate profit margins And how can we forget that a possible delay in the U S  China trade deal is bringing back shades of a stock market downturn in May for

27801,249316,CTAS,SEC director with big stock holdings stirs debate,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    Keith Higgins  who runs the office that reviews public companies  books at the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  reported stock holdings worth between about  2 million and  6 million last year and the sale of stocks throughout 2014  according to SEC disclosures viewed by Reuters 
Higgins disclosed holdings in about 90 public companies during his SEC tenure in 2013  making him the biggest investor in individual stocks among the agency s top officials last year 
Since the beginning of the year  he has reported about 60 transactions involving sales of stocks such as Dollar Tree  O DLTR   Apple  O AAPL   Abbott Laboratories  N ABT  and Raytheon  N RTN   with about two thirds of those occurring in late September in a flurry of sales  Higgins may no longer be the biggest stock holder among the top SEC officials Reuters reviewed because of these sales 
Such stock holdings are permitted by federal and SEC ethics laws and regulations  The law already protects against conflicts by prohibiting government officials from working on matters that could benefit them financially 
But Higgins  large holdings  and the volume of trading he reported during 2013 and 2014  may stoke debate about whether it s proper for the Director of Corporation Finance or other top SEC officials to be active stock market participants and whether the SEC needs to tighten its ethics policies to further reduce the appearance of potential conflicts 
 The SEC should explain how and why its procedures allowing top officials to hold individual stock are adequate to prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest   said Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley  responding to questions posed by Reuters  Grassley is a frequent SEC watchdog and is due to become the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
A Reuters review of financial disclosures provided by the agency show that while working for the SEC in 2013  Higgins reported holding stocks  American depository shares and one specialized product that gives shareholders certain rights after a merger  Collectively  these investments ranged in value from a little less than  2 million to just under  6 million 
From those holdings  Higgins reported between about  53 000 to about  185 000 in dividends and or capital gains for calendar year 2013  
An SEC spokesperson said that the agency has a strong conflict of interest policy and that Higgins  holdings have not resulted in many recusals  He s complying with the conflicts rules  the spokesperson said 
 The SEC s stock ownership rules are one of the most  if not the most  stringent of any federal government agency and go well beyond the standard prohibitions   the spokesperson said   A number of safeguards are in place in order to avoid even the appearance of a potential conflict of interest  including the requirement that all transactions be approved in advance and reported to the agency s ethics office 
 Mr  Higgins  limited number of recusals has had no impact on his ability to perform his responsibilities as the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance  He has and will continue to provide his sound judgment and expertise in making decisions on the significant matters in the division  
Higgins declined to comment for this story    
ROPES   GRAY
Higgins  63  joined the SEC in June 2013  after spending about 30 years at the Boston based law firm of Ropes   Gray LLP where he handled numerous initial public offerings 
Higgins reported a partnership income of about  1 1 million for his work in 2013  according to his disclosures 
At the SEC  Higgins oversees the division that reviews thousands of potentially market moving company disclosures each year and gives companies feedback on their compliance with SEC disclosure rules 
The division also decides when companies can exclude shareholder proposals from corporate ballots  and can determine when companies that break the law can be granted certain regulatory waivers  such as one that lets larger  well known companies conduct capital raising deals without prior SEC approval 
Former SEC officials say Higgins  job typically involves higher level policy decisions  and directors rarely get involved in company specific disclosures and decisions  They also said the agency is careful about managing conflicts through recusals 
David Martin  a former SEC corporation finance director who now works for the law firm Covington   Burling LLP  said   I would imagine that Keith could serve his entire time there and never be the deciding voice on a major issue for one of the companies in which he holds stock  
 
REDUCING CONFLICTS
An SEC spokesperson said that some of the stocks reported by Higgins last year are in a trust that belongs to his mother in law  She relies on the trust for financial support  and Higgins  wife is the contingent beneficiary 
Under federal ethics laws  the financial interest of these holdings would be imputed to him as well 
Richard Painter  a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and former White House ethics lawyer  said family trusts are a common problem when trying to navigate conflicts  and sometimes the only way to resolve it is through recusals 
 It is very difficult to ask family members and family trusts to sell stocks when they will surely get hit with a capital gains tax for doing so   he said 
 The best answer is sometimes to live with the conflict  
The SEC declined to say how many times Higgins has needed to recuse himself due to his financial holdings 
 To reduce the time needed to monitor his holdings  Mr  Higgins reduced his individual stock holdings through a series of sales in the fall of this year   an SEC spokesperson said   Because any stock held in his mother in law s trust continues to require monitoring  the sales involved stocks not also owned by the trust  
 
TIGHTENING THE RULES
Federal ethics rules give employees across the government a variety of options for managing conflicts  Employees  for instance  are not required to recuse on matters if they own below  15 000 in a stock  Staffers can also manage conflicts through other means  including recusals and seeking ethics waivers 
All U S  government employees are required to recuse themselves from any particular matter that could financially benefit themselves  their spouse or a dependent child 
Many government agencies have supplemental rules tailored for them  The Federal Reserve  for instance  bans employees from investing in banks or certain government securities dealers 
The SEC adopted tighter ethics restrictions in 2010 that ban staff from holding the stock of any company directly regulated by the SEC  including many banks  which operate SEC regulated brokerages  asset managers or stock exchanges 
The agency staff is also prohibited from buying and selling any stock of a company under investigation  and they are generally subject to a six month holding period after purchasing a security 
In addition  staff must get all of their trades pre cleared through an automated ethics program that checks for possible conflicts and  in some cases  by an SEC ethics attorney 
Some experts said the ethics rules on the books are already strict enough  and making them tougher could adversely affect the SEC 
Donald Langevoort  a professor at Georgetown University Law Center  said tightening ethics rules further could chill recruitment of top talent  There are benefits to having active investors in SEC leadership ranks  including the idea that it gives them  a little skin in the game   he said 
Michael Guttentag  a professor of securities law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles  said it s  ill advised  for public figures in a position of power in the markets to own individual securities   At the very least  it creates the potential impression of impropriety   he said 
HIGGINS  PORTFOLIO
Some of the stocks in Higgins  disclosures  such as Google and Apple  were listed for multiple accounts  including an IRA retirement account   
In addition to stocks  Higgins  53 page 2013 year end disclosure lists corporate bonds  mutual funds and exchange traded funds  municipal bonds  bank accounts and real estate investments 
Since the beginning of 2014  Higgins collectively reported about 60 stock transactions that in total ranged in value from a little over  600 000 to as high as over  2 million  according to more recent disclosures Higgins filed throughout this year 
For many of Higgins  individual stock holdings  the disclosures don t specify when the stocks were originally bought or at what price 
Some of the transactions reported suggest the stocks were not sold at especially opportune times 
For example  he reported selling Nike on May 28  2014  when the company s shares closed at  76 27  Since then  the stock has climbed 24 percent  On the other hand  Higgins reported selling Exxon Mobil shares on July 14 when its stock closed at  102 68  Since then  the stock has dropped 6 percent 
It couldn t be determined how many stocks Higgins  family may still own  in part because federal ethics rules don t require him to disclose purchases or sales that fall below a  1 000 threshold 
PORTFOLIOS OF TOP SEC OFFICIALS
Of all the top SEC directors or commissioners  Higgins reported holding the most individual stocks in 2013  Coming in second last year was Norman Champ  the director of the Investment Management Division  the unit tasked with regulating asset managers  Champ reported holdings in about 50 individual company stocks  as well as a variety of corporate and municipal bonds and mutual funds 
Champ declined to comment 
The only other top SEC officials to report owning individual stocks were Steve Luparello  the head of Trading and Markets  Mark Flannery  the chief economist  and Democratic SEC Commissioners Luis Aguilar and Kara Stein 
Luparello reported holdings in a little more than a dozen different stocks 
Aguilar reported holdings in a little over half a dozen  though two were inherited by his wife and divested in April 2013 to comply with ethics requirements  records show 
Stein and Flannery each reported holding one stock 
 In advance of becoming an SEC commissioner  I was advised by the SEC s ethics office as to what investments I needed to sell and what investments I could legally retain and I followed their advice   Aguilar said in an interview with Reuters 
 Since then  I have neither bought nor sold any new public companies  Both I  my staff and the SEC ethics office monitors these holdings and I recuse from these matters whenever I am advised to do so  
Luparello  Stein and Flannery declined to comment 
The remaining top officials  including SEC Chair Mary Jo White  only listed equity and debt holdings in mutual funds  exchange traded funds or other indices  as opposed to individual stocks 

Mutual funds  exchanged traded funds and other indices made up the majority of the kinds of holdings reported by most top SEC officials

27913,249428,CTAS,Cintas  CTAS  Is Up 1 81  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cintas  CTAS   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CTAS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uniform rental company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CTAS  shares are up 1 81  over the past week while the Zacks Uniform and Related industry is up 1 37  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 93  compares favorably with the industry s 1 7  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Cintas have increased 1 93  over the past quarter  and have gained 43 38  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 0 04  and 8 47   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CTAS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CTAS is currently averaging 625 742 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CTAS 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CTAS s consensus estimate  increasing from  8 42 to  8 57 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line

28073,249588,CTAS,Cintas  CTAS  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of Cintas  CTAS  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 8 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  271 78 in the previous session  Cintas has gained 59 3  since the start of the year compared to the 12 2  move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 54 8  return for the Zacks Uniform and Related industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on September 24  2019  Cintas reported EPS of  2 32 versus consensus estimate of  2 14 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 49  
For the current fiscal year  Cintas is expected to post earnings of  8 57 per share on  7 32 billion in revenues  This represents a 12 76  change in EPS on a 6 14  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  9 44 per share on  7 74 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 17  and 5 85   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Cintas may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Cintas has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 31 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 23 3X versus its peer group s average of 17 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 3 01  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Cintas meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Cintas shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Cintas Stack Up to the Competition

28153,249668,CTAS,Top Analyst Reports For Netflix  Charter Communications   Dominion Energy,opinion,"Thursday  September 26  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   NFLX   Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   CHTR  and Dominion Energy  D   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Netflix s shares have underperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry in the past six months   25 1  vs   11 9    The Zacks analyst expects Netflix to benefit from an expanding content portfolio despite increasing competition from the likes of YouTube  HBO  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime video  Disney  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Peacock 
The company provided an optimistic third quarter outlook and believes that the lost shows  Friends and The Office  will free up budget that can be spent on original content  The acquisition of Seinfeld s streaming rights is a positive in this regard  Meanwhile  estimates have been stable ahead of the company s third quarter earnings release  Netflix has a record of positive earnings surprises in recent quarters 
Nevertheless  high streaming content obligation and increased spending are expected to hurt cash flow generation  In fact  a higher cash burn rate in 2019 is a major headwind  Netflix s shares have underperformed the industry on a year to date basis 
 You can  
Shares of Charter Communications have gained 6 4  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Cable TV industry s rise of 4 9   The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from growth in Internet  mobile  commercial and video revenues  Increase in Internet speed at no extra cost is also aiding subscriber growth 
Additionally  Charter is looking to attract video customers by providing a new OTT video service  Moreover  lower capital expenditure  owing to a decline in consumer premises equipment and scalable infrastructure spending  is expected to boost profitability 
However  commercial revenues are expected to suffer due to migration of customers to Spectrum pricing and packaging from Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House  Moreover  Charter persistently loses video subscribers  primarily due to cord cutting and intense competition from streaming service providers like Netflix and Amazon 
 You can   
Dominion Energy s shares have gained 12 5  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Electric Power industry s rise of 20 5  over the same period  The Zacks analyst believes that Dominion Energy is benefiting from regulated organic growth projects and acquisition synergies 
Strong long term capital expenditure plan of  26 billion for expansion of electric transmission and distribution  along with addition of renewable assets  natural gas facilities and midstream assets are the major positives  The company s merger with SCANA  which proved to be accretive to Dominion s earnings  will continue to boost long term performance  Contribution from Southeast Energy and Power Delivery businesses is also leading to strong performance of the company 
However  Dominion Energy s future earnings may be largely affected by share dilution  Ongoing delay in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project may impact Dominion Energy s profitability

28154,249669,CTAS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Netflix  Charter  Dominion  Marathon And Cintas,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  September 27  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    Charter Communications   NASDAQ CHTR    Dominion Energy   NYSE D    Marathon Petroleum   NYSE MPC   and Cintas   NASDAQ CTAS   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Top Analyst Reports for Netflix  Charter Communications and Dominion EnergyThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Netflix  Charter Communications and Dominion Energy  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Netflix s shares have underperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry in the past six months   25 1  vs   11 9    The Zacks analyst expects Netflix to benefit from an expanding content portfolio despite increasing competition from the likes of YouTube  HBO  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime video  Disney  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Peacock The company provided an optimistic third quarter outlook and believes that the lost shows  Friends and The Office  will free up budget that can be spent on original content  The acquisition of Seinfeld s streaming rights is a positive in this regard  Meanwhile  estimates have been stable ahead of the company s third quarter earnings release  Netflix has a record of positive earnings surprises in recent quarters Nevertheless  high streaming content obligation and increased spending are expected to hurt cash flow generation  In fact  a higher cash burn rate in 2019 is a major headwind  Netflix s shares have underperformed the industry on a year to date basis  You can  Shares of Charter Communications have gained 6 4  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Cable TV industry s rise of 4 9   The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from growth in Internet  mobile  commercial and video revenues  Increase in Internet speed at no extra cost is also aiding subscriber growth Additionally  Charter is looking to attract video customers by providing a new OTT video service  Moreover  lower capital expenditure  owing to a decline in consumer premises equipment and scalable infrastructure spending  is expected to boost profitability However  commercial revenues are expected to suffer due to migration of customers to Spectrum pricing and packaging from Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House  Moreover  Charter persistently loses video subscribers  primarily due to cord cutting and intense competition from streaming service providers like Netflix and Amazon  You can   Dominion Energy s shares have gained 12 5  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Electric Power industry s rise of 20 5  over the same period  The Zacks analyst believes that Dominion Energy is benefiting from regulated organic growth projects and acquisition synergies Strong long term capital expenditure plan of  26 billion for expansion of electric transmission and distribution  along with addition of renewable assets  natural gas facilities and midstream assets are the major positives  The company s merger with SCANA  which proved to be accretive to Dominion s earnings  will continue to boost long term performance  Contribution from Southeast Energy and Power Delivery businesses is also leading to strong performance of the company However  Dominion Energy s future earnings may be largely affected by share dilution  Ongoing delay in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project may impact Dominion Energy s profitability   You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include

28190,249705,CTAS,5 Dividend Aristocrats To Buy As October Sees A Shaky Start,opinion,Despite the U S  China trade concerns  impeachment jitters  uncertainty about Fed s future course of action and slowdown in corporate earnings  the stock market has fared well so far this year However  things have been taking a turn for the worse of late  making it difficult for equities to stay afloat  While a private sector report has shown that the pace of job creation has slowed down  U S  factory activity fell for the second straight month In such a scenario  investing in dividend aristocrats will help safeguard your portfolio prudent  After all  these stocks provide higher total returns with lower volatility Wall Street Takes a Hit  Fear Index PopsThe Dow dropped 1 9  on Oct 2  following a decline of 1 3  in the previous trading session  The blue chip index saw the worst start to a quarter since the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008  The broader S P 500  by the way  dropped more than 1  in successive sessions for the first time this year  And for the S P 500  it s the nastiest quarterly beginning since the fourth quarter of 2009  In fact  all the S P 500 sectors declined in

sessions of this month  eclipsing the 24 6  gain in the fourth quarter of 1992 Investors have thus flocked to safe assets such as bonds and gold  But why in the first place are they deserting stocks  This is because a slowdown in private sector hiring and contraction witnessed by American manufacturers raise concerns about the current state of the economy What s Driving This Market Mayhem Per the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report  the nation s private sector companies added a modest 135 000 jobs in September  a tell tale sign that hiring is decelerating along with the broader economy  We should know that analysts had expected job addition of 152 000 ADP trimmed the number of new jobs created in August from an earlier 195 000 to 157 000  Needless to say  ADP is the largest processor of paychecks for a number of companies and thus millions of employees Such a decline in private sector hiring amplified concerns that the trade war with China is certainly taking a toll on the domestic economy  let alone global conditions  Tom Plumb  chief investment officer at Plumb Funds  cautioned that  people have been anticipating a bear market for years and they are very anxious and so any number like the ADP number is amplified in the volatility on the downside  To add to the bearishness  American manufacturers saw their largest contraction last month since the 2007 2009 great recession  The ISM s manufacturing index was 47 8  for September  dropping from 49 1  in August and marking the lowest level since June 2009 It s worth pointing out that any reading above 50  indicates that the economy is in good shape  but anything below 50  shows that things are getting pretty messy  Again  the biggest culprit in this case is the ongoing trade issue Time to Buy Dividend Aristocrats  5 Solid

28223,249738,CTAS,Can Deere Overcome Tariff Impact   Weak Agricultural Sector ,opinion,Deere   Company   NYSE DE   is expected to be hit hard as China s latest round of tariffs is aggravating the woes of an already struggling U S agricultural sector  The U S Agriculture industry has been grappling with low commodity prices and sluggish farm incomes over the past few years  Moreover  tariffs imposed by China on U S  agricultural exports last year dealt a severe blow to the industry as China is the largest export market for U S  agriculture producers  Per American Farm Bureau  farm bankruptcy filings have gone up 13  in the 12 month period ended June 2019  Further  delinquency rates for commercial agricultural loans are at a six year high Farmers have thus been more cautious about spending on farm equipment  which in turn put pressure on Deere s top line  China s recent announcement to hike tariffs between 5  and 10  on U S  goods worth  75 billion including agricultural products  in two stages on Sep 1 and Dec 15  2019  thus raises a red flag for Deere s customers Apart from the impact of weak farm equipment spending on Deere s top line  its margins continue to bear the brunt of higher raw material costs on account of the implementation of tariffs During third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call  Deere  one of the major names in the  industry  lowered its expectation for net income for fiscal 2019 to about  3 2 billion from the prior  3 3 billion citing the ongoing trade war and a weak agricultural sector  For the Agriculture   Turf segment  Deere anticipates industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada to be flat in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior fiscal year  The segment s overall fiscal 2019 sales are expected to be up 2  year over year  So far this year  shares of Deere have gained 3 9   underperforming its  s growth of 4 5  Silver LiningHowever  it s too early to write off Deere as we believe strong results from the Construction   Forestry segment will help negate the impact of a weak agricultural sector and tariffs  Notably  in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019  the segment s sales improved 11  and operating profit improved 66  from the prior year comparable period  This was aided by the Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volume and price realization  somewhat offset by unfavorable foreign exchange As a reminder  Deere acquired the world s leading road construction equipment maker  Wirtgen  for  5 2 billion in cash and debt in December 2017  The buyout significantly enhanced Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  The company updated its synergy target to 125 million euro by 2022 With order books extending into the fourth quarter  the segment is poised for improved results for fiscal 2019  Deere projects global sales for Construction   Forestry equipment to rise 10  in fiscal 2019  For the fiscal  U S  GDP  total construction investments  housing starts and oil activity remains at supportive levels for equipment demand  Equipment rental utilization remains high and rental rates are likely to trend higher in 2019  Global transportation investment this year is expected to be up about 5   spurring demand for road construction equipment  which bodes well for Wirtgen Deere is also assessing cost structure by reviewing organization efficiency and footprint assessment  which in turn will help improve margins  Deere will benefit from concerted focus on launching products with advanced technologies and features  which provides it a competitive edge  The company remains focused on revolutionizing agriculture with technology in an effort to make farming automated  easy to use and more precise across the production process  Consequently  Deere continues to invest in technology leadership and data analytics Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderDeere currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  A few better ranked stocks in the  sector are Zebra Technologies Corporation   NASDAQ ZBRA    AGCO Corporation   NYSE AGCO   and Cintas Corporation   NASDAQ CTAS    While Zebra Technologies presently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   AGCO and Cintas carry a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   You can see  Zebra Technologies has a projected earnings growth rate of 16 71  for the current year  The stock has gained 28 9  so far this year AGCO has an expected earnings growth rate of 29 5  for the ongoing year  The stock has appreciated 24  over the past year Cintas has an estimated earnings growth rate of 11 15  for 2019  The company s shares have gained 57 0  in the past year The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark

28224,249739,CTAS,Have We Forgotten About China ,opinion,"This was a shortened week due to the Labor Day holiday  but the bulls came out in strength  The S P 500 opened Tuesday at 2909  and closed today at 2979  an increase of 70 points or  2 4  in a single week  SPX had been caught in a trading range from 2822 to 2940 since August 8th  but the market gapped open strongly Thursday morning and solidly broke through the 50 day moving average  dma  at 2944  Lest we get ahead of ourselves  trading volume remains weak  Volume remained below the 50 dma until Thursday  but only touched the average then and dropped back lower today  As the bulls drive this market higher  they do so carefully  They are not  all in  
When we plot the Bollinger bands on the SPX chart with two standard deviations above and below the 20 dma  it makes the significance of this move more apparent  SPX started the week near the center of the bands  but Thursday s price spurt closed outside the upper edge of the Bollinger bands  a relatively rare event  And SPX maintained just enough bullish price action today to close right on the upper edge of those bands  From a statistical  random walk point of view  it will be hard for next week s market to match this week s strong climb higher  
The volatility index for the S P 500 options  VIX  opened this week at 21  and closed today at 15   I regard 15  as the  line in the sand   Volatility levels below 15  are relatively benign  but I start to raise the caution flag above that level  So we are right on the edge  not panicky  but not calm either 
It is old news to observe that the Russell 2000 continues to trade far more weakly than its big brother indices  Whereas SPX gained 2 4  this week  Russell s close today at 1505 represented an increase of only 0 7  for the week  RUT is bouncing off resistance at its 200 dma  That is weak  Russell would have to gain 7 3  just to return to its May highs  And those May highs are far from the all time high set in August of last year at 1741  almost 16  above today s close  These small to mid cap stocks are the  risk on  stocks   a sobering thought 
The NASDAQ Composite index ran parallel to the S P 500 index this week  opening at 7906 and closing today at 8103  up 197 points for the week or  2 4   NASDAQ gapped open on Thursday and solidly broke out above the 50 dma  but it gave back about 14 points of those gains today  NASDAQ s trading volume ran below the 50 dma all week  and was especially low today  The same thing occurred last week and I attributed it to the holiday weekend  This isn t the beginning of another holiday weekend  The bulls may be buying  but they are playing safe 
The China trade negotiations continue to be the principal worry for traders  We are caught in a particularly dangerous market  It will spike higher or lower in seconds on the basis of a tweet or even a rumor  But this market recovers quickly from each rumor or tweet inspired panic  demonstrating a fundamentally bullish posture  Traders exit the market in volume on the least provocation  It remains a twitchy  and therefore dangerous  market 
In my trading group  we play moderately conservative trades  The riskiest trades we enter are plays on a stock s earnings announcement  These trades are riskier than our usual trades simply because they are binary trades   you are either right or wrong  There is no time to hedge or adjust the trade  It is over in 24 to 48 hours 
Earnings trades may be thought of as relatively safe in this volatile market  Getting in and out quickly has a certain appeal  The overall market s twitches are less relevant to these trades  Hence  we only entered three trades this week  two earnings trades on PANW and one earnings play on LULU  I closed one PANW position the next day for a 61  gain  The other PANW trade and the LULU trade will expire worthless this weekend for gains of 18  and 14   respectively 
This is analogous to the day trader  We commonly think of day trading as very risky  but at the end of the trading session  the day trader is safely out of the market  When we are in a volatile and unpredictable market  entering and exiting quickly has its merits 
Limit your trading to stocks that are demonstrating steady strength in the midst of this volatile market  I believe the following stocks meet those criteria   Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc   NYSE CMG   Cintas Corporation  NASDAQ CTAS   HSY  ICE  NYSE ICE   and Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX

28277,249792,CTAS,Construction Demand To Buoy Deere Till Agriculture Picks Up,opinion,Deere   Company s   NYSE DE   Construction   Forestry sales rose 1  year over year to  3 02 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2019  ended Jul 28  2019   In the first three quarters of fiscal 2019  the segment s sales improved 11  from the prior year comparable period This was driven by the Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volume and price realization  somewhat offset by unfavorable foreign exchange  The segment reported operating profit of  378 million  marking an improvement of 35  from the prior year quarter figure of  281 million  So far in the fiscal year  the segment s operating profit improved 66  year over year to  954 million The Wirtgen acquisition contributed  158 million to operating profit in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and  275 million so far in the fiscal year  Apart from this  price realization and higher shipment volume  partially offset by higher production costs and unfavorable effects of currency exchange  drove profits  Operating margin in the quarter was 12 5  compared with 9 4  in the previous fiscal year  marking an expansion of 310 basis points year over year Wirtgen Buyout to Drive Construction   Forestry SegmentDeere projects global sales for the Construction   Forestry segment to rise 10  in fiscal 2019  This will be backed by the Wirtgen acquisition as well as strong demand for equipment  With order books extending into the fourth quarter  the segment seems on track to witness improved results in the second half of the fiscal year In forestry  global industry sales are expected to be flat to up 5   primarily driven by higher demand in EU28 countries and Russia  The segment s operating margin is projected to be about 11   The economic environment for the construction  forestry and road building industries holds promise and continues to support elevated demand for new and used equipment For fiscal 2019  U S  GDP  total construction investments  housing starts and oil activity remain at supportive levels for equipment demand  Equipment rental utilization remains high and rental rates will continue to improve in 2019  Global transportation investment in this calendar year is anticipated to be up about 5   spurring demand for road construction equipment such as milling machines  rollers and asphalt pavers  which are all important product lines for Wirtgen As a reminder  Deere acquired the world s leading road construction equipment maker  Wirtgen  for  5 2 billion in cash and debt in December 2017  The buyout significantly enhanced Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  The company updated its synergy target to 125 million euro by 2022 This upbeat performance helped offset the impact of the ongoing weakness in the agricultural sector on Deere s sales  The Agriculture   Turf segment s sales were down 6  year over year to  5 9 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 while operating profit at the segment declined 24  year over year to  612 million   Prevalent concerns over export market access  near term demand for commodities such as soybeans  and overall crop conditions resulted in farmer s getting cautious about their equipment purchases  Nevertheless  backed by the Construction   Forestry segment s performance  Deere reported third quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of  2 71 per share  an improvement of 5  from the prior year quarter Deere lowered expectation of year over year equipment sales growth to 4  from the previously mentioned 5   The expectation for net income for the fiscal year is now at about  3 2 billion compared with  3 3 billion stated previously  For the Agriculture   Turf segment  Deere projects industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada to be flat in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior fiscal year  The segment s overall fiscal 2019 sales are expected to be up 2  year over year Further  Deere s results continue to bear the brunt of higher costs of raw materials on the implementation of tariffs and logistics  It will likely continue to hinder the company s margins until a resolution is reached Nevertheless  there hope for Deere as well as other stocks   including AGCO Corporation  Lindsay Corporation and Titan International  which have exposure to the agricultural sector  Per the USDA s latest available projections  net farm is anticipated to rise 10  year over year in 2019 to  69 4 billion  after a decline of 16  in 2018  Further  the USDA announced a  16 billion aid program for American farmers  who have been hurt by the U S  trade war with China  This is likely to improve farmer sentiment and bolster equipment sales  Shares of Deere have gained around 10 1  over the

28567,250082,CTAS,Crown Holdings Bets On Rising Demand Amid Higher Input Costs,opinion,On Aug 8  we issued an updated research report on Crown Holdings  Inc    NYSE CCK    The company is well poised to benefit from investment in capacity to meet solid global beverage can demand  strategic acquisitions to increase geographic presence and product line  and focus on cost control  However  near term capacity constraints in Brazil  lower volumes in European food can market  weak Transit Packaging segment performance  and input cost inflation remain near term headwinds Tepid Q2Crown Holdings  second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share declined 5 8  year over year to  1 46  while revenues fell 0 4  to  3 035 million  Unfavorable currency translation impacted the top line  offset by higher beverage can volumes Headwinds to Counter in 2019Crown Holdings now expects adjusted earnings per share to be  5 05  5 20 for 2019  down from the prior range of  5 20 and  5 40  Crown Holdings had reported earnings per share of  5 20 in fiscal 2018  The trimmed guidance is primarily owing to lower than expected full year results in the European Food and Transit Packaging segments The European food can market is a mature market  which has witnessed stable to slightly declining volumes in recent years  The Transit Packaging segment s outlook is cloudy given the slowdown in the global manufacturing activity In the Brazilian markets  can demand remain high but Crown Holdings will be unable to meet the demand owing to shortage of capacity till the new Rio Verde project comes online  Further  the company anticipates a significant reduction in can demand in Columbia in the back half of this year  This along with the capacity constraints in Brazil will impact results for the Americas Beverage segment in the second half from the prior year  Sales unit volumes in the Middle East have declined in the recent years on account of geopolitical tensions Poised Well to Capitalize in Rising DemandCrown Holdings is anticipated to gain from a rise in global beverage can demand  Developing markets have experienced higher growth rates due to rising per capita income and the consequent increase in beverage consumption  While the economies in Europe and North America are more mature  there are still growth opportunities aided by beverages  such as energy drinks  teas  juices  sparkling water and craft beer  and an increased preference for cans over certain other forms of beverage packaging  With its many inherent benefits  including being infinitely recyclable  the beverage can continues to become the increasingly preferred package for marketers and consumers globally To capitalize on this  Crown Holdings intends to build new facilities and is positioned to gain from the geographic expansion of its beverage can lines  To meet volume requirements in the U S  and Canadian beverage can markets  the company has begun construction of a third high speed line at its Nichols  NY facility  which is expected to commence production during the second quarter of 2020  The conversion of an existing two piece steel food can production line at the Weston  Ontario plant  to aluminum beverage cans  is anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2020  Both the Nichols and Weston lines will be capable of producing multiple sizes  Additionally  during the fourth quarter of 2019  the company anticipates beginning operations at a new one line beverage can plant in Rio Verde  Brazil Acquisitions  A Key CatalystIn April 2018  Crown Holdings acquired Signode Industrial Group Holdings  which is a leading global provider of transit packaging systems and solutions  This broad and diversified Crown Holdings  customer base and product offerings will benefit earnings and cash flow in 2019  Further  its previous acquisition of EMPAQUE  a leading manufacturer for the beverage industry in Mexico  reinforced the company s presence in the growing Mexican market Raw Material Inflation is a WoeCrown Holdings uses various raw materials  such as steel  aluminum  tin  water  natural gas  electricity and other processed energy in its manufacturing operations  Cost of these raw materials has flared up owing to the tariffs imposed in the United States  which may escalate costs  The company may not be able to pass through the rise in raw materials costs to customers without suffering losses in unit volume  revenues and operating income  Nevertheless  the company will gain on pricing and cost control efforts Price PerformanceOver the past year

 growth was primarily led by Latin America  which exhibited an improvement of 20   followed by North America with growth of 9   However  these performances were offset by dismal performances in Asia

low  Though demand remains steady in EMEA  political and economic uncertainties remain  In Asia Pacific  regions barring China are expected to grow The Resource Industries segment is expected to

28660,250175,CTAS,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Cintas  CTAS ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cintas  CTAS   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CTAS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uniform rental company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CTAS  shares are up 1 21  over the past week while the Zacks Uniform and Related industry is down 2 66  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 75  compares favorably with the industry s 9 21  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Cintas have risen 20 65   and are up 35 24  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 39  and 8 24   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CTAS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CTAS is averaging 568 606 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CTAS 
Over the past two months  6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CTAS s consensus estimate  increasing from  8 30 to  8 45 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CTAS is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Cintas on your short list ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-cintas-ctas-200441597,200441597
28661,250176,CTAS,Top Stock Reports For Johnson   Johnson  NextEra   Deere,opinion,"Thursday  July 18  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   NextEra  NEE  and Deere  DE   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Johnson   Johnson s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry so far this year   2 2  vs   1 2    J J beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q2 and raised the 2019 guidance for operational sales growth for the second time this year  
The Zacks analyst thinks J J is witnessing significant generic biosimilar headwinds in its Pharma unit in 2019  However  J J s sales and earnings growth is expected to accelerate in 2020 supported by contribution from new drugs like Tremfya and successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and immunology drug  Stelara  
J J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions  It has already gained FDA approval for two new drugs in 2019  Balversa and Spravato  Headwinds like biosimilar generic competition and pricing pressure remain  The talc and opioid litigations are overhangs on the stock 
 You can   
Shares of NextEra have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the past year  gaining  23 3  vs  11 8   The Zacks analyst thinks NextEra s investments to strengthen renewable operations through  30 by 30  plan will help the company to continue as a market leader in renewable power generation  Focus on expanding operations in natural gas pipelines and further expansion of business through acquisitions and organic growth have positively impacted earnings   
However  its nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal  state  and other regulations  Substantial investments are undertaken to ensure the safety of nuclear operations  If planned outages last longer than expected  or there is an unplanned outage normal operations and profitability might be hindered 
 You can   
Deere s shares have gained  16 2  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Farm Equipment industry  which has increased  14 3  over the same period  For fiscal 2019  Deere expects net sales to increase 5  year over year  Concerns stemming from the U S China trade war and lower commodity prices have led to farmers getting cautious about their equipment purchases  
However  the Zacks analyst thinks the  16 billion aid program for American farmers impacted by the trade war is likely to bolster agricultural equipment sales  which bodes well for Deere  Improving construction markets and the Wirtgen acquisition  which has increased Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  will benefit results  
Additionally  introduction of advanced technologies in its products will aid growth  However  raw material cost inflation  elevated expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impact remain near term headwinds

28752,250267,CTAS,Cintas  CTAS  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Cintas  CTAS   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  223 14 in the previous session  Cintas has gained 32 7  since the start of the year compared to the 21 9  move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 29 7  return for the Zacks Uniform and Related industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on March 21  2019  Cintas reported EPS of  1 84 versus consensus estimate of  1 71 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 64  
For the current fiscal year  Cintas is expected to post earnings of  7 46 per share on  6 88 billion in revenues  This represents a 25 59  change in EPS on a 6 22  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  8 3 per share on  7 29 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 22  and 5 98   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Cintas may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Cintas has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 29 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 25 2X versus its peer group s average of 14 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 45  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Cintas fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Cintas shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-05-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cintas-ctas-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200417301,200417301

Trump is desperate to narrow the difference between imports and exports in order to boost its manufacturing sector  He is luring U S  corporate houses to import less and export more  Thus  he has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods  But the issues are beyond trade war  It s also about American might  Otherwise why would there be a U S  government crackdown on Huawei Technologies Co   a Chinese telecommunications giant 
Impact on the Stock Market
The trade war will invariably hurt business confidence and the global economy as a whole  On the one hand  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and FedEx  NYSE FDX  to name a few have repeatedly cautioned that their performance will take a hit due to a slowing Chinese economy  On the other hand  more than 400 Chinese companies said that their earnings will take a beating on trade related issues 
The IMF  by the way  has trimmed global economic growth for this year for the third time in six months predominantly due to trade tensions  Last month  IMF said that global growth would be 3 3  this year  the weakest since 2009  The United States will not be spared either  In fact  Bank of America  NYSE BAC  warned that a trade war  would be much more painful  for the United States  triggering market gyration and denting investors  sentiment  
Stock Market Meltdown in May
Stocks are  in fact  bleeding in the month  After all  the popular axiom  sell in May and go away  has always encouraged investors to sell stock holdings in the month to avoid getting affected by the seasonal decline in equity markets 
The strategy also involves getting back into the equity markets in November  thereby evading the typical volatile May October period  Historically  stocks have underperformed in the six month period commencing May and ending in October  compared to the six month period from November to April 
Mostly lower trading volumes in the summer season and substantial increase in investment during the winter months are cited to be the main reasons behind this discrepancy in returns 
4 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now
With things not looking up for the stock market this May  it s prudent to invest in dividend aristocrats for their risk adjusted returns  These stocks reflect solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals  and are unperturbed by market volatility  This category of stocks also outperforms other dividend payers on better quality business

28756,250271,CTAS,Top Research Reports For Berkshire Hathaway  Pfizer   Danaher ,opinion,"Tuesday  July 16  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Berkshire Hathaway  BRK B   Pfizer  PFE  and Danaher  DHR   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Berkshire Hathaway s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry in the past year   11 2  vs   10 4    The Zacks analyst thinks it is poised for growth over the long term on the back of its sturdy insurance business  The company s inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions  A strong cash position supports earnings accretive bolt on buyouts  Demand for utilities is expected to rise in the future and drive earnings growth  
Continued insurance business growth also fuels its increase in float  The company s non insurance businesses are delivering improved results  supporting overall performance  A sturdy capital level provides further impetus  
However  Berkshire Hathaway s exposure to catastrophe loss remains a concern as its property and casualty insurance business generates maximum return on equity  Also  huge capital expenses due to railroad operations pose a major concern 
 You can   
Shares of Pfizer have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date   0 9  vs   2 1    Pfizer expects continued strong growth of key product franchises  including Ibrance  Eliquis and Xeljanz in 2019  However  the Zacks analyst thinks loss of exclusivity on key drugs in the United States  mainly Lyrica  and currency headwinds will significantly hurt 2019 sales  
Other top line headwinds are weak sales in the sterile injectables portfolio  pricing pressure and rising competition  To offset the threat of generic competition  Pfizer is strengthening its pipeline  It is well positioned to deliver several potentially innovative drugs in the next five years which can drive long term growth 
Biosimilars are also expected to contribute to growth in 2019  Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q2 earnings release  Pfizer has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters 
 You can   
Danaher s shares have gained  13  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has increased  0 2  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks sturdier demand for products  Danaher Business System   DBS   implementation and shareholder friendly policies will likely bolster profitability going forward  
Also  the acquisition of General Electric  NYSE GE  s BioPharma business will boost its biologics workflow solutions business  The divestiture of the dental business will improve competency  
However  rising cost of sales and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies might continue to restrict Danaher s growth  For 2019  the company lowered adjusted earnings per share guidance from  4 75  4 85 to  4 72  4 80  primarily reflecting dilutive impact of funds raised for the BioPharma buyout  Earnings estimates for 2019 have remained stable in the past 60 days

What s Next for Cintas 
While Cintas has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

29075,250590,CTAS,Cintas  CTAS  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Cintas  CTAS  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cintas basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Cintas  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cintas
For the fiscal year ending May       2019  this uniform rental company is expected to earn  7 42 per share  which is a change of 24 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cintas  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Cintas to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-03-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cintas-ctas-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200400680,200400680

29187,250702,CTAS,Cintas  CTAS  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cintas  CTAS   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CTAS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uniform rental company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CTAS  shares are up 0 04  over the past week while the Zacks Uniform and Related industry is down 1 32  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 13 77  compares favorably with the industry s 3 41  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Cintas have risen 3 51   and are up 13 52  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 2  and  2 48   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CTAS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CTAS is currently averaging 490 557 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CTAS 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CTAS s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 24 to  7 35 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period

decline recorded by the  it belongs to Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAlcoa is likely to continue benefiting from its initiatives to reduce complexities of its operations  strengthen its balance sheet and reward shareholders with higher returns  In this regard  over the past couple of years  the company has successfully streamlined its structure and processes and addressed a significant portion of its liabilities  In the third quarter  the company reduced its liability from pensions and other post employment by  500 million on a sequential basis Notably  for 2018  the company increased its adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization projection to  3 1  3 2 billion from  3  3 2 billion stated earlier Alcoa expects global bauxite market to remain in surplus with increasing stockpile growth  The company projects Chinese stockpiles to grow  with a rise in Chinese demand for seaborne bauxite  In addition  the company s decision to invest  100 million will allow it to boost operational efficiencies  enable further cost reductions in its flat rolled business and boost growth in bauxite For the fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Bauxite segment is pegged at  300 million compared with  306 million generated in the year ago quarter In the Alumina segment  Alcoa projects global deficit  primarily induced by disrupted supply in Brazil  The company s own aluminum smelters use most of the alumina produced while the rest is sold globally  Better production volumes and higher prices realized per metric ton will be a boon for the segment s top line In this regard  alumina production in the quarter is anticipated to grow 4 1  sequentially For the fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Alumina segment stands at  1 736 million  higher than  1 517 million generated in the year ago quarter In the Aluminum segment  the company projects a global deficit as well  Notably  the company has reduced its estimates for Chinese aluminum supply on account of curtailments and delayed expansions  Lower metal prices and higher alumina costs in the company s aluminum segment might remain hindrance for Alcoa Additionally  higher raw material costs and energy costs at several of its smelters might have an adverse impact on the company

29223,250738,CTAS,Here s Why Cintas  CTAS  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cintas  NASDAQ CTAS   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CTAS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uniform rental company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CTAS  shares are up 3 03  over the past week while the Zacks Uniform and Related industry is up 1 5  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 57  compares favorably with the industry s 6 57  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Cintas have risen 1 64   and are up 10 12  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  4 65  and  4 45   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CTAS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CTAS is averaging 740 637 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CTAS 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CTAS s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 24 to  7 35 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CTAS is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Cintas on your short list ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-cintas-ctas-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200376079,200376079
29228,250743,CTAS,4 Stocks In Remembrance Of Vanguard Founder John Bogle,opinion,John C  Bogle  father of the index fund  passed away at the age of 89 on Jan 16  He was known for his low cost  buy and

appeal of these funds is that these capture nearly all of a bourses  return ably and inexpensively Bogle always said  Why can t managers beat the market  Where s the value added  In terms of

race  Vanguard was formed in 1974 and began functioning the next year  Investors have put in nearly  5 3 trillion into Vanguard funds  according to the company  Most of the Vanguard funds are managed outside  Unlike other fund families  Vanguard doesn t hire employees to manage funds  Instead  the world s biggest fund family hires managers from outside  This makes it easier to replace the funds in case the manager fails to deliver  This in turn helps to control overall cost of actively managed Vanguard funds When Bogle launched his first fund that tracked the S P 500 index in 1976  it was

29231,250746,CTAS,Will Caterpillar  CAT  Retain Earnings Beat Trend In Q4 ,opinion,Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   is slated to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Oct 28 before the opening bell  Notably  the mining and construction equipment behemoth delivered a year over year improvement of 47  and 18  in earnings and revenues  respectively  in the third quarter of 2018  Both the top and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Continued strength in many of its end markets and persistent focus on cost control aided results  This marked the company s seventh consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth  following a string of dismal performances for four years  Notably  Caterpillar outpaced earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters  recording average positive earnings surprise of 17 10   Consequently  investors are keen on finding out whether Caterpillar will be able to maintain the momentum in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well  Looking at the upbeat estimates for the both earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter  it seems likely that the company will deliver year over year improvement on both metrics  This is also supported by strong fourth quarter projections for its Machinery  Energy   Transportation which generates a major chunk of revenues and earnings  Caterpillar Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s delve deeper and analyze the factors that might influence fourth quarter results Strong Order Growth Will Drive Revenues At the end of third quarter 2018  Caterpillar s order backlog was at  17 3 billion  an improvement of  1 9 billion year over year aided by increase at in segments  This bodes well for performance in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  14 3 billion for the fourth quarter indicates growth of 15 8  from the prior year quarter  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment  which contributed approximately 94  of total revenues in third quarter 2018  is expected to log year over year growth of 12  in revenues to  13 7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018  For the Resource Industries segment  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at  2 786 million  a projected year over year growth of 26   Sales will be driven by continued strong demand for aftermarket parts  Further  miners are resuming capital spending which bodes well for the segment  In the Construction Industries segment  continued improvement in residential and non residential construction in North America will drive revenues  However  the recent slowdown in excavator sales in China is a concern  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Construction segment s sales are projected at  5 981 million for the to be reported quarter  an expected year over year drop of 12   For the Energy   Transportation segment  sales to the Oil and Gas sector is likely to increase in the quarter  aided by stable oil prices  Sales for industrial applications will remain robust  primarily backed by improving global economic conditions and higher end user demand across most applications  Sales to the Transportation sector will benefit primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services  Power Generation sales are improving after a multi year downturn  The segment s sales are expected to grow 22  year over year to  5 726 million in the to be reported quarter  Poised to Deliver Improved Results Despite Inflated Costs Material cost inflation will continue to affect Caterpillar s margins  The impact of recently imposed tariffs was about  40 million in the third quarter of 2018 and is likely to dent its fourth quarter margins as well  The company is also witnessing higher freight rates owing to strained capacity in the trucking industry  less efficient freight loads  and expedited freight as it continues to ramp production to meet increased demand    Given these concerns  the company s share price has slumped 20 3  over the past year while the  witnessed a decline of 23    Nevertheless  Caterpillar has been undergoing significant restructuring and cost reduction initiatives which have been benefiting margins   In fact  the fourth quarter is anticipated to be no exception to the trend  Consequently  strong order flow along  savings from cost reduction and pricing hikes will help counter the impact of higher costs  For the to be reported quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Profit before Taxes for the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment is pegged at  2 208 million  double the  1 091 million reported in the prior year quarter  This can be attributed to a rise of 25  in the Construction segment s operating profit to  1 050 million  per the Zacks Consensus Estimate   Further  the Resource Industries segment is expected to report an operating profit of  427 million  a substantial improvement from the prior year quarter figure of  209 million  The Energy   Transportation segment is anticipated to report operating profit of  1 068 million  a rise of 21  from the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar s earnings is currently pegged at  2 99 for the fourth quarter  The estimate reflects an improvement of 38 4  on a year over year basis  What Our Model Indicates Our proven model suggests that Caterpillar is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported as it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 30   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  Zacks Rank  Caterpillar has a Zacks Rank  3  which  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us confident of earnings beat  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Other Stocks to Consider Here are some other few stocks worth considering as these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  Heritage Crystal Clean  Inc    NASDAQ HCCI   has an Earnings ESP of  1 12  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company s shares have been up 12  in the past year  You can see   Cintas Corporation   NASDAQ CTAS   has an Earnings ESP of  4 87  and a Zacks Rank  2

Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cintas 
For Cintas  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cintas will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cintas would post earnings of  1 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  8 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cintas doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cintas-ctas-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200367845,200367845

29482,250997,CTAS,Why You Shouldn t Bet Against Cintas  CTAS  Stock,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Cintas Corporation   NASDAQ CTAS    This is because this security in the Uniform and Related space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Uniform and Related space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 5 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Cintas is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term Cintas Corporation Price and Consensus   In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from  1 43 per share to  1 65 per share  while current year estimates have risen from  5 45 per share to  5 82 per share  This has helped CTAS to earn a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   further underscoring the company s solid position  You can see  So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Cintas  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-04-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-you-shouldnt-bet-against-cintas-ctas-stock-200303398,200303398
29483,250998,CTAS,Cintas  CTAS  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Cintas   NASDAQ CTAS    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6 7  over the past month  CTAS hit a new 52 week high of  184 68 in the previous session  Cintas has gained 18 4  since the start of the year compared to the  6 4  move for the Industrial Products sector and the 16 1  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on March 22  2018  Cintas reported EPS of  1 37 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 24 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 35  
For the current fiscal year  Cintas is expected to post earnings of  5 83 per share on  6 44 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 97 per share on  6 79 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 19 7  and 5 42   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Cintas may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CTAS  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Cintas has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 31 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 28 2X versus its peer group s average of 18 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 64  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Cintas Corporation Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Cintas meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though CTAS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Cintas Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Cintas have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including KION GROUP   OTC KIGRY    HD Supply Holdings   NASDAQ HDS    and Ashtead  LON AHT  Group   OTC ASHTY    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Cintas  Still  the fundamentals for CTAS are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2018-06-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cintas-ctas-hits-a-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200321898,200321898

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Pfizer  NYSE PFE   FedEx  FDX  and Abbott  ABT   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Pfizer s shares have underperformed the peer group so far this year  the stock is up  12 2  over this period vs  a  16 1  increase for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry   Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio through acquisitions and licensing deals  
However  Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs  supply challenges in the legacy Hospira portfolio  pricing pressure and rising competition  which are hurting the top line  Nonetheless  the Zacks analyst thinks new products like Ibrance  contribution from acquisitions  cost cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance  
The company also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years  including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential  Pfizer s growing immuno oncology portfolio offers a strong potential  Bavencio is being considered a key long term growth driver for Pfizer

Shares of Buy rated FedEx have outperformed the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry and rival United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  on a year to date basis  The company has gained 34 8  while the industry it belongs to and UPS have rallied 14  and 3 2   respectively  in the same period  Ushering in further good news  FedEx also outperformed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 driven by increased package volumes during the current holiday season  
Growth was witnessed across all the major segments of the company  In fact  the strong growth of e commerce is a huge positive for the company  Meanwhile  FedEx is on track to deliver a strong performance in the ongoing holiday season  Efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are also encouraging  High costs are  however  hurting the bottom line 
 You can   
Abbott s shares have gained  8 6  over the last three months  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has gained  3 1  over the same period Post promising third quarter results by Abbott  the Zacks analyst is optimistic about the strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance  However  the ongoing sluggish trend in the Nutrition business is a downside  However  the company continues to benefit from the recently completed St  Jude Medical buyout  
Meanwhile  Alere acquisition close is an upside too  Through 2017  Abbott is effectively focusing on core therapeutic areas  Recently  its FreeStyle Libre Flash received the FDA approval  Also  it has received approval for MR conditional labeling for Ellipse ICD  Also  emerging market performance remains promising on several new strategic developments  On the flip side  sluggish pediatric nutrition business in some global markets continues to dent growth  Also economic problems in Venezuela are likely to remain unresolved

29673,251188,CTAS,Market Pauses As Trump s Agenda Faces First Setback ,opinion,"Leadership is solving problems  The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them  They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care  Either case is a failure of leadership   Colin Powell

In nearly every profession or activity a person will participate in  there will be problems  In sports  teams rarely have undefeated seasons  In business  there will be years when plans do not work and the company may lose money  or have lower cash flow and profits  In politics  a candidate may lose an election  or a piece of legislation may not get passed  hint  hint   Over a long period of time  the entities which wind up achieving far more than the many which fail are organizations which learn from their problems  analyze what went wrong  and find solutions  If you are in business  especially in the investment world  you are trying to find leaders who specialize in solving difficult issues in the toughest of conditions 
Not every business cycle is going to be good  often there are plenty of economic headwinds  Turnaround situations are based on these kind of environments  In the current economic environment  with digital technologies affecting nearly every industry  I look for people who are cool under fire  who don t get rattled  who have poise  I also want people who are quiet and who stick to their strategies  When you have an organization that is confident in the underlying philosophy and strategy  it ain t going to change  Solving problems remains as important a competency as there is for any leader in competitive areas 
In the markets this week  Ford  NYSE F  announced it was reducing earnings estimates for the rest of the year  Many are concerned about a slowdown in new and used car sales  an early indication we may be on the downward slope of the auto cycle  In the housing sector  both KB Home  NYSE KBH  and Lennar  NYSE LEN  exceeded expectations as the industry continues to grapple with a high base of millenials more interested in renting than buying  Cintas  NASDAQ CTAS  and Five Below  NASDAQ FIVE  also performed nicely as uniforms and cheap wares remain recession proof industries  Conversely  The Finish Line Inc  NASDAQ FINL  demonstrated retail remains extremely challenged  I know  you ve heard it before  one too many times  Probably a very good opportunity for a problem solving management team  right 
In the financing arena  a few weeks ago I read about the trend for large corporations like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Pfizer  NYSE PFE   and Verizon to issue debt in Taiwan  The bonds are called Formosa issues  with a length generally of 30 years  and the key feature  from an issuer standpoint  is the terms are in non Taiwanese currency  and are for greater than five years  The reason why companies are issuing this paper is because with potential tax law changes looming  more in a second on that one  it is better to lock in the favorable terms now  4 3 4 9  borrowing rates  in dollars  Better to minimize the risk of an unpredictable government event than watch the politicians screw up for the umpteenth time in a row 
Speaking of the government  Mr  Trump signed the approval of the Keystone Pipeline  which is a big win for the country in terms of providing much needed transport infrastructure to move oil south from Canada to our various refining hubs  Mr  Trump also heralded the job in sourcing of our friends from Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   which will spend  25 billion over the next five years to help fortify their network  Maybe Mr  Trump found more in common with Charter because of their use of tax loss carry forwards  which dwarf what Donald was able to use a few years ago  Great minds think alike  eh 
Regarding the failure of the Republicans to even get a bill through the House which could repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  the rift between moderate and hard right segments of the party remains an ongoing concern  When you get zero members from the other group participating  the mountain is much harder to climb if you have a complicated piece of legislation  The same situation exists with tax reform  as expect no help from Democrats on anything  One has to expect the Freedom Caucus will hem and haw over adding anything to our debt obligations  and the health care failure means Republican leadership is now under increased pressure  The obvious beneficiaries of the results are the hospital and big pharmaceutical industries  which will now face no changes for the foreseeable future  One guy who will see ongoing heat is Paul Ryan  as will Reince Priebus  best buddy of Ryan and Chief of Staff  It could be Steve Bannon could find increased importance in the administration as the tax battle begins 
Finally  this week was the last annual meeting for outgoing Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  CEO Howard Schultz  He faced criticism for his support of immigrants and the inclusive philosophy which permeates the Starbucks organization  His answer is to point out the 180X return on SBUX stock over the 25 year life of the public company  1K turns into 180K   A fine example of leadership  but I am biased as a long time owner  I suspect the stock won t duplicate those results over the next twenty five years  but I ll take my chances

29676,251191,CTAS,Top Analyst Reports For Procter   Gamble  Verizon   Citigroup ,opinion,"Friday July 7 2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Procter   Gamble  PG   Verizon  VZ   and Citigroup  C   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Procter   Gamble s shares have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in the past year   1 9  vs   1 4    However  P G shares have underperformed the S P 500 index in the year to date period  up  3 9  vs   7 8    The company has been struggling to boost market growth for the last few quarters  Also  significant negative forex impact has been hurting sales  But the Zacks analyst likes the fact that P G is speeding up innovations and investments to counter softening industry growth  Its productivity improvements and aggressive cost saving efforts are also consistently helping to boost profit levels 
 You can  
Shares of Verizon shares have been laggards over the past year    the stock is down  22 1  over the past 12 months vs  AT T  NYSE T  s  12 7  decline and the  13  gain for the S P 500 index  Verizon s underperformance reflects the market s concerns about the company s muddled strategy in the digital media domain and rising competitive pressures in its core U S  wireless business 
The Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  purchase  as well as other previously acquired digital properties like AOL  Huffington Post will boost its digital media suite  The long term expectation is that these assets will give it a sizable enough platform to capture digital marketing dollars  The jury is still out on the long term viability of these efforts  but the company is also trying to be a player in the online TV streaming space and defend its leadership position in the wireless market through 5G wireless network trials 
The company s dividend appears safe  currently yields more than 5    but the inherent capital intensity of its core business and the need for purchases on the digital side ends up eating up more than it generates in its operations  In the updated research report issued today  the Zacks analyst discusses the pros and cons of investing in Verizon shares at present 
 You can  
Citigroup s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Major Regional Banks industry over the last six months  gaining  13 1  vs  6 8   The Zacks analyst likes the company s restructuring and streamlining efforts  strategic investments in core business and expense management  The recent Fed approval of the company s 2017 capital plan is also encouraging  Moreover  the passage of the Financial Choice Act will act as a tailwind for the company in coming quarters  However  several issues including litigation burden provide cause for concern  Margins remain under pressure despite rising rates

29769,251284,CTAS,3 Things To Know About Q1 Earnings Season,opinion,"The following is an excerpt from this week s Earnings Trends article  To see the full article   
We are still a few days away from the end of the March quarter  but the 2015 Q1 earnings season has already gotten underway  We have seen results from 8 S P 500 members and the tally will reach 19 by the end of the month  Please note that all of these early reports are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in February  we count all of these as part of our Q1 tally  The actual results from these early reporters appear good enough in terms of growth rates and beat ratios  But investors seem unimpressed with the results thus far  The  price impact  column in the summary table below for the 8 S P 500 members clearly shows investors  disappointment with the result thus far  particularly for FedEx  NYSE FDX   Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  and Cintas  NASDAQ CTAS  
 As we all know  estimates for Q1 took a lot of beating over the last few months  with many suspecting that the negative revisions trend may have gone a bit too far  But judging from the market s reaction to the admittedly small sample of reports  expectations may not be low enough  That said  it is way too early a stage to analyze the Q1 results  For the 2015 Q1 earnings season as a whole  here are the 3 key points to keep in mind First  the magnitude of negative revisions for Q1 is greater than what we have seen for any other recent quarter  The Energy sector is undoubtedly the big reason why the revisions trend for Q1 stands out to this extent  but the picture isn t much better outside of the Energy sector either 
The chart below shows the evolution of 2015 Q1 total earnings growth estimates  with and without the Energy sector 

Second  it s not just the growth rate that is so low in Q1  total aggregate earnings for the S P 500 companies are expected to be the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2012  Aggregate earnings have been in record territory in recent quarters  with each of the preceding three quarters producing all time record quarterly totals  The chart below shows the aggregate earnings tally for the S P 500 index

Third  growth estimates for the first half of the year have taken a severe beating over the last few months  with positive growth estimates getting replaced by outright earnings declines  The chart below shows the evolution of 2015 Q1 and Q2 earnings growth estimates since mid December 2014  As you can see  positive growth in the first half of the year has evaporated 

The revisions trend has been negative for more than two years now  with the trend gaining pace over the last few months under the combined effect of energy sector weakness  dollar strength  and global growth worries  The resulting negative tone of management guidance notwithstanding  estimates for outer quarters still represent a material ramp up in growth going forward  with estimates for 2015 Q4 representing a new all time quarterly record  What this means is that there is still plenty of downside risk to estimates for the coming quarters

29770,251285,CTAS,Cintas  Streak Of 31 Consecutive Years Of Increases,opinion,"The company also sells business products and services  including 

Safety services
First aid products
Restroom supplies
Document management
Fire protection products

Cintas  O CTAS  was founded in 1929 as Acme Industrial Laundry Company  Cintas went public in 1983 and now has a market cap of  9 6 billion 
Cintas has a streak of 31 consecutive years of dividend increases  The company s long dividend streak makes Cintas a member of the exclusive Dividend Aristocrats Index 

Cintas Business Overview
Cintas  operations are divided into 3 segments  Each segment is shown below  along with the percentage of total pretax income generated from each segment 

Uniform Rental and Facility Services generates 87  of pretax income
First Aid and Safety Services generates 6  of pretax income
All Other generates 7  of pretax income

Cintas generates the vast majority of its income from its rental uniform business  This business line is the core of what Cintas is 
Competitive Advantage
Cintas competitive advantage comes from its established local delivery routes and network of processing facilities  The company s employee and location count are shown below 

8 000 delivery routes
364 operating facilities
8 distribution centers
32 000 employees  only 200 union employees 

It would require a large amount of up front capital to compete effectively with Cintas in business uniform services in North America  Cintas is the largest business of its kind in North America 
The company has a scale based competitive advantage that is very difficult for potential competitors to replicate 
Growth Prospects and Total Return
Cintas has grown earnings per share at 6 6  a year over the last decade 
The company has reduced its share count by 4 1  a year over the same time period  About two thirds of Cintas  growth has been driven by share repurchases rather than organic growth 
Going forward  Cintas will likely continue to grow at about the same pace it has over the last decade 
The company s long term organic growth is in line with overall business growth in the United States  Demand for uniform services somewhat tracks the overall economy 
As businesses prosper  they hire more employees and need more laundering services  When the economy contracts  employees are laid off  and less laundering is required 
Shareholders should expect total returns of 6 2  to 8 2  a year going forward from Cintas  Total returns will come from 

Share repurchases of 3  to 4  a year
Organic growth of 2  to 3  a year
Dividend yield of 1 2 

Dividend Analysis
Cintas currently has a dividend yield of just 1 2   The company has a low payout ratio of around 37  
Cintas  dividend payments are in no danger of being cut due to the company s low payout ratio and consistent growth 
The company s low yield and payout ratio are somewhat misleading  as management rewards shareholders with strong share repurchases rather than dividends 
Going forward  Cintas will likely raise its dividend payments slightly faster than overall company growth due to its fairly low payout ratio 
I expect dividend per share growth of around 10  a year over the next several years due to growth and modest payout ratio expansion  The company has grown its dividend payments at around 10  a year over the last decade  and recently hiked its dividend by 23 5  
Despite solid dividend growth  the company s low yield makes it unappealing for investors seeking current income  Additionally  the company only pays dividends once per year  meaning investors seeking more regular dividend income should look elsewhere 
Recession Performance
Cintas remained profitable through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 
As mentioned earlier in this article  the company s growth tracks overall economic activity  As a result  Cintas saw downturns in its earnings per share in 2009 at the peak of the Great Recession 
The company s earnings per share for 2007 through 2012 are shown below to give you an idea of how long it took the company to recover to new earnings per share highs after the Great Recession 

2007 earnings per share of  2 09  new high 
2008 earnings per share of  2 15  new high 
2009 earnings per share of  1 83  recession decline 
2010 earnings per share of  1 49  recession low 
2011 earnings per share of  1 68  partial recovery 
2012 earnings per share of  2 27  full recover  new high 

Cintas  recovery was delayed as businesses were hesitant to hire new employees until well after the Great Recession ended 
Share repurchases helped boost earnings per share  On a net income basis  not including share repurchases   Cintas did not hit new highs from 2009 earnings lows until 2013  The company does grow over the long run  but it is susceptible to economic downturns which delay growth 
Cintas  Valuation
Cintas has historically traded for a price to earnings multiple in line with the S P 500 

S P 500 currently has a price to earnings ratio of 21 3
Cintas currently has a price to earnings ratio of 25 9

Cintas is currently trading at a 1 2x premium to the S P 500  The company s long term expected total return is around what one would expect from the S P 500  if not a bit below it  
If the S P 500 were to fall to its historical average price to earnings ratio of 15 6  Cintas would look very overvalued at current prices  Even in today s  premium value  market  due to low interest rates   Cintas appears to be overvalued 
Final Thoughts
Cintas has a durable competitive advantage and operates in a slow changing industry that will likely continue far into the future  It s difficult to fathom the need for laundering services to somehow go away 
It is hard to imagine a world where employees no longer need to wear uniforms  as a result  Cintas will likely continue to grow for many years to come 
The company s low yield make it a poor choice for investors seeking current income  Additionally  Cintas is likely overvalued at current prices  The company ranks in the bottom 50  of stocks with 25  years of dividend payments without a reduction using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing 
Potential investors in this stable business should wait until the company s price to earnings ratio falls in line  or below  the S P 500 s price to earnings ratio before initiating a position in Cintas ",2015-12-23,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrats-part-37:-cintas-377273,377273
29771,251286,CTAS,CTAS  A Stodgy Dividend Growth Investment,opinion,"Cintas  O CTAS  is one of the highest scoring dividend stocks in our database for Dividend Safety  98  and Dividend Growth  99   The company has proven to be an extremely durable business with roots dating back nearly 90 years  and it has rewarded its shareholders with higher dividend payments for 32 consecutive years 
This is really one of the most consistent sales and earnings growers around  and it operates in a very slow changing industry where it maintains leading market share  At the right price  we would certainly considering owning CTAS in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewCTAS started out as a laundry service for businesses during the Great Depression and has grown to become the largest provider of uniform programs in North America  As the company has grown  it has added facility services  first aid and safety services  entrance mats  restroom supplies  document management  fire protection  and more to its offerings 
Today  CTAS serves over one million business customers and clothes more than five million workers every day in North America  Approximately 70  of its customers are in the service providing sector of the economy  and the remaining 30  are in goods producing industries such as oil  gas  coal  construction  and manufacturing Business AnalysisIn some ways  CTAS s business is comparable to a garbage collection company  The business provides each worker with enough uniforms for two weeks  One clean set is for his current workweek  while the other is being laundered and repaired by CTAS 
CTAS will send a rep to the customer s facility to pick up worn garments and drop off each worker s clean uniforms for the next week 
It doesn t take a genius to do laundry  so this commodity business is all about efficiency and being the low cost provider in a particular area  friendly service reps help  too  
With weekly stops made at every customer  route density is the best way to achieve lower costs than competitors because the cost of transportation  i e  truck trips  can be spread across numerous customers  To accomplish this  CTAS has over 350 distribution facilities and more than 8 000 local delivery routes  Some customers prefer or need to do business with larger players that have more of a nationwide reach  and being closer to customers also results in better service because delivery times are shorter 
Smaller competitors will have miniscule margins if they try to compete in one of CTAS s established areas because their transportation and operating costs are higher  They would also have to disrupt long standing relationships that CTAS s reps have with each customer  although we view that as a smaller competitive advantage  On the other hand  CTAS has the luxury of acquiring these companies to gain new geographies and increase its network density in existing regions  realizing meaningful cost synergies for the acquired businesses 
Once CTAS has a local area locked down for business  it can work on increasing its amount of sales with each customer by offering new products and services such as restroom supplies  document management  and tile cleaning  By offering a wider range off products and services to its customers  CTAS can increase the productivity of its reps  lower its customers  costs  and create stickier customer relationships 
While it is very competitive and sensitive to price  the rental uniform market has a very slow pace of change and provides an essential service   we don t believe the majority businesses will start doing their employees  laundry in house anytime soon  Furthermore  many of the industries in need of rental uniforms experience high employee turnover  which drums up even more business for companies like CTAS 
These factors have created a relatively stable competitive environment that has helped CTAS gradually grow in size over the decades and give us greater confidence in the company s long term relevance  With less than 10  share in a market greater than  40 billion in size  CTAS has plenty of room for growth  We also like the company s diversification in that no customer accounts for over 1  of its total sales and no end market is greater than 10  of revenue Key RisksWe believe CTAS has a lower fundamental risk profile than many other companies  However  its results can be impacted by employment trends  fuel and energy costs  and the health of its end markets  e g  low oil prices is hurting demand from its oil and gas customers as they reduce their headcount  
However  we don t believe any of these factors impair CTAS s long term outlook  If anything  they could be buying opportunities for patient dividend growth investors 
The longer term issues that could hurt the company s earnings growth are continued outsourcing of U S  manufacturing jobs and a potential change in the way businesses choose to dress their employees 
The strong U S  dollar and higher labor costs have made domestic manufacturers less competitive than overseas competitors  resulting in numerous factory closures and companies choosing to offshore or outsource their operations  Should these trends continue  it could hurt CTAS s business with goods producing customers  roughly 30  of its sales  
Not unlike consumers  businesses could also begin to develop a change in taste for their work environments and try to increase employee morale by moving away from uniforms altogether 
However  CTAS s strong diversification  low market share  and continued opportunities for acquisitions largely mitigate these concerns Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend 
Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
CTAS s dividend is extremely safe with a Safety Score of 98  It scores highly because of its low payout ratios  recession resistant business  consistent free cash flow generation  and healthy balance sheet 
CTAS s earnings and free cash flow payout ratios over the last 12 months are 19  and 37   respectively  As seen below  CTAS s earnings payout ratio has remained between 20  and 30  most years  which provides plenty of safety and room for continued dividend growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends

During the last recession  CTAS s sales fell by 4  in fiscal year 2009 and 6  in fiscal year 2010  However  the company s free cash flow per share actually grew in each of those years  highlighting the defensiveness of CTAS s business model  While many businesses lay off some employees during economic downturns  their remaining employees still need their uniforms laundered Source  Simply Safe Dividends
CTAS has also done an excellent job generating and growing free cash flow over the last decade  The best business models generate real cash each year that can be used for growth  acquisitions in the case of CTAS  and rewarding shareholders with higher dividends Source  Simply Safe Dividends
CTAS has created value for shareholders by earning a healthy return on invested capital over the last decade  Earning a double digit return is very good for such a simple business and highlights the company s competitive advantages Source  Simply Safe Dividends
We can also see that CTAS s balance sheet is in good shape  The company has about  670 million in cash compared to  1 3 billion in debt  Its free cash flow easily covers its dividend payments and interest expense  and Moody s assigned the company an  A2  credit rating last year  CTAS has plenty of firepower to continue acquiring smaller rivals without jeopardizing the dividend Source  Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
CTAS has some of the best dividend growth potential of any stock with a Dividend Growth Score of 99  The company is a dividend aristocrat and raised its dividend by 24  in 2015  marking its 32nd consecutive annual dividend increase 
CTAS has grown its dividend by 15  and 13  per year over the last 5  and 10 year periods  respectively  With a long runway for steady earnings growth and relatively low payout ratios  we expect dividend growth to continue at a healthy double digit rate for the foreseeable future ValuationCTAS trades at about 21x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 1 2   which is slightly lower than its five year average dividend yield of 1 3  
The company s dividend yield is low because it doesn t pay out much of its earnings  Instead  it is reinvesting back into the business for long term growth  This is the appropriate strategy given CTAS s good returns on invested capital and has resulted in double digit earnings growth historically 
Given the size of the company s markets  the slow changing nature of the industry  and CTAS s advantages as the largest player  we think the company will continue generating at least a high single digit earnings growth over the next five years 
If this plays out  the company appears to offer 8 10  total return potential  However  we would like to buy the stock at an earnings multiple below 20 ConclusionCTAS is a boring yet remarkable business  Few companies have survived for so long doing basically the same thing  especially something so simple as providing uniforms and doing laundry   We think this blue chip dividend stock has a bright future ahead of it and will watch closely for an attractive entry price ",2016-01-29,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ctas:-a-stodgy-dividend-growth-investment-382382,382382
29772,251287,CTAS,This Business Services Play Is About To March Higher,opinion,"Cintas Corporation  NASDAQ CTAS  was a steady riser over the last 4 years  That changed last March as the move higher shifted to more of a sideways consolidation followed by a couple of small steps higher  The final step lasted until the end of 2015  With the turn of the calendar  the uniform maker s stock price started to plummet  finding a bottom in mid January 
A bounce brought the price back to the flat 200 day SMA at the start of February  retracing about half of the move down  The price failed to push higher there and then fell back to the prior low by President s Day  But since then it has been rising    again  This time it has moved over the high at the beginning of February and the 200 day SMA 

This higher high triggers a buy signal and looks for the price to retrace the full move lower in what would be a  W  up to 93 50  The 100 day SMA appears to be in the way and a gap from 89 75 to 90 95  But momentum supports a push higher with the RSI rising in the bullish zone and the MACD rising and positive  The Bollinger Bands  have also opened and price is riding them higher  Consider using the B point as a stop and get long now or over the 100 day SMA for a trade higher ",2016-03-08,Gregory W.
