Continuing yesterday s trend  it was mostly a quiet session for FX in Asia due to a lack of economic data and general news flow  Until Westpac forecast RBA to cut 2x and begin QE by June 2020  This follows on from Dr Lowe s speech yesterday where he effectively ruled out negative rates  yet left room for further cuts and the potential for QE  but not until rates hit 0 25   AUD was quick to react and shed 20 pips and is now the weakest major of the session  AUD NZD touched a 3 month low AUD is the weakest major and USD is the strongest  volatility remains contained overall though with daily ranges around 20 50  of the ATR s  AUD USD is the biggest decliner  EUR AUD is the leader of the back with NZD JPY a close 2nd Positive comments from Trump on trade saw NZD JPY touch is highest level since August 2nd  yet the small range with 70 27 resistance nearby makes it vulnerable to a dip lower Construction work done in Q3 beat expectations  by only contracting by  0 4  versus  1 0  expected  It s a minor victory at best though  as the sector has contracted for the past 5 quarters  Price Action

164873,386389,LOW,RBA Holds Rates  Could Still  Ease  Their Way Into 2020,opinion,"In the final meeting of the year  the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  decided to keep rates on hold 0 75   whilst keeping the door open for further cuts 
What made this meeting more interesting was that it followed on from Lowe s  NYSE LOW  highly anticipated speech last week  titled  Unconventional Monetary Policy  Some Lessons From Overseas   After all but ruling out negative rates and saying they were extraordinarily unlikely to happen  he clearly stated that QE would not occur until rates were at 0 25   This leaves two  25b bps cuts still on on the table 
So today was all about if the RBA were going to cut sooner or later in 2021  as expectations for a cut today were only around 9   Upon first glance  the central bank s statement is its usual reserved format with talk of the  gentle turning point  with the economy and expectations for growth  inflation and unemployment data to improve  Yet these weak targets  compared with Dr Lowe s  NYSE LOW  comments that the RBA will implement QE if they re not on track to meet their objectives over the medium term  makes us struggle to see how they ll sit on their hands through most of next year  If anything  today s statement reinforces the view that RBA could ease as early as Q1 2020 
Still  markets are bid the Aussie over the near term which provides bullish opportunities  so long as today s GDP data and Thursday s retail sales allow  Yet there s potential for GDP to hold up looking at today s trade figures and provide another tailwind for AUD 




AUD NZD is enjoying a very minor rally at the lows of an extended  bearish leg  Due to the lack of retracements and the fact that RSI reached its most oversold level this year  then a corrective bounce could be due  Yet we expect it to be short lived  so remains a pair to consider fading into as this still could form new lows 




AUD JPY finally burst above the resistance levels highlighted yesterday and appears set to challenge 75  Given that the bullish trendline held and we ve now seen a solid breakout from compression  the cross could be headed for the highs around 75 50 is sentiment allows

164900,386416,LOW,RBA Chief Sees Australia Economy Picking Up  Fails to Signal Imminent Cut,news," Bloomberg     Australia s central bank chief Philip Lowe reiterated that his economy is at a  gentle turning point  and gave little indication that an interest rate cut was in the immediate offing  potentially disappointing economists expecting one within days 
 At our board meeting next week  we will again take stock of the evidence   the Reserve Bank governor said in the text of a speech Tuesday in Armidale  a regional city in northern New South Wales   Further monetary easing may well be required  While we are at a gentle turning point and expect growth to pick up  the strength and durability of this pick up remains to be seen  
Lowe eased in June and July to 1  and reaffirmed    as he did again Tuesday    that an extended period of low rates was on the cards  as ongoing uncertainty abroad and weak household spending at home drag on the economy  The governor noted that over the past year there has been  no growth at all in consumption per person   a result he described as unusual given hiring has remained strong 
The Australian dollar rose on Lowe s  NYSE LOW  comments  buying 68 05 U S  cents at 8 13 p m  in Sydney  compared with 67 85 cents before their release 
In predicting an upturn in the economy  the RBA chief noted that GDP growth over the first half of this year was stronger than in the second half of 2018 and said the RBA is expecting  a further modest pick up  in the quarters ahead 
That s based on his frequently mentioned combination of tailwinds  rate cuts and tax refunds  a weaker currency  and infrastructure and mining investment  Lowe estimates that the government s cash rebate will boost aggregate household income by 0 6  this year  adding that past experience suggests that around half of the tax refunds will be spent 
In addition  there hasn t been  the same spike in the measure of policy uncertainty in Australia  seen in the world economy  he said   There has  however  been some softening in measures of business conditions  
Reluctant Cutter
The RBA s back to back rate cuts have already begun to show up in a strengthening Sydney and Melbourne property market  but are likely to take longer to flow through the economy  perhaps explaining the reluctance to resume easing so soon 
Still  Lowe highlighted that while Australia s floating exchange rate gave it some policy flexibility  as a small  open economy it can t remain impervious to what global central banks are doing  This month both the U S  and Europe have eased in response to international volatility  from the U S  China confrontation to Brexit to Hong Kong to South Korea Japan  that s discouraging investment 
Curiously  while the governor mentioned the economy s  gentle turning point  three times in his address  reiterating a comment from August  he failed to call on the government to increase fiscal support for the first time in a while  That likely reflects a realization that with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg recommitting to a budget surplus in fiscal 2020 and maintaining the government is doing enough to support the economy  there s little to be gained 
 Regardless of the short term outlook for monetary policy  the point about the solution to low global rates is relevant here in Australia too   Lowe said   We will all be better off if businesses have the confidence to expand  invest  innovate and hire people  Given Australia s strong fundamentals  this is not out of our reach  but it does require constant effort

Lowe s shares have added about 22 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 24 5  
What s Next for Lowe s 
While Lowe s has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

164950,386466,LOW,Australia Sees Jobs Boom in West as Resources Comeback on Cards,news," Bloomberg     Employment jumped and the labor force swelled in Australia s western mining heartland  offsetting job losses in every other state  suggesting forecasts of a resource investment revival might be coming to pass 
In Western Australia  13 800 jobs were added in June  the participation rose 0 3 percentage point and unemployment fell almost half a percentage point to 5 8   data from the statistics bureau showed in Sydney Thursday  In contrast  New South Wales  the economy s growth driver in recent years and Australia s biggest state  shed 17 400 positions 
 The pickup in full time hiring in Western Australia may be a sign that the trough in resource investment may soon come to an end   said Tamara Mast Henderson  an economist at Bloomberg Economics   There was less slack in Australia s labor market in June  as indicated by a drop in underutilization  This adds to reasons the Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to leave its policy rate unchanged in August  We don t expect any more easing this year  
The RBA executed its first back to back interest rate cuts in seven years as it redoubled efforts to drive unemployment down to 4 5   the bank s new estimate of the rate needed to reignite inflation  It s betting that a combination of policy easing  government tax cuts  infrastructure investment  and firms upgrading and building new mines will reignite an economy that slowed sharply in recent quarters 
Rising Salaries
BHP Group and  Rio Tinto   LON RIO  Group  the world s two largest miners  are among those with vast new operations under construction in Western Australia s Pilbara region as they prepare to replace aging mines scheduled to shutter  Rising salaries in the state s mining sector already reflect a tighter labor market  with some roles commanding higher wages than at the peak of the last mining investment boom  according to advisory firm BDO International Ltd 
Perth based Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  has pledged project spending of about A 5 5 billion   3 9 billion  on two new iron ore mines in Australia in the past 18 months  while BHP is developing the  3 billion South Flank project and Rio has sanctioned the  2 6 billion Koodaideri mine 
The Australian dollar climbed after the release and traded at 70 26 U S  cents at 12 50 p m  in Sydney  Money markets are pricing in about a 60  chance the central bank will cut rates by another quarter point in December  The cash rate is currently at a record low 1  
Thursday s report also showed positive data on slack in the labor market  under employment declined 0 4 percentage point to 8 2  and underutilization fell 0 3 point to 13 4  
RBA Governor Philip Lowe s  NYSE LOW  lowering of estimated full employment in the economy follows in the footsteps of other developed world counterparts  who ve had to wait for their jobless rates to fall to exceptionally low levels to spur wage growth  Even then  it has proved a prolonged wait for it to feed into inflation 
Pushing down the jobless rate is likely to prove an uphill battle    not least because so many additional people are entering the labor market  Meanwhile  debt laden households have hunkered down and cut spending as they grapple with stagnant incomes and weakening house prices erode their wealth 
The labor market has held up surprisingly well even as the economy slowed sharply in the past 12 months  One explanation for the resilience is that much of the hiring is coming from government related programs that are impervious to prevailing economic conditions ",2019-07-17,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/australia-sees-jobs-boom-in-west-as-resources-comeback-on-cards-1926886,1926886
164952,386468,LOW,Lowe s  LOW  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Lowe s  LOW  reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 34 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 9  
Revenues are expected to be  17 71 billion  up 1 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 38  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lowe s 
For Lowe s  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 62  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Lowe s will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lowe s would post earnings of  2 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 15  delivering a surprise of  7 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lowe s appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lowes-low-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200485055,200485055

164964,386480,LOW,Australia Cuts Key Rate to Record Low  Ending Near 3 Year Pause,news," Bloomberg     Australia cut interest rates for the first time in almost three years to guard against a darkening global backdrop and attempt to revive slowing inflation and economic growth at home 
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe made his first adjustment to the cash rate since taking the helm in September 2016  cutting by a quarter point to 1 25  Tuesday as expected by money markets and economists  They also see the central bank following up with another cut within three months 
 Today s decision to lower the cash rate will help make further inroads into the spare capacity in the economy   Lowe said in his post meeting statement   It will assist with faster progress in reducing unemployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target   The governor didn t provide any new forward guidance 
Lowe s  NYSE LOW  cut comes against the backdrop of an intensifying trade dispute between the world s economic superpowers and signs of weakness emerging in Australia s previously roaring jobs market  The economy slowed in recent quarters as tumbling property prices    led by a 15  fall in Sydney    left households feeling poorer and weighed on consumer spending 
 The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for household consumption  which is being affected by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices   Lowe said   Some pick up in growth in household disposable income is expected and this should support consumption  
The Australian dollar rose  buying 69 92 U S  cents at 2 35 p m  in Sydney compared with 69 75 cents before the decision 
Still  an easing of lending rules combined with the well flagged prospect of rate cuts may have encouraged buyers back into the housing market  where price falls are slowing  Along with a boost of confidence from Prime Minister Scott Morrison s center right government s surprise re election last month    on a platform of tax cuts    the short term prospects look brighter 
But structural problems remain  Data out Wednesday is likely to show GDP rose an annual 1 8  in the first three months of this year  almost a percentage point below the economy s speed limit  The central bank needs growth of more than 2 75  in order to soak up spare capacity and drive down unemployment 
The RBA is betting that if the jobless rate grinds lower  workers will eventually be emboldened to ask for larger pay rises and price pressures will then flow through to inflation  Price growth has largely stayed below the bottom of the central bank s target inflation range of 2 3  for the past five years 
More worryingly  a report Monday showed an 8 4  slump in job advertisements  which suggests the RBA might need to work on reviving the labor market before it can make headway on lowering unemployment ",2019-06-04,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/australia-cuts-key-rate-to-record-low-ending-near-3year-pause-1887097,1887097
164966,386482,LOW,Australia s Economy Expands at Slowest Pace in Decade on Housing,news," Bloomberg     Australia s economy expanded at the slowest pace in almost a decade as a prolonged housing downturn weighed on consumer spending  underscoring the central bank s decision to lower interest rates 
Gross domestic product advanced 0 4  in the first three months of the year from the prior quarter  statistics bureau data showed in Sydney  The economy grew just 1 8  from a year earlier  the weakest reading since the global financial crisis  as households boosted their savings and cut spending in a classic response to wealth erosion 
 The data confirm that the economy started 2019 very softly   said Sarah Hunter  head of macroeconomics at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney   Consumers continue to be battered by weak income growth  and this was added to by the drag from sharply falling house prices  
The currency was little changed after the GDP release 
The report comes a day after the Reserve Bank cut rates for the first time in almost three years to revive consumption that accounts for almost 60  of GDP  and spur economic growth  Governor Philip Lowe says the easing should encourage hiring and investment and help lower unemployment  The wild card is the escalating trade war between the U S  and China 
The rise in protectionism has prompted Lowe s  NYSE LOW  U S  counterparts to consider reversing some of last year s tightening  Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell signaled overnight an openness to cut if necessary  pledging to closely watch the fallout from disputes between the U S  and its largest trading partners 
Lowe is expected to ease again this year    with a better than 60  chance of an August cut    to bring the cash rate to a new record low 1   Such a level  together with an easing of lending restrictions  should help put a floor under tumbling property prices that have prompting consumers to rein in spending  In Sydney  housing has fallen 15  
Wednesday s report showed government spending and exports were key drivers of the expansion  adding 0 2 percentage point apiece  Dwelling investment fell 2 5  and home ownership transfer costs slumped 13  amid the property downturn  collectively shaving 0 3 percentage point from economic growth 
The household savings ratio advanced to 2 8  from a revised 2 6  in the final three months of the year 
Australia s economy is on the cusp of 28 years of expansion  a developed world record  but growth drivers are thinning with the end of the mining and property booms  Government investment in infrastructure has become an important source of growth and hiring and Lowe  in a speech Tuesday night  encouraged it to keep stoking the economy 
Unemployment Focus
The RBA needs the economy expanding at 3  or more to drive the jobless rate down to 4 5   the level at which Lowe now believes will stoke consumer prices sufficiently to return inflation to the central bank s 2 3  target  But outside government spending and high resource prices    reflected in the terms of trade jumping 3 1  in the quarter    the economy looks moribund 
 For the RBA  today s data are slightly below its May forecast profile for growth  but recent comments indicate that it remains more focused on the unemployment rate   said Kaixin Owyong  markets economist at National Australia Bank Ltd   The RBA will likely be relieved not to make another major change to its growth outlook  although the governor has emphasized that its outlook is conditioned on the cash rate falling to 1   
Unemployment climbed to 5 2  in April and job advertisements slumped 8 4  in May  a potential harbinger to further weakness in the labor market 
What Bloomberg s Economists Say
 Several factors may boost household spending and investment in the second half  The government has promised tax cuts and the housing market is showing signs of stabilization  Additional easing may also be in the pipeline

The RBA had incorporated a softening of the economy in the first half of the year in its most recent forecasts  predicting 1 75  growth in the 12 months through June before accelerating to 2 75  at the end of the year 
The slowdown  together with the escalating trade war  has prompted economists like Westpac Banking Corp  s Bill Evans to forecast a further two rate cuts by November  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   s Sally Auld to predict another three by mid 2020  taking the cash rate down to 0 5   Lowe suggested in a speech Tuesday night that this wasn t his take 
Asked after the address where he saw the lower bound of the RBA s cash rate  he said   If you look at what happened in the U K   the U S  and Canada  rates got to 0 25 0 5  there  so I think for many economies that s judged to be the effective lower bound  I m not anticipating to get to those levels  ",2019-06-04,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/australias-economy-expands-at-slowest-pace-in-decade-on-housing-1888574,1888574
164969,386485,LOW,RBA Says Further Rate Cut  More Likely Than Not  in Period Ahead,news," Bloomberg     Australia s central bank is likely to lower interest rates again to drive increased hiring and boost households  confidence that inflation will return to target 
The Reserve Bank made the comment in minutes of its June 4 policy meeting  released in Sydney Tuesday  when it eased the cash rate to 1 25   the first reduction in almost three years 
 Given the amount of spare capacity in the labor market and the economy more broadly  members agreed that it was more likely than not that a further easing in monetary policy would be appropriate in the period ahead   policy makers said 
 They also recognized  however  that lower interest rates were not the only policy option available to assist in lowering the rate of unemployment   This line likely referred to RBA chief Philip Lowe s  NYSE LOW  speech following the cut  when he said infrastructure investment and structural reforms could help speed economic growth without the downsides of monetary policy 
The Australian dollar fell after the report  buying 68 41 U S  cents at 11 39 a m  in Sydney  compared with 68 57 cents before its release 
The minutes suggest the central bank is again homing in on inflation  acknowledging it has remained below target for three years and could start to impact household expectations  When he took the helm in 2016  Lowe said RBA officials aren t  inflation nutters  and were focused on boosting financial system resilience through better lending standards and deflating asset prices 
 The inflation target plays an important role as a strong medium term anchor for inflation expectations  to help deliver low and stable inflation  which in turn supports sustainable growth in employment and incomes   the board said 
The central bank again spelled out that the bank s growth  inflation and employment outlook were based on market pricing that rates would be lower in the period ahead 
Debt Dilemma
The board was also confident that the easing wouldn t undo the past three years  work   members judged that a decline in interest rates was unlikely to encourage a material pick up in borrowing by households that would add to medium term risks in the economy   Australia s household debt currently stands at a record high 
Policy makers reiterated that they expected lower rates to stimulate the economy through the exchange rate  cheaper business borrowing costs and reduced mortgage payments for households  freeing up cash for other spending 
Household spending has slowed sharply as house prices tumbled in Sydney and Melbourne  and given this accounts for almost 60  of GDP  is a key sector 
On the international stage  the bank warned of  the intensifying downside risk  posed to the global outlook from the escalation of the U S  China trade dispute 
At home  the central bank said data received for the June quarter and indicators of future activity  had been mixed   It also said employment growth was likely to moderate a little  based on liaison with firms and other forward indicators 
The RBA is now targeting unemployment of 4 5  to try to rekindle inflation  down from the 5  it had previously estimated as full employment ",2019-06-17,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/rba-says-further-rate-cut-more-likely-than-notin-period-ahead-1900104,1900104
164970,386486,LOW,RBA s Lowe Signals Rate Pause While Pledging Readiness to Act,news," Bloomberg     Australia s central bank governor signaled he ll stand pat in coming months to observe the impact of back to back interest rate cuts  while standing ready to resume easing should the outlook at home or abroad take a turn for the worse 
Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe  in an evening speech after taking the cash rate down to 1  earlier Tuesday  cited rising risks to global growth if uncertainty from the U S  China dispute that has stalled investment doesn t end  In Australia  he noted low borrowing costs  high commodity prices  a weaker currency and rising household incomes were cause for optimism 
 We will be closely monitoring how things evolve over coming months   Lowe told community leaders in the northern city of Darwin  according to a text of his speech   Given the circumstances  the board is prepared to adjust interest rates again if needed to get us closer to full employment and achieve the inflation target in a way that supports the collective welfare of all Australians  
Lowe s  NYSE LOW  move to leave the rate door open reflects a need to keep a lid on the currency    given major economies are likely to ease    and an acknowledgment of global volatility generated by the rise of populism and protectionism  Yet he s keeping a hopeful eye on the horizon as stabilizing property markets and rising iron ore prices and mining investment suggest a return of Australia s key economic drivers  houses and holes 
This is part of the reason for his positive view  highlighting in his speech that the central scenario for the Australian economy  is still for reasonable growth  low unemployment and low and stable inflation   At the same time  he highlighted there  is still a fair degree of spare capacity  in the economy and it was possible and desirable to reduce it 
Lowe noted that the exchange rate had depreciated and on a trade weighted basis was at  the bottom end  of its range of recent times   This is helping support important parts of the economy   he said 
The RBA s visit to Darwin comes a little over 51 years after the last board meeting in the city that s closer to Jakarta than Sydney  In June 1968  it was presided over by the bank s first governor  the legendary H C   Nugget  Coombs 
Lowe on Wednesday will travel out to East Arnhem Land to unveil a plaque to Coombs  whose ashes are buried at Yirrkala and the Australian National University in Canberra that he helped found 
Lowe cut rates in June and today  having previously stayed on hold for almost three years since taking the helm  Following Tuesday s cut  futures traders boosted bets the RBA will ease at least once more  though they aren t confident Lowe will move again until November 
Rising concern about the international environment is reflected in manufacturing taking a hit at the end of the second quarter  signaling a worsening economic outlook that could force the world s major central banks into action  Investors are pricing in a Federal Reserve rate cut this month and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   says the European Central Bank will lower its deposit rate by 20 basis points and restart asset purchases in September 
 The uncertainty generated by the trade and technology disputes between the U S  and China has made businesses in many countries nervous about investing   Lowe said 
 Many are preferring to sit on their hands  rather than commit to capital spending that is difficult and costly to reverse   he said   The result is less international trade and a weakening trend in investment globally  If this continues for too much longer  the effects on economic growth are likely to be significant  For this reason  the risks to the global economy remain tilted to the downside  ",2019-07-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/rbas-lowe-signals-rate-pause-while-pledging-readiness-to-act-1913016,1913016

 Today there s very good news for millions of working Australians who will get to keep more of their own money   Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told reporters in Canberra on Thursday  He thanked the four senators for their support of the bill 
Conservative Hero Faces Reality of Australia s Faltering Economy
The cuts will be phased in and by 2024 25  new streamlined brackets will ensure 94  of Australians pay 30  income tax or less  The package includes immediate rebates of as much as A 1 080 for low  and middle income earners  a much needed sugar hit for the faltering economy that will be welcomed by the central bank 
Beyond the tax cuts and previously announced infrastructure spending  the policy agenda for the third term government looks thin  other than tackling red tape and a review industrial relations laws to crack down on union corruption  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe is urging the government to consider stronger action including increased infrastructure investment and structural reforms 
 There are options other than monetary easing for putting us on a better path   Lowe said on Tuesday after the central bank cut interest rates to a record low 1    We will achieve better outcomes for society as a whole if the various arms of public policy are all pointing in the same direction  
Lowe s  NYSE LOW  sense of urgency has been stoked by a litany of data that shows Australia is on track to record its weakest fiscal year since the last recession in 1991  dragged down by record household debt  moribund wages and two years of tumbling housing prices 
The Labor opposition is calling for the government to speed up the cuts instead of waiting until 2022 23  while there are concerns a loss in tax revenue may result in less spending on public services  especially if economic conditions further deteriorate 
The legislation ensures the top income tax rate of 45  kicks in at A 200 000 instead of the current A 180 000  and removes the 32 5  rate  By 2024 25  there will be three brackets 
The Australian Council of Social Service  a group that lobbies for poverty reduction  welcomed the immediate rebate  which will see those earning between A 48 000 and A 90 000 getting A 1 080 of relief 
Still  in a statement earlier this week  it labeled the long term tax cuts as  too expensive  too risky  too unfair  and too late

164992,386508,LOW,Lowe Says RBA Will Consider Case for Lower Rates at June Meeting,news," Bloomberg     Australia s central bank chief said he ll consider cutting interest rates at next month s meeting to spur faster hiring  saying that the jobless rate needs to move below 5  to help drive inflation back to its target 
 A lower cash rate would support employment growth and bring forward the time when inflation is consistent with the target   Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe said in the text of a speech in Brisbane Tuesday   Given this assessment  at our meeting in two weeks  time  we will consider the case for lower interest rates  
The RBA s concession that easier policy is required comes as labor market slack remains and amid persistent evidence that households are reining in spending and slowing the economy  Unemployment climbed to 5 2  in April and inflation in the first three months of this year was tepid  The Australian dollar dropped on Lowe s  NYSE LOW  comments  buying 68 98 U S  cents at 1 13 p m  in Sydney 
 The labor market has surprised on the upside over recent times  and it could do so again   said Lowe   While we can t rule out this possibility  the recent flow of data makes it seem less likely   Still  Lowe said it was possible that current policy settings were sufficient to deliver lower unemployment 
Lowe didn t mention Australia s May 18 election  which led to a surprise victory for Scott Morrison s coalition government  Some economists had said the RBA s decision not to cut on May was to avoid becoming involved in the campaign  Earlier  the central bank published minutes of that meeting 
Over the past three years  household disposable income has increased at an average pace of just 2 75   compared with an average 6  over the preceding decade  The RBA predicts it will accelerate to 4  in the next couple of years  mainly due to government tax relief 
The central bank earlier this month lowered its forecast GDP growth and Lowe acknowledged in his speech that the reduction would ve been deeper if the estimates didn t incorporate market pricing for two rate cuts that would bring the cash rate to a record low 1  
Australia s weakening economy has been reflected in slower global growth  similarly  the contradiction between relatively low unemployment and little inflation is also being played out internationally  suggesting these are worldwide factors 
Overlaying the downturn Down Under has been a tumble in house prices that has eroded household wealth and added to nervousness among consumers  At an international level  there is also the unresolved trade dispute between the U S  and China 
 Over the past year  global trade has not grown at all   Lowe noted   This is unusual as  historically  global trade has tended to increase at least as fast as GDP  This recent weakness partly reflects the slowing in the Chinese economy  but the increases in U S  and Chinese tariffs are also a factor  ",2019-05-20,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/lowe-says-rba-will-consider-case-for-lower-rates-at-june-meeting-1874059,1874059

165014,386530,LOW,Australia Faces Risks as Central Bank Sees Rates on Hold,news," Bloomberg     Australia s economy faces a trifecta of risks that could disrupt household spending and the central bank s outlook for faster economic growth and falling unemployment 
In minutes of its last policy meeting for the year  the Reserve Bank struck a slightly dovish tone  It noted a  generalized tightening of credit availability  in the economy even as it stuck to the script of gradual improvement eventually culminating in an interest rate increase 
 The outlook for household consumption continued to be a source of uncertainty because growth in household income remained low  debt levels were high and housing prices had declined   the RBA said Tuesday in Sydney   Members noted that this combination of factors posed downside risks  
Plunging property prices are beginning to overshadow Governor Philip Lowe s  NYSE LOW  scenario of a sustained expansion that tightens the labor market and gradually lifts inflation  Sydney s market has slumped 10 percent with little end in sight  and banks facing increased scrutiny are shying away from lending  threatening to exacerbate the downturn 
Australia is in the unusual position of solid growth and declining unemployment  amid a record low 1 5 percent cash rate  at a time when property is tumbling in its two biggest cities  The OECD said while housing is on track for a soft landing  it also warned those are exceedingly rare and authorities should prepare for the worst 
The RBA noted that liaison with developers indicated demand for new housing in eastern Australia had eased  and some developers reported that this decline in demand had become more pronounced   It said  demand for off the plan apartments had declined significantly since mid 2017  
This also poses a threat to consumption as fewer people setting up house means less demand for big ticket items like furniture and electronics  hurting already weak retailers 
The RBA met Dec  4  a day before the release of third  quarter GDP that came in weaker than forecast as household spending slowed sharply  That made the bank s optimistic forecasts for a  more than 3 percent  increase in growth and average consumption stand out in the minutes  The economy actually expanded an annual 2 8 percent in the period

165015,386531,LOW,Trump s Tax Cuts Have Boosted Bottom Lines  But Not Much Else,news," Bloomberg     Critics of President Donald Trump s tax law centerpiece    slashing the corporate rate    argued the savings wouldn t spur big companies to expand dramatically  One year later  some key metrics show they were right 
For companies in the Standard   Poor s 500 Index  the profits they ve made from sales this year through September    after accounting for production costs but before paying taxes    have been flat  But  their net profit margins    which include the tax savings    have continued to climb  If they were spending more to hire workers and build U S  factories  those net margins would be lower 
Before the pitchforks come out  put yourself in the shoes of a chief executive officer of a major company  The economy is in the ninth year of an expansion that s already one of the longest in U S  history  and in 2018 you get a big pile of money dropped in your lap  Does expanding make sense when you re already worried about this being the top of the economic cycle 
For the average CEO  it didn t  America s biggest companies instead chose to protect their profits by using their tax savings to offset risings costs  including for labor  transportation and imports caught up in Trump s trade disputes  While they may be politically unpopular after the president and GOP leaders promised their tax law would unleash expansion in the U S   analysts see those moves as prudent 
 They have been criticized for not investing in America  but you don t want them to make unproductive investments at the top of the cycle   said Tim Drayson  head of economics for Legal   General Investment Management  a money manager  The tax overhaul was a  one off boost to earnings  whereas politicians were selling it as transformational  
A slogan like  tax cuts to save the bottom line  wouldn t win over many voters  But that s exactly what corporations did with the billions of dollars they received after the Republican tax law cut the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent  And that helped to push the average net margin for S P 500 firms to its highest level since at least 1990  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
The benefits of the tax cuts  have gone straight to the bottom line  as we had anticipated   Maneesh Deshpande  Barclays Plc s head of U S  equity and global derivatives strategy  said in a research note last month  This came at the expense of spending more on items like capital expenditures and wages  Deshpande said 
The Trump administration continues to defend its tax law and the associated economic benefits  During a call with reporters on Wednesday celebrating the one year anniversary of the overhaul  Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett said capital spending was on track to contribute 1 percent to economic growth this year and survey data shows companies  spending plans over the next six months to a year are  very strong  
S P Decline
Companies have also been spending on buybacks    another way to puff up earnings  S P 500 companies boosted buybacks during the first three quarters of the year by 49 percent to  577 9 billion compared to a year ago  Still  as a percentage of market value  the purchases are in line with previous years 
The overall effect of companies protecting profits and doing buybacks helped to drive the S P 500 to a record high in early September  only for it to sell off amid trade tensions and recession worries  Now the index is headed for its biggest annual decline since the 2008 financial crisis 
Expecting companies to unleash spending just because they got a tax cut isn t how firms operate  despite what they might tout in press releases  They generally invest based on market conditions  not goodwill or national pride  They expand when they see growth coming and pull back when demand wanes  Within the S P 500  cash flows are surging  but a lower percentage of that money is being spent on capital expenditures 
Take General Motors Co  NYSE GM   s response to market realities  The automaker s plan to close U S  factories and cut 14 000 jobs was driven by declining sales of some models and the decision to protect margins by maintaining operations in Mexico s cheaper labor market  The automaker s income tax expense was  366 million in the third quarter on  2 6 billion of profit  which equals a tax rate of 11 9 percent  GM has invested  22 billion in the U S  since 2010  said spokesman Tom Henderson  who declined to provide additional comment 
Companies are also trying to use the tax cuts to gloss over disappointing results  After a weak third quarter  AT T Inc  NYSE T   CEO Randall Stephenson tried to re focus investors away from an unexpected loss of subscribers to big gains in cash flow  which he said would mean more money for shareholder dividends and paying down debt 
 If you look at the cash flows for the quarter  I feel really good about the results   Stephenson said on Oct  24 
What Stephenson might not feel so good about  If AT T s tax rate had remained the same  it would have paid  2 3 billion more in taxes through September of this year  That would have reduced its 20 percent gain in free cash flow to just a 1 percent increase 
Meanwhile  this year AT T has boosted buybacks by 25 percent  and has also said it will spend about  22 billion on capital expenditures  which as a percentage of sales would be lower than each of the past five years  Part of the decline may be the result of acquiring a business that had fewer investment needs  An AT T spokeswoman declined to comment 
 Better to Wait 
At home improvement retailer Lowe s Co s  NYSE LOW    operating margin narrowed by 20 percent this year    but by saving  671 million in taxes  the retailer was able to boost its net margin by 5 percent  At the same time  it canceled capital projects  shuttered weak performing stores and laid off workers    all part of new CEO Marvin Ellison s plan to increase profits after an activist investor pushed out his predecessor for lackluster results 
Still  the retailer said it plans to boost capital spending by about 30 percent next year  A Lowe s spokeswoman declined to comment 
Beyond companies in the S P 500 Index  other surveys show capital expenditures have been disappointing  Nonresidential business investment rose 2 5 percent in the third quarter  the smallest increase since the final three months of 2016  While such spending picked up in early 2018 after plodding along for years  a string of weak reports raises questions about the outlook 
For economist Drayson  this all goes back to the timing of the tax cuts 
 From a pure economy basis  it would have been better to wait until the next downturn before doing this   Drayson said ",2018-12-21,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trumps-tax-cuts-have-boosted-bottom-lines-but-not-much-else-1728622,1728622

165018,386534,LOW,RPM International  RPM  To Post Q1 Earnings  What s Up ,opinion,RPM International Inc    NYSE RPM   is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2020 results on Oct 2  before the opening bell In fiscal fourth quarter 2019  the company s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 8  but revenues missed the same by 0 2   However  RPM International missed the consensus mark in two of the trailing four quarters  with average negative earnings surprise of 6 2  In the last reported quarter  its bottom line increased 21 6  year over year  Net sales also improved 2 8  from a year ago  mainly attributed to strong organic growth of 3 5  and 1 9  contribution of acquisitions to sales growth  Yet  labor and distribution costs  along with the adverse effect of transactional foreign exchange continue to impact its results How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at 91 cents  remaining unchanged over the past 60 days  This indicates an increase of 75  from the year ago reported figure of 52 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  1 49 billion  suggesting a 2 2  year over year improvement Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement RPM International Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Key FactorsThe company is likely to register modest sales growth during the quarter  mainly due to global macroeconomic factors  For the first quarter of fiscal 2020  it anticipates revenues to be up 1 2  year over year Slow construction activities will likely affect sales in North America  the company s largest market  in the quarter to be reported  In addition  weak economic conditions in South America and Europe also added to the woes  Notably  Europe is RPM International s second largest market  Translational foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind in the quarter Nonetheless  focus on strategic acquisitions to drive top line growth and gain market share bodes well  The company s 2020 MAP to Growth operating improvement plan comprising efforts to reduce costs by closing plants  merging IT system  centralizing more of its back office functions and rationalizing its manufacturing footprint is expected to boost margin and the bottom line despite modest top line growth  For the fiscal first quarter  the company also projects 20  adjusted EBIT and EPS improvement each  despite tepid sales growth expectation Importantly  RPM International has realigned the existing reporting structure into four reportable segments   Consumer Group  Specialty Products Group  Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group   to provide greater visibility into the business  Also  from the beginning of the fiscal first quarter  the company will reclassify shipping costs paid to third party shippers from selling  general and administrative expenses into cost of goods sold Meanwhile  increasing costs for distribution and labor have been a major concern for RPM International  which shares space with Nippon Paint Holdings Co   Ltd   in Zacks  industry  That said  the company has been aggressively pursuing price increases to offset the increasing costs and protect gross profit margins  This is likely to contribute to bottom line growth  In a nutshell  the company s multi year restructuring plan   the 2020 Margin Acceleration Plan   2020 MAP to Growth     will help it maintain a balance between its segments  performance and drive growth What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not suggest that RPM International is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be

165106,386622,LOW,Exclusive  Ackman makes fresh layoffs at Pershing Square hedge fund,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman  whose investment assets have shrunk by more than half in the last three years  has made a second round of staff cuts and laid off three investor relations team members  two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday 
The prominent manager cut one investor relations executive and two investor services executives at his New York based Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management hedge fund last week  the sources said  These layoffs come after Ackman cut his staff by 10 people in January  shrinking the firm to 46 employees from 56 
A spokesman for the firm declined to comment 
The fresh round of layoffs shows that Ackman  one of the industry s most voluble activist investors  is moving forward with an overhaul that some had questioned but has so far been successful  involving both cost cuts and investment strategy changes 
Pershing Square now oversees roughly  8 billion in assets  less than half the amount it managed at its peak in 2015  Assets dwindled after three years of losses which prompted many investors to ask for some of their money back 
Unlike other managers who might try to replace departing capital  Ackman decided to re tool his firm  telling clients that he wants to return to his roots by running a smaller firm and growing assets only through improved returns not by bringing in new investors 
In addition to the layoffs  key members of his team have voluntarily left 
Investment team member Ali Namvar retired and Vice Chairman Steve Fraidin returned to practicing law as a partner at Cadwalader  Wickersham   Taft 
Investment team member Brian Welch is leaving at the end of this month  The investment team has historically had between eight and 10 members 
In his early years  Ackman dazzled with double digit returns  often delivering some of the industry s best returns 
As part of the revamp  Ackman  one of the industry s most visible managers  said he would stay out of the limelight to concentrate on investments  leaving the visiting with clients to others  So far this year the firm has made bets on  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX  and Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  
So far Ackman s promises of delivering improved returns appear to be materializing  Through the middle of June  Pershing Square s private hedge fund was up more than 9 percent while the publicly traded fund  Pershing Square Holdings Ltd  was up 11 4 percent since the start of the year ",2018-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-ackman-makes-fresh-layoffs-at-pershing-square-hedge-fund-1508526,1508526
165107,386623,LOW,Aussie At 2 Week Low On RBA Comments,opinion,"RBA s Lowe Prepared To Ease Further
In a speech titled  Inflation Targeting and Economic Welfare  late this morning  RBA Governor Lowe said that he would be willing to ease policy further if needed  adding that no rate hike would be considered until inflation is within the intended target range  which could be some time  He said it was reasonable to expect an  extended period  of low rates 
AUD USD slid to the lowest level in two weeks after the comments  while AUD JPY hit the lowest since July 11  AUD USD is approaching the 55 day moving average at 0 6957 

Equities Continue Higher
Asia carried on where America left off yesterday by pushing US indices either to  or close to  record levels  Wall Street indices rose between 0 11  and 0 15  with the SPX500 index climbing to within a whisker of a new record high  China shares gained 0 58  and even Hong Kong shares managed a 0 14  advance 
Currency markets were more mixed  with the Euro still feeling downward pressure ahead of the ECB rate meeting later today  EUR USD fell 0 04  to 1 1134 and is approaching the April May lows of 1 1111 and 1 1107  respectively  AUD USD slid 0 14  to 0 6967 after Lowe s  NYSE LOW  comments  see below  while GBP USD slid 0 09  to 1 2472 

Will They Or Won t They 
The major event today is undoubtedly the ECB rate meeting  with most believing the statement and subsequent press conference will contain a dovish bias  The only uncertainty is whether the Bank will actually trim rates today or at the September meeting  According to Bloomberg calculations  market pricing implies a 39  probability of a 10bps cut today which  while not high enough to almost guarantee a cut  is still relatively high  Looking at the September meeting  the odds jump to 62  for a 10bps cut  Bear in mind that Draghi leaves his office at the end of October 
With market positioning invariably bearish ahead of the meeting  there could be a growing tail risk that the level of dovishness displayed by Mr  Draghi and company may not meet these expectations and a sharp reversal of pricing in bond and FX markets could follow  That s a risk worth taking note of 
German Sentiment Surveys On Tap
Aside from the ECB meeting  Germany has the IFO surveys for July to focus on  The expectations index is seen falling to 94 0 from 94 2  the current assessment index to 100 4 from 100 8 and the business climate index is expected to fall to 97 1 from 97 4  Given the weak performance by the flash PMIs yesterday  the downside for all these readings could be vulnerable 
On the US front  durable goods orders for June are seen rebounding to  0 7  from  1 3  the previous month  while the good trade deficit for the same month is expected to improve to   72 4 billion from   75 1 billion

165108,386624,LOW,Earnings Preview  Lowe s  LOW  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Lowe s  LOW  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 9  
Revenues are expected to be  21 01 billion  up 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lowe s 
For Lowe s  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lowe s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lowe s would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 22  delivering a surprise of  8 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lowe s doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-lowes-low-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200455060,200455060

Potential outcomes  
Base case  A  25 bps cut with a nod to at least one further cut  possibly in Lowe s  NYSE LOW  evening speech  
Dovish case  Any suggestions that easing above and beyond the previous assumed  50 bps of cuts needs to be implemented to support the labour market and or GDP growth 
Hawkish Case  A  wait and see  approach on the back of the assumed cut to see how the outlined macro measures feed through into housing and consumer spending

Last week saw the USD index come under pressure as the Trade war remained the focal point  This week s events do not change anything   President Trump is visiting the U K and other events ranging from non farm payroll  NFP   ISM releases and Fed Chair Powell speaking Tuesday are expected to influence direction  Also making it a tad more difficult for FX traders is the yield in the U S 10 years reaching two year lows and encroaching on the  2 05  handle 
EUR USD   1 1176  trades within striking distance of the psychological  1 12 now that  1 11 handle held twice in the past fortnight  With BTP s and Bund futures trade higher today as the markets continue their  risk off  theme started a few weeks back  The  single  unit is expected to remain quiet this week  at least until we will see the ECB rate decision on Thursday  07 45 am ET  with focus on the staff projections and any details on TLTRO 3 
GBP USD   1 2640  trades above the  1 26 handle after briefly trading below last week  The U K is hosting Trump for a three day state visit and he is expected to meet with Boris Johnson  a favorite for the PM position  The pound was unmoved from this morning s disappointing U K PMI manufacturing data  which went into contraction for the first time since the Jun 2016 Brexit Referendum  The Bank of England s  BoE  Governor Carney is scheduled to speak Thursday  which could see some market moving comments 

5  UK Manufacturing PMI signals contraction 
Data this morning showed that the U K manufacturing sector showed increased signs of renewed contraction last month 
At 49 4  down sharply from 53 1 in April  the headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit PMI fell below the neutral 50 0 benchmark for the first time in three years 
Digging deeper  manufacturers reported increased difficulties in convincing clients to commit to new contracts which mainly reflected the already high level of inventories following recent stockpiling activity in advance of the original Brexit date 
The total volume of new business placed fell for the first time in seven months  while the rate of contraction was the greatest and fastest in a number of years  New order inflows deteriorated from both domestic and overseas sources  while new export business fell for the second month running and at the quickest pace in nearly five years   manufacturers reported a lower demand from Asia and Europe 
There was also mention of Brexit uncertainty  including clients diverting supply chains away from the U K  leading to lower demand from within the E U

It was a mild risk on opening in FX with commodity dollars dominating the leaderboard as the surprising center right win in Australia helped rally the markets and gap Aussie higher on Monday open 
AUD USD rose to a high of  6928 in the wake of the win by the Liberal party which not only upset the front running Labor but was able to eke out a razor thin majority in Parliament negating the need to share coalition power with smaller parties  The news brought some much needed cheer to Aussie bulls which have been under almost relentless assault for the past week as the pair slipped first below the  7000 mark and then under  6900 
The grossly oversold cross saw some short covering at the open and could squeeze higher to the key  7000 figure if risk flows remain supportive this week  All eyes will now turn to RBA Governor Lowe s  NYSE LOW  speech on Wednesday with traders keen to see just how dovish he will be  The market has already priced in 50bp worth of rate cuts by the end of the year  but the RBA has been reluctant to commit to any easing so far despite the clear threats to the economy from the Sino US trade rupture  Indeed even if Governor Lowe does hint at a rate cut in June he may assert a  one and done  posture of RBNZ which would be viewed as positive by the market 
While politics were having a positive impact on Australia  the story in Europe could be much more problematic  The upcoming European elections suggest that right wing anti EU populist parties may score large gains this week  which would make consensus governing even more difficult to achieve as the main aim of these parties is to create an economic crisis within the region to force a break up of the union  The euro therefore remains under increasing selling pressure and a combination of populist gains along with a weak rebound in flash PMI data later in the week could send the pair through the 1 1100 support and open the way for a run on the key 1 1000 level as the week proceeds 
For now  the markets remain in contained ranges but given the wide array of event risk this week  the quiet is not likely to last ",2019-05-20,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-aussie-could-go-higher-and-euro-lower-this-week-200422937,200422937

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Tecnoglass is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Lowe s has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TGLS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
TGLS currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 86  while LOW has a forward P E of 16 81  We also note that TGLS has a PEG ratio of 0 54  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  LOW currently has a PEG ratio of 1 18 
Another notable valuation metric for TGLS is its P B ratio of 2 17  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  LOW has a P B of 22 45 
Based on these metrics and many more  TGLS holds a Value grade of A  while LOW has a Value grade of C

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lowe s 
For Lowe s  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 19  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lowe s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lowe s would post earnings of  0 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

165255,386771,LOW,U S  new home sales hit seven month low as prices soar,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    New U S  single family home sales unexpectedly fell in July  dropping to their lowest in seven months amid a surge in prices  raising concerns of a slowdown in the housing market recovery 
Coming on the heels of data this month showing a tumble in home building and permits in July  the weak sales pace suggests that housing could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter 
 The third quarter sales data are starting out significantly below the second quarter average  and many other housing reports have also shown some recent weakening in their respective trends   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York   Today s report strengthens our conviction that real residential investment will decline in the third quarter  
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales declined 9 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 571 000 units last month  the lowest level since December 2016  The percentage drop was the largest since August 2016 and confounded economists  expectations for a 0 3 percent gain 
June s sales pace was revised up to 630 000 units from the previously reported 610 000 units  Home sales in May also were not as weak as previously reported  taking some of the sting from July s report 
New home sales  which account for 9 4 percent of overall housing sales  are volatile month to month and are drawn from building permits  Still  sales declined 8 9 percent on a year on year basis  the first annual drop since February 2016 
July s sales pace was below the second quarter average of 613 000 units  Sales fell in the Northeast  South and West  but rose in the Midwest  In a separate report on Wednesday  the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy a house decreased last week to a six month low 
A survey last month by Fannie Mae  the largest U S  mortgage guarantor  showed a drop in the share of respondents saying now is a good time to buy a home as well as a surge in the number of those who believe this is a bad time to buy 
Housing subtracted nearly three tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the second quarter 
SUPPLY SQUEEZE
U S  financial markets were little moved by the data as investors worried over comments by President Donald Trump threatening a government shutdown to secure funding for a border wall with Mexico  raising the specter of a tough budget battle 
Trump also said late on Tuesday he might terminate the NAFTA trade treaty with Mexico and Canada after three way talks failed to bridge deep differences 
The PHLX index of housing stocks  HGX  fell in line with a broadly weaker U S  stock market  Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton  N DHI   slipped 0 22 percent and  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  fell 0 28 percent 
Pultegroup  N PHM  stock declined 0 43 percent  The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  Treasuries rose 
Despite the drop in new home sales  the housing market remains underpinned by a strong labor market  which is near full employment  But it is being hampered by a shortage of homes  which is driving up prices 
Contributing to the dearth of homes on the market  some homeowners are remodeling their houses rather than trading up 
Those renovations are boosting business for home improvement retailers like Lowe s Companies  N LOW   which on Wednesday reported a 6 8 percent increase in net sales in the quarter ended Aug  4 
The median price of a new home increased 6 3 percent in July from a year ago to  313 700  In contrast  annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2 5 percent 
Despite the acute housing shortage  builders are struggling to fill the void  citing supply constraints  including labor  land and finance  Last month  70 percent of the new single family homes sold were either yet to be built or under construction in July 
 New home sales are still concentrated in the higher end of the market   said Matthew Pointon  an economist at Capital Economics in New York   Until builders switch their efforts to cheaper starter homes that will limit to degree to which sales can grow  
The inventory of new homes on the market rose 1 5 percent to 276 000 units last month  the highest level since June 2009  Still  new housing stock is less than half of what it was at its zenith during the housing bubble 
At July s sales pace it would take 5 8 months to clear the

Another central banker has  blinked   with RBA Governor Lowe shifting to a neutral stance joining the Federal Reserve and ECB 
We can expect more of the same from the Bank of England  BOE  this evening  Governor Carney has been quite vocally Brexit s Angel of Death and an uber dove for quite some time  but with central banks globally shifting policy stance tonight s BOE rate decision and Mr Carney s missives could have a real impact on Sterling 
Globally  central banks are in a much more unfavourable position to provide the sugar rush that markets have become addicted to since the global financial crisis  GFC   The ECB  BOE  RBNZ and RBA are all still at record low levels of interest rates and the Fed s headlong rush to unwind quantitative easing and hike rates  to put some easing bullets in the gun for a rainy day  appears to have been cut short 
A global downturn  should it occur this year  means the central banks won t be able to steal future growth to keep the lights on today  their go to strategy since the GFC  It s no wonder the millennials of today are so angry 
Climbing down off my soapbox  markets consolidated overnight in the U S  with the USD outperforming following weak data from Germany  Singapore is back from holiday today  but China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and South Korea continue their Lunar New Year  implying that trading will continue its muted theme in Asia 
That said  there have been fireworks in AUD and NZD today which should remain the centre of attention for the session 
FX
Both AUD and Kiwi have been taken out back and shot overnight  The AUD collapsed 1 60  to 0 7105 on Lowe s  NYSE LOW  dovish stance and concerns about the global economy along with wilting house prices 
AUD is a high beta currency to world trade and China  With another impending shutdown in the U S  and U S  China trade talks resuming next week  the lucky country will be looking anything but in the short term  Traders will be nervously eyeing crucial support at 0 7070 with nothing but a black hole on the charts after that 
The NZD collapsed by 1 70  to 0 6770 this morning on weak employment data  Slowing jobs growth and a high beta to China as well means the charmed run of the Goldilocks economy may be over for now  Support lies at 0 6705 after which the technical picture looks ominous

With ridiculously overpriced housing markets  combined with high levels of consumer debt  Australia and New Zealand are my leading candidates for a significant asset price shakeout following ten years of easing by central banks since the GFC  They won t be the last 
Stocks
Not a lot to say here overnight with markets consolidating their recent gains as the State of the Union passed without incident  The Lunar New Year holidays will ensure that trading remains subdued in Asian markets  with the attention on Australia and New Zealand  Traders will be looking to see if the FX ructions overflow onto stock markets there 
Gold
Gold fell to USD 1 305 overnight as the greenback strengthened across the board  The geopolitical scene is going quiet  for now  which has seen one of gold s support pillars erode as profit taking has set in  The situation is unlikely to stay calm though  and support in the 1300 00 region looks secure for now 
Oil
Oil sold initially on a stronger dollar  But both WTI and Brent rallied to finish slightly higher at  53 80 and  62 60 a barrel  Lower than expected crude inventory number along with high OPEC production cut compliance rescued the black gold  and oil overall continues to consolidate at these levels

Will BoE join the central banks  insisting that the uncertainty gets them to wait and see  or to ease monetary policy  If it sounds so  the pound may draw down to  1 28  This idea is suggested by Toronto Dominion Bank  and it can be hardly argued  We all saw what the impact of Jerome Powell s dovish rhetoric  Mario Draghi s hints at LTRO and Philip Lowe s  NYSE LOW  hints at the cash rate cut was on the US dollar  the euro and the Aussie  The Sterling can well follow their examples  especially since investors are exiting the GBP longs now 
Investors have at last seen that the extension of the Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union  TEU  doesn t ease the uncertainty  but extends its further  Even a rise in average wages growth won t allow the BoE to hike its Bank rate  With this regard  a delay in the start of monetary normalization to a later period than it was expected before looks rather reasonable  The derivatives market expects that the Bank of England is 70  likely to start monetary restriction in March  2020 Probability of BoE interest rate changesSource  Bloomberg
In general  the current fall of the GBP USD looks more reasonable than the pair growth in January  Investors have realized that they were too optimistic about the improvement of political environment  It has remained the same  Another Theresa May s bargaining trip to Brussels to seek further concessions is about to fail  The EU doesn t understand why the UK should get a better place in the hell  The talks that the UK government discusses the extension of Article 50 of EU Treaty or that the Parliament won t allow messy Brexit don t encourage the pound fans any longer  In addition  the BoE may join the club  led by the Fed as usually 
The BoE job has never been easy  IN 2016  after the vote on the UK membership in the EU  it cut the interest rate  Some used to call it a rash decision  as it resulted in the inflation growth  Now  there are more and more talks about the regulator s perfect measures  Inflation was curved  and the increased uncertainty made ease its monetary policy  At present  the BoE may scare the financial markets off by its reference to higher political risks  On the other hand  it if doesn t do so  it is going to lose the face in future  in case the economic situation in the UK gets worse  Mark Carney must be extremely cautious  a single wrong word may result in GBP USD sharp movements 
However  the UK strong labour market  steady wages growth  a leading indicator over inflation  and the confidence that policy makers won t let messy Brexit may cause a split in MPC  If a few Committee members vote for the interest rate hike  the GBP USD rate will be back above 1 3  Otherwise  if Mark Carney sounds dovish  the pound will be falling deeper ",2019-02-07,LiteForex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gbpusd-pound-will-take-a-special-place-in-hell-200384871,200384871

The stable housing market  increasing house prices and quite a high level of consumer confidence are good tailwinds for the business  Despite a little slowdown in U S  existing home sales in 2018  now the situation is stabilizing  by the way  it is far higher than its long term averages 
U S  Existing Home Sales data by YCharts
Company Overview
The company is the second largest home improvement retailer in the world with  69 billion annual sales  The huge scale of the company gives the firem great purchasing power  due to which the company suggests low prices and creates a considerable economic moat for the business The new CEO Marvin Elison is triggering structural changes in the company  Emphasizing the importance of supply chain improvements and the usage of new technology  the management is going to spend  1 6 billion in capital expenditures in 2019  They are going to improve the quality of the labor management and inventory control which would undeniably cut spendings and improve profitability ratios 
Competitive Advantages
The company s scale gives the firm a great bargaining power with suppliers when it comes to products and advertisement  The company s strategy has helped it deliver average adjusted returns on invested capital of 16  over the past five years  at the same time the management s long term goal for ROIC is 35  which is quite realistic considering that in 2009 the ROIC was just 9 36  and in 2018 it was 17 04 
The developed distribution network is one of the firm s competitive advantages  The company s supply chain connects 80  of the firm s merchandise through one of 15 regional distribution centers  The management invests heavily on expanding the supply chain  the bulk distribution network will expand to more than 20 locations from 11 in 2018  and cross dock delivery terminals will be 90 from 5 currently 
The firm intends to capture 12  long term operating margin  We need to notice that the trend favors the projection as the company was able to increase the margin steadily in the last 10 year period  from 6 9  in 2010 to 9 6  in 2018  
First of all  we compare the stock price with the analyst s consensus price target  We notice here that in the last 5 year period the stock was mainly undervalued compared to analyst s estimates  and now it stands 15  lower than the average price target 

LOW data by YChartsDCF
Valuation
Lowe s was able to generate 3 97  CAGR of revenue in the last 10 year period  At the same time in 2018  the firm generated a 4  sales growth rate with same store sales growth of 2 5  and moderate location growth  netting 10 boxes per year   If we consider the above mentioned tailwinds and growth rate in past years  the 3  revenue growth rate will be quite a controversial projection for the future 10 years 
The operating margin was steadily increasing in the past years reaching 9 6  level  Considering management s cost cutting strategy and investments in the development of the supply chain we think that the margins could continue their upward movement  The management s long term operating margin target is 12   Despite the fact that we consider the target quite realistic  in our model  we will use 9 6  10  territory considering that the margin will slowly expand to 10

Our final model is here  We have  115 intrinsic value which exceeds current market price by 21   We need to notice that we recorded about 20  undervaluation when we adopted a pretty controversial approach  with only 3  revenue growth and no more than 10  operating margin

At the same time  the Company has a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off market transactions  On January 26  2018  the Company s Board of Directors authorized a  5 0 billion share repurchase program with no expiration  which was announced on the same day  As of November 2  2018  the Company had  4 5 billion remaining in its share repurchase program 
It means that the outstanding stock quantity is rapidly shrinking  If they buy the stocks at current market price  it would mean that 5 5  of total shares outstanding would go out from the market increasing the EPS and stock prices 
ConclusionThe company looks attractively valued in the current market condition  the macroenvironment and management s efforts to improve the company s efficiency provide great tailwinds for the firm  Our price target of  115 approximately coincides with analysts  consensus price target ",2019-01-28,Narek Zakaryan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lowes-stock-valuation-200379902,200379902

165311,386827,LOW,AUD Selling  RBA Lowe s Comments Suprise Traders,opinion,"It s all AUD selling today  although we ve seen good interest to be long the ASX 200  AUS200  as well  RBA governor Lowe caught traders off guard  and his comments  at 12 30 aedt  saw the floor give way  with Aussie 3 year bond yields falling a sizeable 8 basis points  causing AUD USD to drop off 80 pips or so into 0 7159  with AUD JPY having the big move on the day  with a 1 2  sell off 

Dr  Lowe has given his view that the bank has moved to a formal neutral policy setting  which should be seen in writing in this Friday s SoMP  Granted  the governor hasn t moved to an explicit easing bias and said that he doesn t see a strong case for a near term rate cut  That s fine  but the market doesn t expect a near term rate cut either  but  they do see a move by 2020  and they see the risk of a cut by December at 54  
The ASX 200 has attracted buyers from the unwind of the auction and found another leg higher on Lowe s  NYSE LOW  comments  with a touch of rotation out of financials and into industrial and material names  The message seems fairly clear   avoid the banks and stocks which are a solid proxy of the domestic economy  and now we have clarity of the regulatory environment  the investment case to own the banks is premised on your view on how the Aussie economy looks in six   12  and 24 months 
If you take the view that we are headed towards a recession type environment  and bad and doubtful debts are to rise  then it leads in strongly into the key question  That being  whether the bank s dividends sustainable  At this juncture  analysts feel dividends are sustainable  with the consensus calling for CBA  if we take this bank as an example  to pay a  4 32 dividend this year   4 37 in 2020 and  4 43 in 2021  The moment traders see cashflow under threat  and a real risk to dividends then watch short interest ramp up 
CBAs 1H19 earnings numbers today were uninspiring  especially after the recent rally  Granted  the stock trades on 14 3x 12 month earnings  and an undemanding P BV  so there was some cushion from valuation  but cash earnings were around 0 5  below the street  while revenues were soft  Asset quality was fine  at 15bp of total loans   but again  this is a story about asset quality in the future should the economic momentum continue in its current fashion  The fact their capital ratios were better than what was expected should provide an additional buffer should a real downturn play out  Expenses were handled well and again this will play a role in delivering the  5 40 EPS for FY2019 
Economic divergence
If we look at the Citigroup  NYSE C  Economic Surprise Indices  which looks at economic data relative to expectations 
Orange   AustraliaWhite   US Blue   EuropeGrey   UK

It feels as though we are seeing signs of economic divergence again  with data in the US generally improving through January  Ok  so if we look at survey s  such as the month NFIB small business survey we can see it s not all rosy  but on the whole  we can see an increasing divergence in market sensitive data points  such as the manufacturing PMI series 

European data has been consistently weak  with Italy now in a technical recession  while Aussie data has started to roll over relative to forecasts  This is a trend we need to watch because if US data starts to stabilise and other economic data points show further vulnerabilities  we should almost see a re run of 2018 when the USD strengthened and global capital made its way into US assets 
Equity bulls in control for now
Nothing has really changed from the note I put out yesterday and the S P 500  NASDAQ and Dow continue to grind higher  I have focused on 2815 as the near term target  in the S P 500   and tactically it feels as though the price will meet a wall of supply into here 
So much discussion has taken hold on the floors around liquidity dynamics  with much focus placed on moves in the global M2 money supply  As we can see in the Bloomberg chart  the global M2 money supply has had a solid move higher for some months now  and this may have supported global equity markets  the yellow line is the MSCI world index  

Regular readers of The Daily Fix will have seen the below chart before  and its one that I focus on closely  Here  we can see the influence changes in US excess reserves held with Fed banks  the green line  have on the USD index  USDX on MT5   Take a view on excess reserves  take a view on the USD 

One interesting correlation that has broken down recently  for reasons more specific to supply  with Vale declaring force majeure on certain contracts  is iron ore futures  orange  vs EUR USD three month volatility  Correlation vs causation  but I feel EUR USD volatility is just too cheap and ready to head higher 

To put this in perspective  the implied move over the coming three months is 288 pips  which considering the time premium involved is just too low  Something doesn t sit right with this  especially with the 7 March ECB meeting potentially being a vol event in itself  The daily chart of EUR USD shows the pair commanding a 1 13 or 1 14 handle  at one stage on an intra day basis  for a joint record 58 trading sessions  and it feels as though once it pulls away from one of these levels  then a strong trend should be formed  I see risks of a move into  1 1330 and the low Bollinger band  
I am also watching GBP USD here  as we see implied volatility creep up and traders are paying up for put vols over calls  Tomorrow  Theresa May meets Juncker and Tusk to discuss the Irish backstop  which will end the way it always does  with no signs of a resolution and we head ever closer to the critical deadlines  Cable is holding the September downtrend  but momentum is headed lower  and a break of trend support should be respected  GBP bulls need price to bounce here  or the risk of a move into 1 2930 is likely ",2019-02-06,Chris Weston,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-lowe-blow-for-the-aud-200384140,200384140

165363,386879,LOW,Hanjin s fall will not fix the global shipping industry s ills,news,"By Nick Carey CHICAGO  Reuters    Following the collapse of Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd  KS 117930   container shipping rates from Asia to the United States spiked 50 percent as the carrier s customers scrambled for ships  Few shipping industry experts expect those price increases to fix what is wrong with the industry  Hanjin s collapse and the resulting chaos in the global shipping sector are symptoms of deeper ills caused by a capacity glut that will remain even after the resolution of Hanjin s crisis  industry officials and experts told Reuters   All of Hanjin s ships aren t just going to sink overnight   said Clint Eisenhauer  vice president for external affairs at the South Carolina Port Authority   We are going to see the same imbalance between supply and demand  and beyond a short term spike the impact on rates shouldn t be dramatic    In recent years container ship companies have gone on a spending spree  ordering ever larger vessels based on the assumption of rising trade in consumer goods from China and Asia   Shipping industry data provider Alphaliner estimates fleet owners will increase container shipping capacity by 3 9 percent in 2016  even as estimates for global demand range from growth of just 1 percent to 3 percent  According to order book figures from British shipping services firm Clarkson  the global container ship fleet should grow by 16 9 percent between now and 2019    These are significant investments that were based on what seemed reasonable forecasts at the time   said Dean Tracy  principal of consultancy Global Integrated Services and former import transportation director at Lowe s  N LOW   However  exports of goods and services as a percentage of global gross domestic product have slipped in recent years to 29 3 percent in 2015 from 30 7 percent in 2012  according to data compiled by the World Bank   The mismatch between supply and demand has left 7 4 percent of container ships worldwide sitting idle as of this spring  according to Alphaliner  Consulting firm Drewry said in July it expects a record 150 container vessels would be scrapped this year  but that would  only make a dent  in the excess capacity built between 2010 and 2015  The capacity overhang has battered container shipping rates and shipping company profits  In mid February 2015  it cost  2 265 to haul a container from Shanghai to the U S  West Coast  By late August  the price for shipping a container across the Pacific had fallen by nearly half to  1 153  Rates rose to  1 746 in early September  according to the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index  but remain well short of the earlier peak  All the major companies have struggled amid a low rate environment  Maersk  CO MAERSKb   the world s largest container ship company  has warned investors its 2016 profit will be significantly lower than last year  fired its chief executive and announced plans to restructure its business  Germany s Hapag Lloyd  DE HLAG  also warned profits would fall this year  South Korea s  Hyundai Merchant Marine  Co Ltd  KS 011200   the world s fourteenth largest carrier  avoided collapse earlier this year when it managed to cut a deal with creditors    I think the container sector has more serious long term structural problems   said Ralph Leszczynski  head of research at shipbroker Banchero Costa in Singapore    A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE INDUSTRY  The bankruptcy of Hanjin is the largest ever collapse of a container ship company  The world s seventh biggest carrier has a fleet of 88 ships or around 3 percent of global capacity  Hanjin only owns around 30 of those vessels and runs the rest on charters   Two questions now are how much of Hanjin s capacity will be scrapped  which could help firm up shipping rates  and how much will be replaced by rivals seeking to grab market share    Seaspan Corp   N SSW  Chief Executive Gerry Wang says he has already been approached by a number of other operators who want to lease three ships his company  the largest global lessor of container ships  had placed with Hanjin under long term contracts  Wang said Hanjin s woes could boost container shipping rates as some of the carrier s older ships should be idled   It has been a fiasco  but this could be a positive development for the industry   he said   I think we are going to see a shift to stronger  more stable carriers   he added   FLIGHT TO QUALITY  Rival shippers are moving to fill the breach created by Hanjin  Within days of Hanjin s bankruptcy filing  Maersk  CO MAERSKb  and Mediterranean Shipping Company SA  the world s two largest carriers who have a vessel sharing agreement  announced they would both launch new trans Pacific services on Sept  15  Both companies committed six ships each to the new services   The moves are  symptomatic of the industry s oversupply problems   said Chaim Shacham  a consultant and former maritime shipping executive based in New Jersey  In an email  Soren Egholm  vice president of trade and marketing at Maersk Line North America  said that as a  financially strong company we are currently being approached by many customers on the Transpacific who ask if we can provide alternative transport solutions for their cargo    Lawrence Gross  a partner at FTR Transportation Intelligence  said that Hanjin s collapse could push producers and retailers to more closely scrutinize the shipping companies they choose   
 Customers have treated container shipping as a pure commodity play  but now they realize not all carriers are built the same   Gross said   I think we may see a bit of a flight to quality as customers seek more stable partners  ",2016-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hanjin's-fall-will-not-fix-the-global-shipping-industry's-ills-425681,425681

165390,386906,LOW,Earnings Preview  Lowe s  LOW  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Lowe s  LOW  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 99 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 7  
Revenues are expected to be  17 32 billion  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 72  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lowe s 
For Lowe s  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 11  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lowe s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lowe s would post earnings of  2 02 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 07  delivering a surprise of  2 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lowe s doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-lowes-low-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200358763,200358763

165474,386990,LOW,Is Lowe s Companies  LOW  Stock A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lowe s Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Lowe s Companies  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lowe s Companies has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lowe s Companies stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lowe s Companies has a P S ratio of about 1 0  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years As we can see  the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lowe s Companies currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lowe s Companies a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Lowe s Companies is just 0 9  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 3  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  LOW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lowe s Companies might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F  This gives LOW a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current fiscal quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to only one lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen twelve upward and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 7 4  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 4 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lowe s Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus    The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Lowe s Companies is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineLowe s Companies is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 42   should boost investor confidence However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has slightly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Lowe s Companies The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty

165639,387155,LOW,Week Ahead  S P 500 Extends Losses  Oil Awaits Inventory Numbers,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
The Week That Was
Uncertainty is the Name of the Game
US Fiscal Policy
Last week was dominated by politics  from the attempt to recuperate from the North Korea tensions  Charlottesville  and terror in Europe 
The S P 500 extended a second week of losses at 2 07 percent  its worst two day fall since February 2016  It appears that even after seven months of no cohesive agenda  investors are still holding onto to the notion of reflation under President Donald Trump  The market narrative attributes most of last week s losses to a reduced likelihood of Trump executing his agenda after receiving backlash to his Charlottesville moral equivalency statement 
Monetary Policy
The FOMC minutes from the July meeting revealed key topics among the policy makers  is the inflation impotency temporary or a long term problem  and what are the implications for the interest rate path  The end result is that the Fed raised rates twice this year  with a possible third on the way  That doesn t change the economic trajectory 
Investors are keenly aware that any uncertainty expressed by the Fed will compound political hesitation 
Broad Base Expansion In The EU  But Monetary Policy Uncertain
While economic data has been strengthening in Europe  confirming repeated reports of the non US market s advantages economically  politically and from a valuation perspective ambiguity across the EU is creating significant potential for market volatility 
The European growth rate is catching up with the US at almost 2 5 percent  Germany was not the only country pushing Europe s growth  rather  it was joined by the Netherlands and even Italy after recovering from the verge of a banking crisis  This broad base expansion provides a more reliable trajectory of further expansion for the Eurozone 
The downside to the region s biggest expansion since the Great Recession is the rising euro  First  it makes exports less competitive  which may hurt European companies  Second  the ECB minutes revealed the European policymakers are wrestling with the same question  how would the rising EUR impact the ECB path of interest rate hikes

Last week s political turmoil further distances Trump s business agenda  and the S P 500 closed beneath the 50 dma  green  and its uptrend line since December 20  2016 The 100 dma  blue   currently at 2417 1254  is the bulls  next line of defense  Should the price close beneath that  its trajectory would be the next uptrend line  since February 11  2016  aiming at 2400 00  Note how the 200 dma  red  follows the angle of the longer term uptrend line  signifying its meaningfulness

The DAX has been trading in a short term falling trend since June 20  On August 11  it bounced off the uptrend line since June 24  2016  the day the Brexit vote results were revealed  The significance of this uptrend line is confirmed by the 200 dma  red  that is retracing it 
However  although the price found support it stopped short of overcoming the short term downtrend line and has since turned back down  A further bearish indication was the dead cross execution  when the 50 dma  green  crossed below the 100 dma  blue  on Friday 
The price is fluctuating  and is looking for an opening for the price to move into  either the short term downtrend line   with a break above 12400 00   or longer term uptrend line   with a break below 11800 00

165683,387199,LOW,Does Lowe s  LOW  Make For A Suitable Value Investment ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lowe s has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 09  This level compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 29 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock  the current level puts Lowe s current PE among its lows over the past five years  This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its own historical levels and thus it could prove to be a suitable entry point from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Building Products   Retail industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lowe s has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 09  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lowe s stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lowe s has a P S ratio of about 1 02  This is lower than the Zacks categorized Building Products   Retail industry average  which comes in at 1 31 right now LOW is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lowe s currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lowe s a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Lowe s is just 1 16  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 46  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 98  which is far better than the industry average of 16 38  Clearly  LOW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lowe s might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives LOW a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  Lowe s seems to have pretty striking prospects However  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and eight downward revisions in the same time period This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant  while the full year estimate has inched slightly lower  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lowe s Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLowe s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front Also  notably  the Building Products   Retail industry has clearly outperformed the broader market over the last two yeas  as you can see below Nevertheless  although boasting of a strong industry rank  Top 38  out of more than 250 industries   the company s Zacks Rank  3 somewhat dims the sparkle  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the

165795,387311,LOW,Markets Priced For Perfection Rarely Get What They  Price In ,opinion,"It is almost inconceivable  Just 10 years ago  you could purchase a 3 year Treasury and sock away a risk free rate of return of nearly 6   Right now  A paltry 1 5  
It follows that  today  one must take enormous chances to generate an income stream up and above the pace of inflation  And that s only if you believe inflation gauges placing the annual rate in the neighborhood of 2  
For example  let s assume an individual purchases a 5 year Treasury for its risk free 2  yield  The year over year income might maintain the individual s purchasing power  if the person s basket does not involve things like medication  health care  education  child care or rent  Worse yet  if the individual s portfolio is much like the 5 year Treasury itself  the portfolio s real rate of return would be 0  
What if the investor wants a real return far greater than 0   Well  then  he she would need to take significant chances with money in riskier assets  Stocks  high yield bonds  REITs  MLPs  Indeed  the pursuit of modest reward would come with a high probability of considerable financial loss 
Fundamentally speaking  stocks have rarely been as overvalued as they are here in February of 2017  Forward P Es for the S P 500 and the Russell 2000 are already competing with 2000 s tech bubble 

The Buffett Indicator
Other metrics  including market cap to GDP  a k a   Warren Buffett Indicator   are flashing black  blue and purple  And Shiller s P E  Other than 2000  you d have to go back to 1929 s infamous crash to uncover cyclical price to earnings ratios  PE10  that screamed louder 


So you do not believe in traditional fundamentals  Fair enough  Of course  even amateur technical analysts are taking notice of the fact that the MSCI All World Index via iShares MSCI ACWI ETF  NASDAQ ACWI  is more overbought than at any moment since July of 2014  Back then  after reaching similar extremes in the Relative Strength Index  RSI   global stock assets toiled for nine months before recovering 

Perhaps ironically  it is not just stocks that present difficulties for investors going forward  Consider the increasingly risky world of high yield bonds  Some investors are increasingly relying on price appreciation and income from ETFs like SPDR Barclay High Yield  NYSE JNK   That might be a major mistake 
At the moment  the excess yield that an investor is demanding above comparable  risk free  treasuries is around 3 85   With data going back to 1986  high yield bond investors should only anticipate a forward return that mirrors treasury bond performance with similar duration  Considering the genuine risk of loss in high yield  why would someone prefer the risky road over the risk free route 
Some data  like the data on Option Adjusted Spreads  OAS  only go back to 1995  Yet  even here  the evidence against adding high yield bonds to one s portfolio is powerful  In the chart below  high yield s upside is best when OAS spreads are much higher than they are currently  3 85    prospects on 4 year forward excess return over treasuries are relatively dismal when OAS spreads are as low as they are today   See red oval in chart below  

Still  the riskiest of financial assets continue hitting high after record breaking high  Perhaps Bill Gross at Janus  former bond king at PIMCO  has the answer  He recently explained that a 10 year yield at 2 45  is somewhat anchored  Why  In essence  as long as the European Central Bank  ECB  and the Bank of Japan  BOJ  collectively purchase  150 billions of their own low yielding bonds every month   0 10  on JGBs and 0 45  on German Bunds respectively   money then flows into the more attractive 10 Year U S  Treasury yields  Ergo  key borrowing costs tied to the 10 year cannot move up to levels that might trigger a U S  recession   Note  Gross marks a 10 year yield at 3 5  as enough for the U S  economy to shift into recession  

The  Gross assessment  may not be that far off  As much as Yellen may jawbone the idea that three Fed rate hikes in 2017 will materialize  in spite of under delivering tightening pledges in every year since the end of the Great Recession  some influential Fed participants are in no hurry to do any rate hikes  Minneapolis Fed Chairman Neel Kashkari highlights the labor slack that is evident in prime working age adults  25 54   Kashkari notes that the labor force participation and employment population ratios  while showing improvement  have yet to come close to the levels seen prior to the Great Recession 

The way things stand  then  risk asset bulls in stocks and junkier bonds see little chance of borrowing costs tightening meaningfully  Moreover  they regard Trump tax cuts and deregulation as monumental positives  while disregarding uncertainty in trade protectionism or unsustainable debt levels 
For the better part of 2009 2014  a widely diversified mix of 70  growth 30  income proved beneficial for the majority of my growth and income clients  Since the Fed s last asset purchase settled on December 18  2014  however  I had downshifted to 50  55  high quality growth  25  investment grade income and a  20  25   bucket of ultra low yielding cash  The tactical asset allocation shift worked particularly well in 2015 as well as for the first 10 months of 2016  we largely sidestepped the bulk of two harrowing market pullbacks 
Since the election of Trump  however  riskier assets have skyrocketed  A shift back to to our target for moderates  70  30   at election time could have captured more of the subsequent 9  10  S P 500 price appreciation 
Nevertheless  being  wrong  about how much longer risky assets will climb does not alter the poor risk reward prospects for chasing those overvalued risky assets  I share similar thoughts to those of Lowe s CEO  NYSE LOW  James Tisch  He recently expressed the following on his February 2017 earnings call 

 here is what I m seeing in the markets today  In the credit markets  spreads on the high yield securities are approaching historically tight levels  while key credit metrics such as leverage and coverage ratios are showing signs of weakening  The leverage loan market has been overrun by such massive inflows of capital that you could probably get a loan to buy a fleet of zeppelins at this point in time  the S P 500 is trading 3 turns higher than the 50 year average of 2016  These valuations make me uncomfortable  especially given the unknowns in taxation  foreign trade  regulation and more  To sum up  the markets are priced for perfection  and they have been that way for quite some time  complacency reigns supreme  However  my experience has shown me that this state of affairs won t go on indefinitely 

My guidance  Tread lightly  Markets that are priced for perfection rarely get what they have priced in ",2017-02-15,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-priced-for-perfection-rarely-get-what-they-‘price-in’-200175854,200175854
165798,387314,LOW,Epic Divide In Consumer Sentiment,opinion,"Consumer confidence is booming in America 
Well  let me clarify 
A peek at the chart of the official Consumer Sentiment Index paints a picture of booming confidence 
But charts can sometimes be liars 
So I decided to drill down on the confidence data myself 
What I discovered was shocking 

As it turns out  the chart is a worse liar than Hillary Clinton 
When you filter the data to represent only consumers who are Democrats  the index drops to 55 3   which is a cautionary signal of a deep recession 
Ah  but run the filter for Republicans only  and the index balloons to 122 4   signaling that an era of wonderful prosperity lies ahead 
Bottom line  we re a historically divided nation 
And with corporate tax reform up next  the epic divide could get even deeper 
I asked my senior analyst Martin Hutchinson to address the delicate issue of tax reform 
Hutch s outlook was grave 
So please make the proper tweaks to your portfolio before it s too late 
Question  Martin  Paul Ryan already blew health care reform  but now he s placing his full attention toward big corporate tax reform 
Can he get a win under his belt this time around 
Martin Hutchinson  Not if he does it the way the corporations want him to  Because just as on health care reform  the lobbyists have a wish list on corporate tax  They want a territorial system   whereby they get taxed in the U S  only on U S  income  And that s a terrible idea 
I ll tell you why  At present  they get taxed on worldwide income wherever it comes from  but only when the income is brought back to the U S  The system dates back to 1962  and it costs the fisc about  26 billion annually 
There are three problems  Firstly  this system encourages corporations to invest abroad  because they get a lower tax rate  Secondly  it leaves a huge pile of cash overseas   about  2 trillion at the moment  of which Amazon s got  100 billion   That can t be used to build U S  business before paying tax on it  Thirdly  it s grossly unfair  If an individual earns money overseas  they ve got to pay tax immediately on all of it except a measly  75 000 
Question  Clearly  the current system isn t working  I think you ve stated that  But why is a territorial system  perhaps  even worse 
Martin Hutchinson  The territorial system is worse because then they won t pay tax on international income at all  They would use transfer pricing and tax havens to make all their international operations tax free 
Consider if  for example  they re earning some money in France  which has a high tax rate  If you fiddle the transfer prices  you can make yourself earn very little in France and have a holding company in the Cayman Islands  One that earns all the money tax free 
Essentially  that would make international operations even more attractive relative to domestic ones  It would cause a giant sucking sound of money rushing out of the U S  toward foreign operations  Of course  it s even more unfair against individuals 
Question  If you could advise Paul Ryan on this  what would you recommend he do 
Martin Hutchinson  Well  I think they should have a worldwide tax system for paying tax exactly when it s earned   by all means deducting foreign tax paid  If you pay a lot of tax in France  that needs to be deducted against U S  tax  That s how earnings are recorded in the books  Because if you earn  1 million in France  it immediately comes in this year s income statement 
This would level the playing field between corporations and individuals  It would also level the playing field between domestic and foreign   because you d pay the same rate of tax on both 
If you wanted to  and it would make sense  you could then lower the overall corporation tax rate from the current 35  to  say  25  to compensate 
Question  I think we both agree that some type of reform is coming  Hutch  So what s the bottom line for investors 
Martin Hutchinson  I think they ll cut out some of the loopholes in corporate tax  Probably not this one  though  And they will cut the tax rate perhaps to 25  
The bottom line for investors is that companies that currently pay tax at a high rate will benefit from the tax rate coming down  For example  at the moment  Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  has paid tax at over 40  every year from 2013 16 
That s a big winner if the tax rate goes to 25   It increases its earnings by 25   because instead of keeping  0 60 on the dollar  it keeps  0 75 on the dollar  So Lowe s forward P E is currently 15 6  But that goes to 12 4 with the new tax rate  In addition  Lowe s also yields 1 7   So I think it s a pretty attractive play on corporate tax reform 
Question  Fantastic insights  Hutch  Thanks for your time 
Martin Hutchinson   great pleasure

Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings Beat
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Staples is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Staples has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 12 cents  Staples carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult   
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Following the verdict on the merger  Staples has outlined certain plans to increase long term value  The company is increasing its offering of products as well as services beyond office supplies in order to acquire new customers  Staples expects to improve its supply chain capabilities through the addition of more than 1 000 associates to its mid market sales team 
On the other hand  the challenges across the office supplies sector and unfavorable currency fluctuations remain concerns for Staples  The company s cost cutting and other initiatives hold promise for the long run but not for the short term  as reflected by management s cautious stance  For the fiscal second quarter  it anticipates sales to fall from the prior year quarter level  Adjusted earnings per share is projected in the range of 11 cents 13 cents 
Sluggish international sales continue to concern Staples  International sales had dropped 18 9   17 2   16 8  and 12   during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015  respectively  During first quarter fiscal 2016  revenues from international operations declined 5 6   reflecting lower comps in Europe  International sales were soft owing to a weak macroeconomic environment  particularly in Europe  Though European restructuring is on track  currency headwinds might prove to be a drag STAPLES INC Price and EPS Surprise

 Hold you horses  says the chart  The Wave principle states that trends move in repetitive patterns  called  waves   The direction of the trend is indicated by a five wave sequences  known as  or impulsive waves  but every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  before the trend resumes  As the chart shows  Lowe s five wave pattern is not over yet  It appears to be approaching the end of it third wave  labeled with  III   In this respect  the crash of 2007 2009 is supposed to be wave  II   So  wave  IV  down should be expected from now on 
There are three guidelines we could use to determine the depth of wave  IV   First  fourth waves usually retrace back to the area between the 23 6  and the 38 2   to the third wave  Second  fourth waves  often slightly breach the lower line of the trend channel  drawn through the tops of waves one and three of the impulse  And third  fourth waves typically retrace back to the termination area of previous fourth waves  With all that being said  we could expect Lowe s wave  IV  to fall to the zone between 65 and 57 dollars a share  In other words  the stock might lose between 19 and 27 dollars per share from its recent top at 83 65  That is quite similar to the amount it lost between 2007 and 2009  So the question investors have to ask themselves is whether they wish to have bought Lowe s stock in February 2007   No  seems to be the obvious answer in 2016  as well ",2016-08-09,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/it-is-2007-again-for-lowe’s-investors-200146868,200146868

165883,387399,LOW,Will Wal Mart s  WMT  Earnings Surpass Estimates In Q2 ,opinion,"We expect Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT   to beat expectations when it reports fiscal second quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 18 
Last quarter  this retail giant posted a positive earnings surprise of 11 36   We note that the company has posted positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters and a negative surprise in the remaining quarter  translating to an average positive surprise of 4 01  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement WAL MART STORES Price and EPS Surprise   Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Wal Mart is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  0 98   This is meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Wal Mart carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which when combined with a  0 98  ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat 
Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2 or  3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks   4 and  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  
What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
Wal Mart has been making efforts to understand the evolving needs of its customers to regain their confidence  and thus boost sales  It has delivered positive comps in the U S  in the last seven quarters  Lower fuel prices aided sales as it eased consumers  spending power  E commerce has also contributed to the company s sales  The company expects the trend of positive comps at Wal Mart U S  to continue in the soon to be reported quarter 
Wal Mart expects U S  comp sales growth of around 1  for the 13 week period ending Jul 29 compared with 1 5  comps growth last year  Sam s Club comp sales  without the impact of fuel sales  are expected to be slightly positive compared with 1 3  growth last year 
Wal Mart is also making huge investments in e commerce initiatives to compete with the biggest online retailer Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   and to improve customer service  The company has recently sold its Chinese e commerce business Yihaodian to local retailer JD com to expand its reach in China 
The Bentonville  AR based company is also paying higher wages to its workers and training them to improve its stores performance  However  these initiatives have increased expenses for the company  This along with unfavorable currency will take a toll on earnings 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2017  earnings are expected in a range of 95 cents to  1 08 per share  compared with the prior year quarter s earnings of  1 08 per share

Stocks to Buy with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio

You can simply arrive at a decision to  Buy  or  Sell  a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision 

A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged through coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  The focus of this article is on Interest Coverage which is one such ratio 

Why Interest Coverage Ratio 

Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt 

Debt  which is very important for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision 

Formula    Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense   Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest 

An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations  and could default in repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time 

The Winning Strategy

Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results 

Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry Median

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median    Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history 

Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median    This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

VGM Score of less than or equal to B    Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

Here are seven of the 25 stocks that qualified the screening

165954,387470,LOW,7 Stocks With Exciting Interest Coverage Ratio To Buy Now,opinion,A layman might get himself trapped if he decides to pick a stock only by looking at its shooting numbers in a real time stock screen  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the true picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here the role of coverage ratios comes to play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is very important for financing operations for a majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Formula  Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense  The  Interest Coverage Ratio  suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm possesses for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations  and could default in repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM

165982,387498,LOW,Lowe s Gains On Earnings Beat,opinion,"Lowe s Companies Inc   NYSE LOW 

On Wednesday before the market opened  Lowe s announced first quarter earnings that topped analyst estimates and gave shares a boost in the pre market session  The home improvement company announced earnings per share of 98 cents on  15 23 billion while analysts were looking for 85 cents per share on  14 87 billion in revenues  This compares to the same period ending last year when the company posted earnings per share of 70 cents on  14 13 billion in revenues  LOW also stated that same store sales rose by 7 5  for the first quarter topping analyst estimates of 4 7   Currently analysts have an average price target of  83 96 
Looking at the chart you will see that shares got a nice bump in the pre market session with highs hitting  78 35 after closing Tuesday at  76 07  a 2 9  jump in price  Shares made it over a big hurtle by getting over the big  78 level and ideally we will want to see them hold this to confirm the strength of this move but if shares open lower then it could act as a strong resistance level  Look for support to come in at  77 63 followed by  76  Shares are trading well above their 200 day moving average that is currently sitting at  72 40 and have recently made a nice bounce off  63 a couple months back  Shares have traded in a tight range between the  77 and  75 levels the past month but are looking to break it with this fresh news catalyst on the wire  After yesterdays selloff in the SPY  NYSE SPY   we will want to be careful taking a long position above  78 but there should be plenty of volume and volatility to take create some good trading opportunities so we ll just have to time our entries so we don t over pay 
CEO Comments

We executed well in the quarter  growing both transaction and average ticket to achieve comparable sales growth that exceeded our expectations   commented Robert A  Niblock  Lowe s chairman  president and CEO   We continued to focus on providing better omni channel customer experiences  and saw strength in indoor as well as outdoor categories

Factors Influencing the Upcoming ResultsAmerican Eagle has been benefiting from its merchandise related initiatives as well as actions taken to improve operational performance  Moreover  the company has been strengthening its global presence for some time now after witnessing strong profitability at its overseas licensed stores  with little capital requirements  While the company s attempt to grow globally is likely to help it in augmenting business and meeting global demand  it also leads to adverse currency movements and other international risks  which remain concerns Additionally  high dependence on external suppliers and macroeconomic headwinds may dampen the upcoming results  Thus  we would prefer to wait and see what s in store for American Eagle in the quarter to be reported Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively project an earnings beat for American Eagle this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 to surpass earnings estimates  However  this is not the case here due to the following factors Zacks ESP  ESP for American Eagle is 0 00  since both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at 18 cents per share Zacks Rank  American Eagle carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is undergoing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Lowe s Companies Inc    NYSE LOW    scheduled to report earnings on May 18  has an Earnings ESP of  2 41  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Best Buy Co  Inc    NYSE BBY    scheduled to report earnings on May 24  has an Earnings ESP of  2 94  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  DSW Inc    NYSE DSW    scheduled to report earnings on May 24  has an Earnings ESP of  2 17  and a Zacks Rank  3 ",2016-05-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-eagle-(aeo):-will-it-disappoint-in-q1-earnings-200129528,200129528

The turn in Fed sentiment was reinforced by comments from member Dudley today  adding momentum to the tide of USD losses seen across the board  though to varying degrees  Post BoJ positioning was being reversed from early London  and we eventually took out the Asia lows  but it was not until the loss of 119 00 that the stop loss selling really gathered momentum  Soft US ISM added to USD woes  contributing to the removal of 118 00 en route to 117 50 with the turn in US equities yet another downside force  Concurrent Fed based risk off moves finally saw EUR USD taking out 1 1000  with stop loss buying extending through 1 1075  The crosses were notably quiet given market drivers  That AUD gains vs the USD were contained later in the day highlighted the impact on stocks  M A news  Lowe s  N LOW  buying Canada s Rona  TO RON   gave USD CAD the much needed push through 1 3900  but holding off 1 3825 00 support  the larger crude build reported by the DoE saw a return through 1 3900  but this has proved temporary  WTI eventually dropped back under  30 0  so this may lend some support  The tide has certainly turned in GBP  where sweeping cable gains took us to within 5 ticks of 1 4600  Better than f c services PMI helped  but EU concessions the key factor in this",2016-02-03,Talking Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/daily-fx-wrap---03-02-16-383099,383099
166130,387646,LOW,The Low May Be In For Lowe s,opinion,"Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  had been on a strong run higher until it started a sideways movement after Thanksgiving  The price action was very interesting as it traced out a near perfect bearish Shark harmonic through to the beginning of March  It then retraced the entire pattern  making a double bottom at 44 50 
This raised the question of whether the it was time to buy  The pullback in June scared out many  but since then the price action has been tightening against resistance  and I am here to tell you the Low is in for Lowes  Well maybe that is a it premature but let me explain 

The chart above shows that Shark and the double bottom  but what is more interesting now is the ascending triangle forming at the far right of the chart  As the price approaches the top at 48 50 it has support for a push through from three other indicators  The RSI is in the bullish zone over 60 and rising  The MACD crossed up today  The Bollinger bands are opening to the upside  A push through that 48 50 level and the Low will truly be in for now  This would also establish a target of 52 from the pattern  which would be a new all time high

166161,387677,LOW,Italy  The Dragon And The Cricket ,opinion,The difficulty in making sense of the results of the Italian election has produced the common imagery of a clown to capture the comic Grillo  who appears to be the most unlikely politician since Lech Walesa  the unemployed electrician that led Solidarity in Poland  helping to bring the fatal crisis upon the Soviet Union  and the general disdain for Berlusconi  whose political career appears driven as much by the need to avoid prison as anything else  While understandable  it confuses name calling for analysis Moreover  it does not do justice to the two key forces in Italy  the dragon  Draghi  the president of the ECB  and Grillo  which means  cricket  in Italian  the head of what has emerged as the largest single political party  his 5 Star Movement  M5S   The near term political future appears to be in Grillo s hands and there will be much speculation ahead of the end of the week when the Italian parliament will formally gather  for the first time since the election  to select a president of each chamber When Fitch cut Italy s credit rating to BBB  from A before the weekend  it cited the inconclusive election that is not conducive to structural reforms  It also weakens Italy s ability to respond to shocks  such deeper domestic contraction or a broader crisis within the euro area  Pshaw  It was simply a timely excuse to align its rating  It was the outlier  It matches what S P had done a year ago and is still above Moody s Baa2  equivalent to BBB   Fitch s move contains no new information  Earlier in the week  the DBRS cut its rating of Italy to A  low   One of the important implications of additional downgrades  and as it is on negative watch by all these agencies  it is a realistic possibility   is that it will increase the haircut applied to Italian bonds as collateral with the ECB  Italian banks appear to have a sufficient cash cushion to absorb the hit initially  but the degrees of freedom can be exhausted quickly  In turn  this suggests why Italian banks do not appear to have returned much of their LTRO borrowings and why they won t until the situation is clarified  which could take the better part of the remainder of the year  Cricket  not clown may be a more apropos image of the 5 Star Movement  There are several characteristics of a cricket that are revealing  Crickets are easily and often confused with something they are not  grasshoppers   The males of both do make a chirping sound  but the cricket is more noise than action  Grasshoppers are pests and plague farmers  Crickets are considerably less harmful  perhaps because they live for a few weeks  while a grasshopper can live for a year  What also may prove prescient  crickets are known to eat their own dead  Aside from America s experience  revolutions are often known to eat their children  Grillo heads up a movement  and is probably as surprised as anyone with the electoral outcome  Just like nature abhors a vacuum so do politics  and as a movement the M5S moved into the vacuum created by four separate  even if related  developments  First  on the European level  there appears to be a lack of leadership from those  like French President Hollande  to articulate a practical vision of EMU that is not dominated by the interests of the creditors  Second  within Italy  the center left coalition  PD  failed to offer an alternative to Monti s austerity program  Third  no group speaks for the high unemployment among college educated young people  Fourth  there was no local expression of the Occupy Movement  the Pirate Party in Germany  or a non marxist ecological movement  The key issue is whether Grillo can form a party out of the movement  Despite early successes  the Pirate Party in Germany appears to be imploding as members save their most vile recriminations for each other  rather than their opponents  The Occupy Movement has not crystallized into a party  The Tea Party has been among the most successful  perhaps because it is essentially a faction within a party  and its story still seems to be unfolding  though by some reckoning  it has passed its peak in terms of influencing the agenda  Berlusconi seemed to campaign against Germany and Merkel  whom he implies forced him out of the office back in late 2011  Grillo  on the other hand  seemed to campaign more against Europe  While the two may seem similar  Grillo s line of attack is broader and more profound  Grillo s rhetoric gave expression to a powerful antagonism against the elite  Although Berlusconi is not liked by the Italian elites  he is one of them  They are the target of Grillito s scorn  The M5S program blurs the political spectrum  Although Grillo is 64  he successfully articulates the angst of the well educated  but under employed and unemployed  young people  One study of the Gillitos found 46  come from the left and 39  from the right  They are inheriting an economy that posts meager growth even in the best of times  a high public sector debt burden  and a political culture of corruption  even after the Clean Hands drive and the expunging of a previous political elite We can recognize Abenomics as monetary and fiscal stimulus on steroids  but Grillonomics is a kaleidoscope of ideas that is more like a movement s slogans than planks of a party platform  Indeed  as the M5S becomes more programmatic and specific  the less cohesive it will become  Much to their surprise  the M5S may also find that politics make strange bedfellows  In the name of anti bureaucracy  and to reduce the arena of public corruption  Grillo has called for extreme deregulation and privatization and large scale reduction in the number of civil servants  He wants to end the state monopoly on the railways  This gives him much in common with the right  The xenophobic and anti immigration strain that is evident also appeals to some on the right  In other ways  Grillo is more to the left than the PD  He wants the state to give 1000 euros a month to every one  Grillo has advocated tying managers  salaries to average worker pay and break up  and or nationalize  the banks and industrial monopolies  The M5S speaks more to those on the make than those who have been made  Grillo s proposals  including tying the universities more to business and raising health care charges  suggest a desire to re write the social contract  The danger is that the changes he seeks may weaken the very constituency he represents  For example  renegotiating Italy s debt sounds like a swell idea  lighten the burden for the generation coming of age or came of age recently  Yet 60  of Italy s debt is owned domestically  A debt restructuring would hurt Italian pensioners  hit household savings  and trigger a financial crisis  not just in Italy  but all of Europe  The economic consequences would be severe  It is unclear how the M5S and its constituents would benefit from leaving the monetary union  which Grillo has threatened  The result would make the current recession look desirable in comparison  Any competitive gain by a new and devalued lira would be offset with what likely would be a sharp increase in interest rates and a financial crisis  Moreover  and very importantly  outside the EMU  the need for structural reforms becomes even more urgent Indeed  the latest ISOP poll found 74  of Italians favor retaining the euro  with only 16  wanting to go back to the lira  More than two thirds of Italians are not in favor of an EMU referendum  leaving slightly less than a third wanting one The World Bank ranks Italy near the middle of the world in terms of its Doing Business evaluations  which is rather poor for a high income country  Of note  Italy  ranks 160th in enforcing contracts  131 in paying taxes  107 in getting electricity and 103 in dealing with construction permits At the recent ECB meeting  Draghi showed no urgency to take additional measures to help ease the economic contraction or blunt the tightening of financial conditions  seen in the contraction in loans to the private sector and weak money supply growth  While willing to counter threats against the EMU itself  the ECB quite tolerant of market forces pressuring governments to do the  right thing  The ECB s Outright Market Transaction scheme is not relevant in the current circumstances for Italy  Recall that the pre conditions require a programmatic agreement with the EU  Italy is far from that  By some reckoning  Spain is still closer  though Spanish bonds have benefited from the political uncertainty in Italy Italian bonds and stocks have recouped much of the initial losses seen in the immediate aftermath of the election  Italy has among the smallest budget deficits in Europe and is the only one with a primary surplus  To service its debt  however  Italy does have to sell about 30 bln euros of bills and bonds a month  It is trying to extend maturities  where the average is already at the upper end of the euro area   a little more than 7 years  There have been reports that the ECB was contemplating leaving the Troika  EU  IMF and ECB   but there is not a formal group as such and the reports were denied  Nevertheless  the kernel of truth is that the ECB is increasingly isolated within the group that has acted as the financial judge and jury of the euro area sovereigns The EU is considering giving several countries extra time to reach their fiscal targets  The IMF has  a bit belatedly  recognized that the fiscal multiplier  the impact of a cut in government spending on the overall economy  is greater than it previously assumed  It is more sympathetic to an official sector participation in debt restructuring  such as in Greece  although it insists that it is excluded  IMF s Lagarde has also called on the ECB to cut rates and reiterated her call over in recent days Lagarde recognizes that lower inflation and wage restraint in the periphery requires somewhat higher inflation and wages in countries like Germany  which the ECB is reluctant to see  Yet  almost on cue  the 765k state government workers  represented by Verdi  in Germany reached a 2 year agreement on March 9  for a wage increase  which at 5 6   is above the inflation rate  It includes a 2 65  this year  retroactive to Jan 1 and a 2 95  hike next Jan  The agreement effects 15 German states  Only Hesse which is not part of the collective agreement  is not formally taking part German inflation is stood at 1 5  in Feb  the lowest since December 2010  Recall last March the federal and municipal workers received a 6 3  wage increase over two years  Even if the cynics are right and electoral considerations  election in Sept  are playing a role  the fact is that the increase in German labor costs may help the re balancing of euro area growth more than the harsh austerity alone in the periphery A dragon he may be  but Draghi is does not breathe fire any more  The high bar to triggering OMT means that it cannot be implemented quickly  or as part of a crisis response program  With the zero deposit rate the real anchor for short term rates  even a 25 bp cut in the 75 bp refi rate will only have minimal impact  Easing collateral rules remains possible  but there is a reluctance  especially by the creditor nations  to risk weakening the ECB s balance sheet any more Meanwhile  the ball is in the crickets  court  Grillo and the M5S movement are hardly a political party  though it is clearly a force to be reckoned with  Some of its program will likely be assimilated by the right and left  More than a little late  Monti himself softened his austerity push in the last days of the campaign  The election may prove cathartic  an expression of frustration and dissatisfaction with the political elite in Italy  but the Italian body politic is not about to decapitate itself ,2013-03-10,Marc

166162,387678,LOW,Some Lesser Known Low Volatility Explanations ,opinion,If you read the academic literature on the low volatility anomaly  you find they are focused on the Ang  Hodrick  Xing and Zhang papers of and   This is funny for a couple reasons   Bob Hodrick was chairman of the Northwestern Finance department when I was there back in 1994  and was completely indifferent to my dissertation on the negative relation between idiosyncratic returns and stock returns  Befitting academics  his subsequent landmark 2006 paper emphasized a new risk factor based on a stock s covariance with volatility innovations  This is standard stochastic discount function asset pricing  looking for more subtle risk factors that could save the paradigm  What they found here was obviously boring because no one mentions that angle  but rather the incidental mention that simple stock variance was hugely negatively related to returns cross sectionally  Consistent with my earlier experience with Hodrick  I imagine he couldn t accept the result as real or interesting except in the context of some convoluted risk factor explanation  so the seminal academic result had to be packaged as an add on to a  legitimate  hypothesis  one now recognized as pointless but was initially essential  Further  once a major pub mentioned it  one could address it without having people simply dismiss it as impossible because  theoretically  it doesn t happen  further  explanations could proceed unbounded  as while the introduction needed the  risk factor  farcical explanation  secondary ones did not  It reminds me of my favorite Darwin quote  False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science  for they often long endure  but false views  if supported by some evidence  do little harm  as every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness  The fact that low volatility outperforms the average  and higher volatility greatly underperforms  was not an obvious fact in the 1990 s even though I tried to explain this to people  though I wasn t working within some accepted theoretical framework  so my fact was not acknowledged  The fact of the negative volatility idiosyncratic volatility beta and returns is now legitimate  and around 2005 you had several independent institutional funds operating on the premise  so clearly the fact was in the air independent of Ang  Hodrick  Xing and Zheng  I personally had applied it as a C corp from 1996 trying to get support  and eventually found a way to a hedge fund where I applied it at that time  Thus  I m convinced it s not a figment of measurement error because I actually traded it and made money off it  and know people who have large funds that have outperformed their benchmarks applying this insight   The Ang et al papers clearly show that total and idiosyncratic volatility give the same results  so all the focus on idiosyncratic makes the result seem much less robust than it is   Anyway  I was reading a piece on explanations  and this highlighted other pieces  etc  I eventually read through this thread  Most I think are not interesting  though most are well worth reading to make sure  I m intrigued by the assertion that stocks that have active short interest have a positive risk premium  Obviously  getting all that data together on short interest is non trivial so I m not sure it s true  I like to see it myself  otherwise I generally don t believe it   These are mainly papers published around 2010 and 2011 1   Peter Wong Earnings momentum and post announcement drift explains most of low vol return  in that low returning high vol stocks have poor returns  repeatedly2   Jiang  Xu  and Yao  Once we control for future earning shocks  there is no longer a significantly negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and future stock returns   3   George and Hwang  we show that the negative relations between returns and idiosyncratic volatility  and returns and turnover volatility  exist only among low coverage stocks   4   Boehme  Danielsen  Kumar  and Sorescu  When short sale constraints are absent  both idiosyncratic risk and dispersion of analyst forecasts are positively correlated with future abnormal returns for firms with low visibility  consistent with Merton  However  stocks with higher analyst dispersion and idiosyncratic volatility have negative abnormal returns when short sale constraints are present  consistent with Miller  See graph at right for main idea  5   Han  Hu  and Lesmond  Once we extract measurement errors in prices caused by the bid ask spread we find little evidence in the pricing ability for idiosyncratic volatility     the closing price based idiosyncratic volatility estimate  using the three factor model  for the developed markets  excluding the U S   shows a significant  at 1  level  alpha of  0 926  per month  consistent with the findings of Ang et al   2009   while the quote midpoint return based idiosyncratic volatility estimate demonstrates an insignificant alpha of only  0 474  per month   6   Fangjian Fu  Since idiosyncratic volatilities are time varying  the one month lagged idiosyncratic volatility may not be an appropriate proxy for the expected idiosyncratic volatility of this month    A zero investment portfolio that is long in the 10  of the highest and short in the 10  of the lowest conditional idiosyncratic volatilities earns a positive return of 1 75  in a month  These findings support the theory prediction that idiosyncratic risk is positively related to expected returns   7   Han and Kumar  stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility and skewness  or lower prices are predominately held and actively traded by retail investors  while institutional investors under weight those stocks  We also find that the characteristics of the retail clienteles of high RTP  retail trade participation  stocks are very similar to the characteristics of investors who exhibit greater propensity to speculate and gamble as documented in Kumar  2009    Both approaches show that high RTP stocks have significantly lower average returns   8   Bali Cakici  and Whitelaw   When sorted first on maximum returns  the equal weighted return difference between high and low idiosyncratic volatility portfolios is positive and both economically and statistically significant   A slightly different interpretation of our evidence is that extreme positive returns proxy for skewness  and investors exhibit a preference for skewness   9   Chabi Yo andYang  We find that there is a negative  positive  relation between idiosyncratic coskewness and equity returns when idiosyncratic coskewness betas are positive  negative   We construct two idiosyncratic coskewness factors to capture market wide effect of idiosyncratic coskewness betas  When we control for these two idiosyncratic coskewness factors  the return difference for distress sorted portfolios becomes insignificant   10   Hou and Loh  On the other hand  explanations based on expected idiosyncratic skewness  maximum daily return  retail trading proportion  one month return reversal  pre  and post formation earnings shocks show promise in explaining the puzzle    Collectively  the above explanations account for roughly 60 80  of the puzzle   11   Timothy C  Johnson   I offer a simple explanation for this phenomenon based on the interpretation of dispersion as a proxy for unpriced information risk arising when asset values are unobservable  The relationship then follows from a general options pricing result  For a levered firm  expected returns should always decrease with the level of idiosyncratic asset risk   12   Avramov  Chordia  Jostova and Philipov   Strategies based on price momentum  earnings momentum  credit risk  dispersion  idiosyncratic volatility  and capital investments derive their profitability from taking short positions in high credit risk firms that experience deteriorating credit conditions   13   Cao    Simin  and Zhao  Empirically both the level and variance of corporate growth options are significantly related to idiosyncratic volatility  Accounting for growth options eliminates or reverses the trend in aggregate firm specific risk  These results are robust for different measures of idiosyncratic volatility  different growth option proxies  across exchanges  and through time   14   Chen and Petkova   We decompose aggregate market variance into an average correlation component and an average variance component  Only the latter commands a negative price of risk in the cross section of portfolios sorted by idiosyncratic volatility  Portfolios with high  low  idiosyncratic volatility relative to the Fama French  1993  model have positive  negative  exposures to innovations in average stock variance and therefore lower  higher  expected returns  ,2013-04-01,Eric
