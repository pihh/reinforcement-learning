171035,392551,ADM,Burger King picks Unilever to make plant based Whoppers in Europe,news,"By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO  Reuters    Burger King on Monday rolled out a meat free version of its Whopper burger in 25 European countries  using patties made by  Unilever  Plc  L ULVR  to strengthen its foothold in the exploding market for plant based food served in restaurant chains 
Heightened concerns about health and the environmental impact of industrial animal farming are pushing plant based proteins into restaurant menus and chilled meat aisles in stores  Companies from  Beyond Meat Inc   O BYND  to Impossible Foods Inc are competing fiercely for deals with fast food makers  as plant based mania spreads across Europe and the United States 
Unilever s meat free brand The Vegetarian Butcher  which had yet to strike a deal with a major restaurant chain  will supply patties for the  Rebel Whopper  to over 2 500 stores in countries including Germany  Spain  Poland and Italy  The burgers will be Burger King s biggest ever product launch in Europe 
Demand for plant based products has increased over the last couple of years and trying to meet that is crucial  said David Shear  who heads Burger King operations in Europe  the Middle East and Africa  Shear said in an interview that this initial rollout would eventually expand elsewhere in the region 
The Rebel Whopper will be priced similarly to its beef counterpart in Europe   a departure from the norm in North America  where plant based burgers typically cost  1  1 50 more than meat patties  For instance  the plant based Whopper that Silicon Valley based Impossible Foods makes for Burger King costs  5 59  vs   4 19 for a beef Whopper  The company  which is owned by Brazilian controlled 3G Capital via its majority stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc  TO QSR  said prices may vary between franchises 
Restaurant Brands said last month that the Impossible Whopper had become one of Burger King s most successful launches ever 
Burger King began testing a different version of the Rebel Whopper in Sweden this summer  tying up with Dutch faux meat maker Vivera BV  That contract will eventually be transferred to Unilever  Shear said  Burger King this month starts selling another plant based Rebel Whopper throughout Brazil  made by meatpacker Marfrig Global Foods SA  SA MRFG3  in partnership with commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  ",2019-11-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/burger-king-picks-unilever-to-make-plantbased-whoppers-in-europe-2018375,2018375

171038,392554,ADM,Exclusive  In break from past  Louis Dreyfus boss is open to selling stake,news,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON  Reuters    After 169 years of keeping the business in the family  agricultural commodity giant Louis Dreyfus Company  LDC  is open to selling a large non controlling stake to an external stakeholder  its chairwoman told Reuters 
Margarita Louis Dreyfus  who assumed control of the company in 2009  stressed she was in no rush and that an investor would have to strengthen the business 
Last year  the billionaire businesswoman completed consolidating Louis Dreyfus Company Holdings B V   LDHBV    the structure that holds the family s shares in LDC   via her Akira family trust which now controls over 96  of the holding firm 
She has spent a decade negotiating costly and acrimonious buyouts of minority family shareholders  while profits at LDC declined in increasingly tough agricultural markets 
 It is the first time in our almost 170 year history that we are prepared to open our capital to an external shareholder   the 57 year old said in an interview 
 But we are not under pressure  We want to keep majority control  Everything else depends on the quality of offers  
The group has previously indicated it could bring  regional players  into the business to help strengthen its positions in areas where it seeks expansion  such as China 
Akira s consolidation of LDC s ownership has come at a cost  it borrowed  1 billion from  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  last year to buy out the minority shareholders  pledging its shares in LDC as collateral  its filing showed 
Credit Suisse declined to comment 
This comes at a time when LDC  like its rivals  faces a challenging business environment   with swine fever in China  which could hit economic growth and protein demand in the world s largest consumer of pork  as well as the coronavirus outbreak 
 NOW COMPANY IS FREE 
LDC  also known as Dreyfus  is the  D  of the  ABCD  quartet of global agri traders that also includes Archer Daniels Midland  N ADM    Bunge   N BG  and Cargill  UL CARG  
Like its peers  LDC has restructured operations  exiting activities including dairy and metals trading while focusing more on food processing  notably in Asia 
The company s top priority was to develop its business  said Louis Dreyfus  a Russian born Swiss citizen 
 Until 2018 we were in a process of consolidating the company s shareholder structure  Now the company is free of that issue and can fully focus on the business  
A new investor should bring value to strengthen the company  she said 
 It is not only about size  It is also about quality  
Speculation about consolidation has been rife in the industry since takeover approaches for U S  based Bunge 
Commodity group  Glencore   L GLEN  made an approach for Bunge two years ago and has said the sector needs consolidating  China s COFCO International has also been seen as a potential bidder for other trading firms as it expands overseas 
 ADAPTING TO NEW REALITY 
In October 2019  Dreyfus reported a first half net profit from continuing operations of  73 million  down from  91 million a year earlier  and said international trade tensions and the swine disease epidemic would weigh on its annual profit 
Full year 2019 results will be published later this year  Louis Dreyfus said it would show a  resilient  bottom line despite a challenging backdrop of swine fever and trade tensions  which depressed U S  soybean imports into China 
 We are adapting to a new reality of higher volatility and political unpredictability   Louis Dreyfus said  adding that a recovery of crush margins    the profits made from processing soybeans    and cost savings should help 2020 results 
A cost cutting programme announced internally in November is being led by new Chief Operating Officer Michael Gelchie  whose appointment was part of a recent management reshuffle  the latest in a series of changes 
 We are cautiously optimistic that we shall see a rebound in 2020   she said 
Over the past decade  Louis Dreyfus has bought the shares of minority family members wishing to sell under a long term arrangement established by her late husband  Robert  Akira increased its ownership in LDHBV to over 96  from 50 1  
 In fact  all we have been doing these years is following Robert s guidance to develop the company s strategy   she said ",2020-01-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-in-break-from-past-louis-dreyfus-boss-is-open-to-selling-stake-2071885,2071885
171039,392555,ADM,Is Archer Daniels Midland  ADM  A Good Stock To Pick Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Archer Daniels Midland has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 05  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 08  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Archer Daniels Midland puts current PE ratio above its midpoint  which is 16 07  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staple sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Archer Daniels Midland has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 99  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  the stock has a P S ratio of about 0 41  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 47 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Archer Daniels Midland currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ADM a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall 
Though Archer Daniels Midland might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives ADM a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while current year estimate has seen two downward and two upward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 16 7  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has fallen 2 3  in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus    Due to this bearish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineArcher Daniels Midland is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 34  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2019-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-archerdanielsmidland-adm-a-good-stock-to-pick-now-200495139,200495139

President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Victoria  Good morning  everyone  Thank you all for joining us today  This morning  we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of  1 42  up from  0 88 in the prior year quarter  Our adjusted segment operating profit was slightly above  1 billion  Our return on invested capital was 7 5   above both our 2019 WACC of 6 75  and our long term WACC of 7   We re continuing to drive toward our long term ROIC goal of 10   The team delivered solid results this quarter  and I m proud of how they performed both over the last three months and throughout the year  We managed through a difficult external environment by keeping our focus on strong execution  continued improvement efforts and by providing winning solutions for our customers  And given our performance  we are today announcing a quarterly dividend increase of  0 01 per share to  0 36 per quarter  This dividend will be our 353rd consecutive quarterly payment and an interrupted record of 88 years I m proud to look back on a year in which we delivered significant advancements in each of our strategic pillars  In our optimize pillar  we advanced key business improvements and are seeing the results of our work at the Decatur corn complex and in our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts business  We reshaped our North American wheat milling footprint  closing all less efficient mills and opening our brand new  state of the art facility in Mendota  We completed the significant global organization redesign  including offering early retirement for certain North American colleagues and reducing management layers that is helping us enhance productivity and efficiency  And just in the fourth quarter  we entered into an agreement to sell our palm plantation operations in Brazil and sold our investment in CIP  advancing our ongoing efforts to ensure our asset portfolio maximizes returns and aligns with our core competencies In our drive pillar  we launched the Ag Services and Oilseeds business unit  And we re delivering on the synergies created by simplifying the business model including capital reduction efforts  More widely  as part of our readiness efforts  we introduced a companywide simplification initiative  which is streamlining decision making and processes in order to drive accountability and realize additional value in the way we work  And we continued to drive standardization and efficiency by centralizing critical activities  including our new global operations organization  In our expand pillar  we expanded on our leadership position in the fast growing alternative proteins through our partnership with Marfrig and by working with many other customers to create systems and solutions to meet their needs  We enhanced our global citrus platform with the addition of Florida Chemical and Ziegler  and we cut the ribbon on our expansion and enhancement of our flavor production capabilities in Beijing  We created an unparalleled global leader in animal nutrition  thanks to the addition of Neovia  And I m extremely pleased with the integration  including running ahead of our internal targets for synergies And just in the last three months    in the last few months  we further expanded our animal nutrition capabilities with the opening of our state of the art technology center in Decatur and our new feed production facility in Vietnam  We continue to build our leadership position in the key market of food  beverages and supplements that enhance health and wellness with the acquisition of Brazil based Yerbalatina Phytoactives  a pioneering leader in plant based extracts  And we further enhanced our global destination marketing footprint this time expanding into Turkey  capping a year in which our overall destination marketing volumes grew by 10   Please turn to slide four  A year ago  I called 2019 the year in which readiness would accelerate moving beyond the introductory phase to become a driver of our culture and how we do our work every day The enterprise has been laser focused on readiness  which shows in our execution  By the end of 2019  we had completed 435 readiness initiatives that  in total  will account for  815 million in run rate benefits on an annual basis  We remain on target to reach  1 2 billion in annual run rate benefits by the end of 2020  For 2019  specifically  readiness has contributed approximately  250 million in accrued net benefits in line with our goal  I m also proud that we achieved an important internal goal  As of the end of 2019  31 000 colleagues have completed our comprehensive Ability to Execute training since the program began  We continue to implement new innovative initiatives as a result of readiness  For example  this quarter  we launched two new technologies  The first will help us more efficiently interact with our customers by providing new tools to our sales team The second is allowing us to centralize and automate our truck dispatch and tendering in North America  What is even more impressive to see  however  is how our team has integrated readiness and its recurrent discipline into their everyday work  Our readiness evaluation and tracking system is now routinely applied to projects  large and smaller alike  The  what else can we do to be better  mindset is helping to guide actions and investments  become a part of who we are as a company  which was one of our goals from the start Now Ray will take us through our business performance  Ray Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Juan  Please turn to slide number five  As Juan mentioned  adjusted EPS for the quarter was  1 42  up from the  0 88 in the prior year quarter  The adjusted EPS number includes a benefit of about  0 61 per share related to the impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credits  representing an approximately 50 50 split of retroactive benefits for 2018 and 2019  Excluding specified items  adjusted segment operating profit was about  1 billion  up 20   For the full calendar year  our adjusted segment operating profit was approximately  3 1 billion and adjusted EPS for the full year 2019 was  3 24  Our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7 5   higher than our 2019 annual WACC of 6 75   The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately a positive 1  credit compared to a positive 2  credit in the prior year The calendar year 2019 effective tax rate was 13  compared to 12  in 2018  The low 2019 tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the U S  tax credit signed into law at the end of the year  The low 2018 rate is due primarily to the impact of favorable true ups related to U S  tax reform  In the absence of the tax credits and specified items  the effective tax rate for calendar year 2019 would have been about 19   Looking ahead  we re expecting a full year 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16  to 19   We generated about  2 3 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year  lower than 2018  Return of capital for the full year was about  940 million including about  150 million in opportunistic share repurchases  We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 29   up from the 25  in the year ago quarter but continuing to improve from the first quarter high related to the acquisition of Neovia Capital spending for the year was  828 million  in line with our guidance and considerably below our depreciation and amortization rate of about  1 billion as we focused on harvesting our prior investments  In 2020  we expect to continue to spend below our depreciation and amortization rate but higher than 2019 as we make investments in our business transformation program  Next slide  please  Our business results were  13 million  significantly above the prior year period  Captive insurance results were negative but significantly improved year over year  ADM Investor Services results were up versus the prior year period  For 2020  we expect claims and underwriting performance to improve for our captive insurance operations  resulting in the expected Other segment performance to be about  100 million for the calendar year  In the corporate lines  unallocated costs of  193 million were higher year over year principally due to increased spending in IT and business transformation and higher benefits accrual costs Other charges increased due to a  50 million railroad maintenance expense that had a corresponding exact benefit in tax expense  partially offset by improved foreign hedging results in our intercompany funding  For 2020  corporate unallocated should be approximately  800 million  with the increase from 2019 due to investments in IT  1ADM business transformation  R D and innovation  transfers from the business segments into corporate to centralize key activities  the return to normal incentive compensation accruals  offset by the full year impact of savings from our workforce restructuring  Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than last year  benefiting from lower short term interest rates and proactive management of the debt portfolio despite overall higher debt levels to fund the Neovia acquisition  For 2020  we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be slightly below 2019  Corporate results also included a  0 24 per share loss on the sale of our interest in CIP comprised of a pre tax loss of  101 million and the  32 million tax expense It should be noted that we received pre tax proceeds of  210 million in December from the sale from an original investment of  38 million made in 1988  You can see more data and background on the transaction in the Additional Facts and Information section of this slide deck  In addition  in corporate  there were noncash early retirement and global workforce restructuring charges of about  0 01 a share and a  0 04 per share LIFO charge  Next  I ll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter  Please turn to slide seven  Ag Services and Oilseeds results were higher versus the fourth quarter of 2018  Ag Services results were slightly lower year over year  In North America  the delayed U S  harvest contributed to lower export volumes  driving lower margins  In South America  results benefited from improved margins driven by good export demand and farmer selling In crushing  results were lower year over year  Overall  margins were solid though lower than the extremely high levels in the year ago period when global margins were being supported by the very short soybean crop in Argentina  Strength in the vegetable oil market contributed to a very good canola crush margin environment in North America  Year over year results were impacted by negative timing effects this quarter versus positive timing impacts in the prior year quarter  Refined products and other results were substantially higher  The impact of the passage of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit for 2018 and 2019  which contributed  270 million net to segment operating profit  was a major driver  However  even absent the tax credit  RPO delivered its best Q4 and  in fact  its best full year in recent history We continue to see strong global demand for both biodiesel and food oils  In addition  the Algar Agro acquisition in Brazil contributed positively to results  Wilmar results were slightly higher year over year with its diversified business model performing well even with the backdrop of African swine fever impacting feed demand in China  Looking ahead  we expect overall Ag Services and Oilseeds results to be lower in Q1 2020 than Q1 2019  Ag Services results should be in line with the year over year period  Crushing will be strong but still lower due to the very high crush margins  driven in part by positive timing impacts in the year ago period  RP O should be slightly higher on continued good oil demand  We expect the impacts of the biodiesel tax credit to continue to support the biodiesel industry  although the normalized impact for ADM in 2020 will be lower For preliminary modeling purposes  we assume about 1 6 of the combined 2018 to 2019 impact  but the actual net benefit will be a function of market conditions as we move through the year  Additionally  we expect to see the ramp up of agricultural exports to China in the second half of the year  Slide eight  please  Carbohydrate Solutions results were lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 and similar to the third quarter of 2019  Starches and Sweeteners results were up year over year  Improvements in manufacturing costs  including at our Decatur corn complex  helped support strong results as did higher income from corn coproducts in North America  In EMEA  we began to see some improvements in margin conditions  but results were lower year over year  Wheat milling results were up around globally  Bioproducts results were down compared to last year s fourth quarter due to continued unfavorable ethanol conditions and some risk management hedging losses Looking ahead  in Q1  we will begin reporting the Carbohydrate Solutions business in two subsegments  Starches and Sweeteners and Vantage Corn Processors or VCP  VCP is our newly created dry mill ethanol subsidiary  which will also market ethanol produced at our wet mills  The results of VCP will best cover the reduction of the three dry mill ethanol plants and the income from distribution of wet mill produced ethanol  The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment will include the results of all wet mill operations  including ethanol production  For the first quarter of 2020  in Starches and Sweeteners  we expect to continue to see the benefits of our improved manufacturing costs and anticipate EMEA results to be higher than the first quarter of 2019  We expect VCP to continue to be impacted by challenged industry ethanol margins  Absent any improvement in the ethanol industry margin environment for the rest of the first quarter  we will expect the Carbohydrate Solutions segment results in Q1 to be down versus Q4 2019  On slide nine  Nutrition results were substantially higher year over year  capping off a full year of 23  OP growth in the business and record results for WILD For the quarter  WFSI results were significantly higher than the prior year period  with sales 8  higher on a constant currency basis and operating profits 40  higher year over year  The WILD team delivered another outstanding quarter as strong sales and margins in North America  EMEA and APAC drove positive results  In Specialty Ingredients  lower sales and margins in emulsifiers and reduced margins in edible beans were partially offset by continued margin growth in plant based proteins  Health   Wellness results were up driven largely by a new strategic agreement for fermentation capacity  We believe that our leadership position in fermentation will continue to provide benefits for ADM in the coming years as our expertise and production capability will prove extremely valuable to cutting edge companies who are looking for new sustainable ways to create a wide variety of consumer and industrial products Animal Nutrition was up substantially versus the prior year period as Neovia continued to contribute positively to results  partially offset by a continued weak pricing environment for lysine globally  2019 was an impressive year of growth for Nutrition  and we expect that growth story to continue in 2020  For the first quarter  we anticipate overall Nutrition segment results will be substantially higher than the first quarter of 2019 with growth in operating profit at around 20   WFSI should be up on the continued customer demand for our on trend ingredients and our unparalleled expertise and service  Animal Nutrition will continue to benefit from our Neovia acquisition and the execution of the synergies we ve identified  though we expect the global lysine pricing environment to remain challenged in the quarter  In addition  year over year comparisons will benefit from last fall    last year s first quarter Neovia purchase price adjustment on inventory costs  which negatively impacted results one time Now I ll turn the call back over to Juan Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Ray  Please turn to slide 10  Earlier this month  we unveiled a new corporate identity for ADM  The new identity builds on our purpose to unlock the power of nature  to enrich the quality of life and reflects our evolution as a company  I m proud of what we have accomplished in the five years since we purchased WILD both in terms of our Nutrition segment results  including our 23  year over year operating profit growth in 2019  but also in the unparalleled value proposition we offer our customers  Today  our ability to work with our customers  offering an industry leading array of products along with expertise and innovation to help them deliver unique solutions along with ADM systems  sets us apart and put us in an unequaled position to meet global consumer trends  And we re building the same capabilities in our Animal Nutrition business Only a year in  Neovia is performing above our expectations  and we remain far ahead in the timing of achieving our synergy goals  We re going to continue to deliver on that growth story and drive margin growth in that business  the same as we have done with WILD  With the momentum we have in the Human Nutrition business  the accelerating growth of our Health   Wellness business and the second year of Neovia as part of our Animal Nutrition business  we expect another year of 20  plus growth in profitability in our Nutrition segment in 2020  At the same time  we are continuing to drive results in the Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carb Solutions businesses  which are critical value creation engines for the company  These businesses have leadership positions in their respective markets  but we know we can further improve  We remain focused on capital efficiency  portfolio management and the use of technology and analytics to help drive cost and margin improvements in those segments Despite all of our accomplishments  it s important to also focus on the things that did not go as planned in our execution in 2019  Our planned improvements in the Decatur corn and amino acids complexes  although substantially complete  took longer than expected  and their overall results in 2019 were well behind their targets  Our new centralized operations center of excellence will help make sure plant improvements are implemented more effectively going forward  And despite the impressive results we have achieved with some of our recent investments  those growth projects have not reached their full potential  That is why in 2020  we re going to start to pivot our readiness focus  initially placed more on efficiencies toward harvesting our investments and driving commercial improvements and revenue growth  So as I look ahead to 2020 and beyond  I see significant opportunities  We feel that external conditions should improve in the back half of the year particularly as impacts from the Phase one agreement between the U S  and China take hold Nevertheless  we are planning conservatively and focused on driving our own results for the year  We are focused on opportunities for business improvement  including our ongoing strategic review of our dry mills and addressing lysine  We are advancing readiness  and there is still more to harvest from our recent growth initiatives  We ll be acting on all these opportunities in 2020 while remaining focused on disciplined capital allocation and M A as we continue to drive toward our 10  long term ROIC objective  With all of these factors and without taking into account the benefits of the biodiesel tax credit  we are targeting the delivery of pre tax improvements of  500 million to  600 million in 2020 compared to 2019  Looking beyond 2020  as we continue to advance our strategy  I m excited by the growth opportunities offered by evolving consumer trends and by the improvements and efficiencies we are continuing to execute across ADM With that  Jack  please open the line for questions Questions and Answers OperatorCertainly   Operator Instructions  Eric Larson with Buckingham Research  Your line is open Eric Larson    Buckingham Research    AnalystYes  Good morning  everyone  Thanks for taking my question  So I guess the first question here is when you look at  obviously  you ve    we ve had biodiesel tax credits coming back into the market  would that ultimately help your oil demand in 2020 and be more of a tailwind to your crush margins for the year Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we are very positive about oil demand into the year  We ve seen demand outpacing capacity or production for most of the eight oils  We ve seen  Eric  biodiesel  not only the support of the tax credit in North America but also biodiesel mandates going up around the world  We are also seeing good demand for food oils  And we re seeing a decline in the production of palm oil due to weather and fertilizer application  So that has been tightening the market  So we ve seen oil prices coming up  And also remember that we had a small rapeseed crop in Europe  so that s also tightened a little bit the balances  So I think that the oil story will support crush going into 2020 is our view Eric Larson    Buckingham Research    AnalystYes  And then just a little more flavor  I ve been anticipating with the Phase one trade deal that it would be a gradual increase throughout the year  But it seems to me that the setup for the fourth quarter when we re in harvest this year  and hopefully  we have much better conditions and a much better environment to operate in  it seems like the fourth quarter setup could really be quite good because that s when our    we re most competitive on global pricing  Is that thought process in sync with how you would look at that Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  The way we have estimated it for ourselves is back end loaded  so the exports to China coming in the second half of the year  So yes  we expect at the time that we have all the pressure in the system  this export could come  and that could improve margin by that point  yes  in the Q4 of 2020  yes Eric Larson    Buckingham Research    AnalystOkay  thank you  I ll get back in queue Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Eric OperatorBen Bienvenu with Stephens Inc  Your line is open Ben Bienvenu    Stephens Inc     AnalystHi  thanks  Good morning  everyone Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerMorning  Ben Ben Bienvenu    Stephens Inc     AnalystI want to ask  starting on crush and in Argentina in particular  I know you guys don t have crushing operations there  but that s a pretty dynamic market  obviously experiencing significant financial distress  And there are a number of crushers that are experiencing acute financial distress  I d just be curious to hear how you guys think Argentina is setting up for 2020  And could that ultimately be a market where crush is constricted and helps to support a global crush environment across the other geographies Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thank you  Ben  Listen  as you said  Argentina starts 2020 with a number of challenges that are historically economic  They need to tackle the  100 billion debt  higher levels of poverty inflation  and the government has very little room to maneuver  So they have implemented all the export taxes  And as such  the farmer has taken a very defensive position  So the farmer is at this point in time  they sold a lot of grain in anticipation of export taxes  And today  as an Argentine  you cannot buy dollars to hedge against your devaluation  So basically  you need to hold to the grain  So I think that the farmer will focus on financial management and cash flow management during the year So they sold a lot in anticipation of the export taxes  and they re going to be a reluctant seller for the rest of the year  So you re going to see and we re seeing right now the impact of that of Argentina being less of exporter of meal  We ve seen the U S  meal going into Europe recently  whether it s Spain or Germany  also going to Philippines  So U S  meal being the most competitive feed for places where there are nontraditional export markets for the U S  So yes  we see this  if it were to continue  to be supportive of crush margins in North America and Europe for that market Ben Bienvenu    Stephens Inc     AnalystGreat  And then I d like to switch gears to the Starches and Sweeteners business  You talked about some improvement in coproduct values that you ve seen  I d be curious to hear kind of your outlook in the backdrop of the potential for U S  China trade improving  that being supportive of coproduct values  And then also  if you could provide any commentary on how the contracting season fared for 2020 and kind of what our expectations should be looking out to this year for pricing on the sweeteners basket Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerBen  on the coproduct values  a lot of it has been driven by the demand for vegetable oil  So corn oil values have gone up  And so that s really supported our overall coproducts from that business  As we kind of think through the rest of the year  we do believe that with the contracts completed  we ll be able to maintain the margins that we had through the negotiations  Our overall Starches and Sweetener performance  improvements will be directly resulted by things that we can control  So the recovery of Decatur  some of the improvements that we re doing over in EMEA  there is recovery in sugar prices over in Europe as well  so a lot of those factors will help drive improvements in our Starches and Sweetener business in 2020 compared to 2019 Ben Bienvenu    Stephens Inc     AnalystThanks so much OperatorTom Simonitsch with JPMorgan  Your line is open Tom Simonitsch    JPMorgan    AnalystGood morning  everyone Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Tom Tom Simonitsch    JPMorgan    AnalystSo you mentioned the benefits of Phase one will be back end loaded this year  But can you just give us some more detail as to actually how the agreement has altered your outlook for regional soy crush margins and U S  exports of soybeans and ethanol  And if you can layer in your latest assumptions around ASF  that would be helpful Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  When we look at oilseeds  in general  crush margins  I would say  from an Oilseeds and Ag Services perspective  as I explained to Eric before  we think that the exports will be back end loaded  So from an export elevation margins  if you will  that s where we think it s going to happen  From a crush perspective  we are positive in general to crush  Demand has been very good for the    so far  and I would estimate rates for meal are in the range of 3  to 4  for the U S  So we feel good about that  As I mentioned  we ve seen record weekly soybean meal exports recently to Spain  Germany and the Philippines  and that will be supportive of crush margins here in the U S  So we think that meal basis will remain strong  And even if all these China purchases come  we should be able to offset that potential basis gain for soybeans Europe  we have seen soy margins have firmed in recent weeks  And they are in the  30 to  40 per metric ton  so a little bit on the Argentine not being that aggressive into Europe  And of course  rape margins are under pressure since we have a small rape crop there  When we see China  margins have been steady  around  30   35 per tonne  Crush has been robust  Meal demand actually has been surprisingly resilient there and mostly on more feed into hogs but also in poultry and aquaculture that requires a lot of soybean meal  I will say  if I go to Brazil  we have very good margins in Brazil  These are the best margins we ve seen in quite some time in Brazil mostly due to all the exports that they re going to China  So with ASF  we ve seen all those slaughterhouses exporting a lot to China  So that keeps a very robust demand there in Brazil  We have seen margins dropping in Paraguay to maybe    crush margin to maybe  20 mostly because we ve seen Argentine crushers going to Paraguay to procure beans So that has been the biggest  if you will  negative impact that this Argentine situation we have had in crush margins  So that s how I see the world right now  With respect to ASF  we think that probably the worst is a little bit behind us in maybe 2019  The scenario developed a little bit as we predicted or as the experts predicted in which we saw that protein gap of maybe 20 million tonnes being filled mostly with imports and we re seeing Brazil being very aggressive filling up those imports  and we see the crush margins impact of that  We ve seen also China reacting to that with more chicken and aquaculture  and we see the crush margins there as well  We think that we re going to see the impact of U S  exporting as well now with the Phase one because although U S  exports grew  it was still relatively small given that there were still import tariffs in place  So we see a progressive shift in the industry in China toward more professionalized farming in that regard and that use more soybean meal  So we see that as a positive  But we expect also for imports to continue our more elevated rates than in the past even in a    on a long term basis  So we expect the recovery toward 2021 and 2022 becoming normal  but the new normal will be slightly different Tom Simonitsch    JPMorgan    AnalystThat s very helpful  And if we could just switch to U S  corn exports  the USDA is forecasting 2019   20 exports down 14   but shipments are running down 53  to date  When do you expect the U S  corn exports to turn a corner  And maybe you can just discuss the factors that have contributed to the weakness up to this point  We re hearing there have been some quality issues for this year s corn crop in the U S  And if that is true  how is that impacting ADM more broadly Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I would say with respect to the corn question on when we are becoming more competitive is right now  Right now  we re becoming more competitive  and I think that for the next two or three months window  the corn is    the U S  corn is the most competitive in the world  So you re going to see those exports pick up right now  With regards to quality  yes  there are quality issues with this late crop  and we re working through that  Quality is an issue  not yet a huge issue  but this is an issue that at one point in time  will    could start driving farmers selling basically to get those products out of the bayou  So yes Tom Simonitsch    JPMorgan    AnalystThanks very much  I ll pass it on OperatorKen Zaslow with Bank of Montreal  Your line is open Ken Zaslow    Bank of Montreal    AnalystHi  good morning  guys Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerMorning Ken Ken Zaslow    Bank of Montreal    AnalystI just want to touch base on the  500 million to  600 million improvement  How much of that improvement in tax is actually either harvesting investments or savings coming down to the bottom line Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I would say that the    if you remember how we build this kind of algorithm  this kind of math  we were going to have    we had in 2019 about  125 million of very unusual weather events  We normally have weather events  but this was one in 40 years kind of event  So we re counting  125 million hopefully with more normalized weather we will not have  Then we have all these leakages that we were fixing Decatur  we were fixing lysine  we were fixing Golden Peanut  And some of those leakages  we didn t complete  as I said before  on time  And some of them have an overspill  and we have an opportunity to get an extra maybe  50 million or a little bit north of  50 million in terms of leakages  Then we have the interventions that we made last year  the restructuring  There was about  200 million of potential savings  so we capture only  80 million last year  so  120 million are coming in full fruition in 2020  Then we have the readiness that s going to contribute  give or take  another  250 million like they contributed this year  something between  200 million and  300 million  Just take  250 million to make it easy And then we have the harvesting of some of the investments that we made  And that originally  we have said something around  100 million to  150 million  It s probably going to be a little bit higher than that since we under performed a little bit on that in 2019  So those kind of the algorithms  So that s why we feel comfortable  Ken  because these are things that we have invested already for  We just need to bring them to the P L  Readiness is a pipeline of projects that we have identified  It s not that we need to come up with those projects  We just need to execute into that  The interventions  I mean  these are things that we normally transition into  And the leakages are well controlled  The Decatur plant has the highest corn grind in two years in December  Our wheat milling has been having great yields also in the Q4  Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts is working well  So we feel good about our algorithm  I would say Ken Zaslow    Bank of Montreal    AnalystSo you re not really actually incorporating a material improvement in actually underlying fundamentals  It s more internal    of the  500 million to  600 million  the majority of that is still internal operating improvements  And if you were to get improvements in the trade exports from China    imports from China or exports to China for ethanol or corn or basis  all that stuff  that s not as much included in the numbers  Is that a fair assessment Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerThat is correct  When we plan and when we describe this number  this is all things that we can control  If we have a benefit from expansion of margins on a Phase one deal because of exports or other things  that will be on top of this  We have planned some exports  of course  a part of the deal  but we didn t plan a significant expansion of margin  We ve done the  500 million to  600 million on all the things that we can control as if the scenario wouldn t change Ken Zaslow    Bank of Montreal    AnalystMy last question  If I do the math also and I do the 20 plus percent on the WFSI and Nutrition business of the growth that s associated with it  obviously  it s overindexing of the  500 million to  600 million relative to what the business represents as part of your core  What are the longer term plans for that business  Is that a business that should be part of ADM  Is that a business that should be separated  How do you think of that as part of your portfolio  And how does it work within the portfolio  Or can it be a stand alone to extract the incremental valuation  Can you talk to that Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  yes  We are very excited  of course  about the Nutrition business  If you think about the Nutrition business evolution  Ken  and I think that    I talked about the evolution because it s important in terms of the linkage with ADM  if you will  This is a business that started from having specialty proteins out of oilseeds and a lot of fibers and emulsifiers and other products out of the corn  So these are businesses that are tied to that  and they created the Nutrition business  And then of course  we added WILD Flavors for Human Nutrition  and Human Nutrition is growing nicely  Then we added Neovia to complete our Animal Nutrition business  and that s growing very  very well  And now we are very excited about two development areas that we have  One is the Health   Wellness area with all the microbiome  and that s very synergistic with all the other stuff That s very synergistic with Human Nutrition  That s very synergistic with Animal Nutrition as well  But we have a lot of opportunities there with    and running clinical trials  And we    you saw the acquisition of Biopolis  the acquisition of Protexin  the acquisition now of Yerbalatina Phytoactives in the area of botanicals  So that s an area that is going to receive a lot of attention and a lot of resources to grow  And then we have the incipient area of fermentation that Ray described before  which is all these companies that are looking for sustainable materials  We are a fermentation company  We have a lot of capabilities  not only technical but also asset wise  And that s an area that continues to grow  If you notice  Health   Wellness have grown 44   and I think that it s still a small base  but you will continue to see So not only we have a vibrant and growing Nutrition business  but we have the roots of maybe the next Nutrition business with us  So at this point in time  we continue to invest in that  We think that they re going to become a higher percentage of ADM operating profit  And hopefully  valuation will reflect that at the proper time  If we see that growth is not reflected in valuation  we will look at how to unlock that value  There are no sacred cows  and you know us  Ken  And we re going to be very focused on unleashing that value  But at this point in time  we feel that the integration works well  We feel that the different business models don t conflict to each other  and they are very synergistic at this point  So we feel good about it Ken Zaslow    Bank of Montreal    AnalystGreat  I really appreciate it  Thank you Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorMichael Piken with Cleveland Research  Your line is open Michael Piken    Cleveland Research    AnalystYes  Hi  I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper in terms of the Sweetener and Starches  I know you said    you mentioned you re going to hold    you re hoping to hold the margin  But maybe you could provide us any sort of update on how the high fructose corn syrup negotiations have gone Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLike we mentioned  I mean they re completed  And I think in general  we will be able to maintain the margins that we had last year from a gross margin perspective  which  by the way  are healthy  right  I mean we ve been able to sustain that over the past couple of years  Really  driving the improvements really is to    the things that we can control  And as Juan indicated  we did have leakages in the Decatur corn complex  It took us a while in order to kind of get the complex to be running at the rate that we want to  We got it done at the end of the year  but frankly  we thought we could get it done sooner in the year  So that s going to be a positive delta for us in the Starches and Sweeteners segment  We had weather issues  as you know  earlier in the year  The high water conditions which shut down some of our corn plants  we re hoping that doesn t repeat itself  That should be a positive delta also in terms of our Starches and Sweeteners segment  And then we ve had some issues over in EMEA  over in Europe  whether it be at our Chamtor facility or over at our Central European facilities  We ve had an improvement in terms of market conditions as we moved to the back part of the year  And so hopefully  that will continue  That should present a positive delta also in terms of our Starches and Sweeteners segment  So again  on things that we can control or some of the factors over in Europe  those are all positive tailwinds for our Starches and Sweetener business in 2020 Michael Piken    Cleveland Research    AnalystOkay  Great  And then I know it s a little bit early to tell  but with the coronavirus spreading throughout China  I mean what impact or potential impact could that have on your business  And I guess more specifically  I guess  if you could break it out a little bit between your Ag Services and maybe kind of the potential Wilmar business and whatever  but just trying to understand how this might have any impact on your business would be helpful Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So Mike  of course  our hearts go out to those that have been impacted by the virus  and we are monitoring the situation and the safety of our employees very closely  Actually  ADM have donated  150 000 to the China Red Cross to help their efforts to contain the virus  At this point in time  the impact to us in ADM is very difficult to assess  So early on  we have about 1 100 employees in China  but our direct profits in China are small  Of course  our exposure is through Wilmar  Wilmar have two locations in Wuhan  And of course  they are currently shut down because of Chinese New Year  and then we will wait for the authorities to see how those operations will come back  Shanghai is shut down until February 9  We know that no employees from Wilmar have been infected  And of course  since Wilmar was going to shut down for Lunar New Year  they had inventory of products  So for normal demand  we can    they will be able to supply  We don t know exactly what s happening with distribution at this point in time within China since information is relatively scarce So at this point in time  Wilmar issued a press release saying that we don t expect any significant impact to their businesses  So of course  probably people going out  that type of entertainment and dining  will be reduced  So some of the bulk products  maybe bulk consumer products  could be impacted in demand  but people will have to eat inside anyway  So in that sense  more the packaged goods will probably pick up a little bit  So at this point in time  we don t expect a significant impact in our business  How could that impact ADM in general  We are in a very fundamental business  which is the business of food  So I think that we will be impacted to the extent that GDP  the global GDP will be impacted for  And that will depend on the magnitude of that  And hopefully  the very high alert and the very high response of the Chinese government will contain this  So we    again  we are trying to make everything possible  even contributing funds  to help with the containment of this virus Michael Piken    Cleveland Research    AnalystThank you OperatorHeather Jones with Heather Jones Research  Your line is open Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystGood morning  Thanks for taking the question  My first question is just as a clarification on two points  First  Ray  did you say that A O operating income is anticipated to be flat for the full year in  20 versus  19  Or were you referring to some subsegment of A O Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou re referring to Ag Services and Oilseeds Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystAg Services and    yes Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I was referring to basically   Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystDid you say    did you have some kind of full year   Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  no  we didn t provide any full year on Ag Services and Oilseeds  We were saying that basically  looking at    for Q1  overall  Ag Services and Oilseeds should be lower  But Ag Services  so the Ag Services part of Ag Services and Oilseeds  should be in line with the year over year Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystFor Q1 Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerFor Q1  All this is Q1  correct Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystYes  OK  And your    another clarification  On your  500 million to  600 million for the year  you re not including the benefit from the BTC in that Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  we re not  That s right  I mean all that is excluding biodiesel tax credit impacts  So the year over year comparison does not have the BTC in  18 and doesn t have the BTC in  20  Just to make it an easy comparison for you Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystOkay  Good  And then my other question is in Argentina  So thank you for the new slides in the slide deck  They re very helpful  Was a little confused by the Argentina numbers  You re actually showing them a little lower than they were in    at the time of you all s call for Q3  And everything we re seeing and reading and then the dynamics there with Vicentin and all  it s all pointing to higher  So I m just wondering if there s something I m missing or if you could just help us understand that Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So as you know  we re not crushers there  So    but everything we see at this point points to those nearby margins of about maybe single digit margins  Of course  if you look at the April or when you have the harvest  you re going to    you see more  10 to  15 maybe per tonne  but that s on paper right now because right now  the farmer is not selling the new crop  So we re seeing some people crushing unpriced beans  And as I said  we ve seen crushers going all the way to Paraguay to get the beans  So that s not an inexpensive way to supply yourself  So that s what creating the compression  to be honest  But that s all we know at this point in time  Heather Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystBut is it your anticipation that given the export taxes you mentioned earlier  these issues with Vicentin and all  is it your thought expectation that Argentina will crush less this year  Or would you expect    or how are you thinking about their full year activity Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think that Argentina maybe will crush the same amount  but I think it will be difficult to convince the farmer to give away the beans  As I said  as an Argentine  you can    the only way to protect yourself from inflation and devaluation is to be in dollars  and you cannot buy more than  200 today  So if you sell your crop  you cannot buy dollars  So people are holding to the crop because the crop preserves the value in dollars  So unless the government does something different and changes the conditions that they are today  today  the farmer will be a hoarder of their grain for the rest of the year  So my point is you will have to pay up so    because the farmer will only sell it when the price are impossible to ignore  So that s kind of my view at this point in time  But things are very dynamic  Heather  I mean it s so difficult to project a year in Argentina  So I would say that s the situation right now  In    by the end of March  Argentina concludes or supposed to conclude the negotiation with the IMF in their restructuring of the debt  That will be a very important time to assess the year for Argentina because then you re going to know what could be done from a government perspective  At this point in time  there s very little room to maneuver  and it s very difficult to predict in a highly political environment Heather Jones    Heather Jones Research    AnalystOkay  thank you so much for the color Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome Heather OperatorRobert Moskow with Credit Suisse  Your line is open Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerMorning Robert Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    AnalystGood morning Juan  I think you said that China took in about 20 million metric tons of soybean meal  I couldn t tell if that was all from Brazil or a lot from Brazil  As the U S  becomes a bigger part of the export market after Phase 1  do you think it s kind of a zero sum game where Brazil exports less  Or do you think that  overall  China is just going to have to export or import more based on the timing of the herd rebuilding  And then I have a follow up Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Let me clarify  Rob  I didn t mention that the U S  send soybean meal to China  I said two things  I said that the U S  has been exporting meal to nontraditional destinations like Spain and Germany and Philippines  And then I said that the soybean meal demand in China has been resilient because of feeding more pigs and actually poultry growth and aquaculture growth there  So sorry if I confused you with all those things  Regarding shifting between Brazil and Argentina    or Brazil and the U S   listen  I do believe that China intends to comply with the Phase one conditions of the deal  So in that sense  that has to come at the expense of Brazilian exports  So I think to a certain degree  it s going to be a zero sum game in which Brazil will export less if the U S  will export more to China Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  Okay  I ll get back in queue  Thank you OperatorSteven Haynes with Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Steven Haynes    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  guys  Thanks for taking my question  I think SG A on a GAAP basis was up close to  100 million  Are there any kind of onetime items in there  Or is that just the year over year comparison issue with Neovia being in the results now  Yes  so how should we be thinking about the SG A kind of on an underlying basis is what I m getting at Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  you re exactly right  And when you think about comparison looking at GAAP SG A on a year over year basis  there s been    actually  the acquisitions that we made  Neovia  FCC  Ziegler  basically  their SG A costs actually come into the 2019 GAAP statement  So that accounts for the majority of the increase that we ve seen in SG A  We ve also had some investments in  19  the business transformation  And then that s partially offset by the savings that we ve had regarding our workforce restructuring  The other thing just to note is in SG A  when we start bringing in more of the Nutrition business into ADM  naturally  the SG A will go up because there s an S component associated with Nutrition on SG A  So as our business mix continues to move toward more Nutrition  you will see a little bit more on the SG A line  and that s primarily driven by the S part of it Steven Haynes    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Thanks OperatorAdam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Adam Samuelson    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  good morning  I was hoping  Juan  Ray  if we could talk a little bit about on the corn side  just where we are on the strategic review of Vantage and just help think about kind of the process there and what you see as the pathway to maybe separating that business over time and just    and time line there Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So Adam  I think the team has done a good job on creating the wholly owned subsidiary  VCP  that was launched on December 1 as a subsegment of Carbohydrate Solutions  I said it publicly  and we still are discussing with a few parties  I can characterize those discussions in an advanced stage  So hopefully  we will get to a resolution on that  We have a couple of alternatives of different type of deals that we re looking at  In the meantime  we think that some things have clarified itself since the last time we talked or at least present a little bit of a better medium term perspective for this business  Of course  ethanol is included in the Phase one agreement with China  So that s encouraging news  We have seen recently the court s issue on the SREs waivers  And that s a positive that spike RINs  The day that  that happens is    sets a good precedent  And we have seen also sugar prices come up over 20  since September  which is another important thing  As you know that ethanol competes with sugar in Brazil for the production of that  So I think some encouraging signs for the medium term  And there are a lot of    despite the short term difficulties  there seems to be significant interest in various parties to gain scale of economies  And we have two of the largest dry mills out there  so this is very important for consolidation plays  So we re still optimistic about getting something done Adam Samuelson    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAll right  That s very helpful  And then just a quick one for Ray  On the unallocated corporate expense going up to  800 million  any way you can kind of just    some of the key pieces of that year on year increase  I think you noted you re going to take some cost out of the payments  Specifically  how much is that  And where would that be coming out  Just so we re clear on the moving pieces Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I mean basically going up by roughly  150 million  but I mean a lot of it is the business transformation whereby we re making the investments  So we are putting in the S 4HANA as investment into the company  So that s going to be a chunk of it  R D in Ventures  we continue to invest in innovation  which is very important for the company  And then centralization  As we centralize global operations  as we centralize purchasing  as we centralize some of the global business services  that s going to be a shift in cost from the business units over to the central and corporate unallocated  So those are the main components of why the number will be going up overall Adam Samuelson    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAll right  superb  I ll pass it on  thanks OperatorAnd we have time for one final question  Eric Larson with Buckingham Research  your line is open Eric Larson    Buckingham Research    AnalystOkay  thank you  everyone  Just two really quick follow ups  One  first one s for Juan  the Nutrition business  it s really kind of a follow on to Ken s question  The Nutrition business is really starting to hit full stride here  consistent with your comments that  that would happen several years ago  And I think your goal is that    or your belief is that this division can be as much as 25  of total corporate profits  So if you look at last year s number of your total segment profits  that s roughly a double from here at some point  Can you share with us your thoughts as to the cadence of how that would come over without obviously giving guidance per se  but how does that flow of earnings look for you over  let s say  the next two to three years for Nutrition Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  The objective is still there to get Nutrition to be about 25  OP  Of course  we don t want to do it by reducing the OPs of the other businesses  So that s why we focus on how much Nutrition grows year over year  As you heard Ray saying before  we grew operating profit 68  on the quarter and 23  year over year  So basically  every year  Nutrition is kind of having a quarter to the year  if you will  which is very impressive  And we plan to do it the way we build it so    all the way to now  So every now and then  we have a major acquisition like we did with the WILD Flavors in 2014 then we did Neovia in 2018  So it was four year apart  And in the meantime    in the in between  we did some bolt ons  and we did some organic growth  And we re going to do the same based on our capital allocation and our returns discipline  So we are very  very mindful of that  and we want to stick to that The time    so think about it  again  our three main thrusts  One is human nutrition  That will continue to grow aggressively more than the market  Then we have animal nutrition  That s the same with the Neovia boost and the margin improvement story there  And then we have where we re probably going to be putting more money is the area on health and wellness and the area of fermentation  Those are areas that are growing very fast  but they are still very  very tiny today  And that s where you re going to see the acceleration  But I would say the strategy will not change significantly in the sense that we re going to have some transformational deals every now and then but then bolt ons and organic growth  and that s the way we build it  We expect to get to 25   if that s the question  probably within the next three to four years Eric Larson    Buckingham Research    AnalystOkay  perfect  And then one final question  This is for Ray  Ray  you took a large asset impairment charge in the quarter  Where did that charge come in  Was it ethanol assets Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  no  There s mainly Ag Services Oilseeds assets as we kind of have    we call it    there s a term we use  precision EVA  whereby we re looking at all the assets very carefully  determining what makes sense for us to keep  sell or fix or basically dispose  And so we took some charges related to some vessels  ocean going vessels  We took some charges related to some businesses that we re going to divest  And we took some charges related to some operations  which we re going to restructure  So I view it as part of the overall precision EVA that Ag Services and Oilseeds team is working on right now Eric Larson    Buckingham Research    AnalystOkay  thanks for the clarity will talk soon Ray G  Young    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Eric Juan R  Luciano    Chairman of the Board of Directors

171066,392582,ADM,Soft Carbohydrate Unit Hurts Archer Daniels  Will It Revive ,opinion,Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   looks troubled  thanks to the persistent softness at its Carbohydrate Solutions segment  Decline in production volumes  lower ethanol margins and soft results in Starches and Sweeteners as well as Bio products are hurting the segment s performance In second quarter 2019  revenues at Carbohydrate Solutions fell 7 8  year over year mainly owing to adverse weather conditions in North America  Also  the segment s adjusted operating profit plunged 22 3  mainly due to weak Bio products results on account of negative ethanol industry margins  The persistent unfavorable weather further affected the segment s results by nearly  15 million  Moreover  margin contractions on account of low sugar prices and the Turkish quota on starch based sweeteners negatively impacted the segment s results in EMEA Going forward  management expects Archer Daniels to report weak third quarter 2019 results compared with the figure registered a year ago Meanwhile  it continues to witness a challenging ethanol margin environment  particularly the recent run up in corn prices  Consequently  Archer Daniels reported dismal second quarter 2019 results  wherein earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight time  Additionally  both the top and bottom line decreased year over year  Notably  extreme weather hurt segment operating profit by nearly  65 million in the second quarter  Moreover  Archer Daniels  top line performance was affected by revenue decline across all its segments  except Nutrition Quite apparent  shares of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company have lost 16 4  in a year  wider than the  s 15 1  decline  This downside can also be attributed to the company s unimpressive earnings surprise history  marking the third straight negative surprise in second quarter 2019 Furthermore  analysts are losing confidence in the stock  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents for the third quarter and  2 80 for 2019 witnessed a decline of 3 8  and 2 1   respectively  over the past 30 days Can Efforts Aid Turnaround While the aforesaid factors make us apprehensive  Archer Daniels  strategic endeavors including cost savings and the Readiness program appear encouraging Under the Readiness goals  the company has prioritized 275 Readiness initiatives by second quarter 2019  up from 185 in the first quarter  These completed initiatives are likely to generate run rate benefits of about  500 million on an annual basis  remaining on track to deliver nearly  1 2 billion by the end of 2020  Further  Archer Daniels estimates these initiatives to contribute about  250  300 million in accrued benefits by the end of 2019 These apart  Archer Daniels  progress on its three strategic pillars   optimize  drive and growth   is worth mentioning  Progress on the optimize pillar is reflected by the completion of significant global organizational changes  which include reductions in management layers  centralization of activities  removal of positions and the early retirement for eligible employees in the United States

improve performance at Decatur complex  management has centralized the milling management and commercial teams  and intends to combine the flour and corn milling businesses  Moreover  Archer Daniels remains committed to expand its global centers of excellence  which include key areas like technology  talent and growth Under the growth pillar  the company completed the buyout of the major European citrus flavor provider  Ziegler Group  This deal will aid Archer Daniels to become a global leader in the flourishing natural citrus ingredients space Backed by all these efforts  Archer Daniels is

171068,392584,ADM,U S  confirms light soy  wheat  pork sales to China before latest tariff threats,news,"By Karl Plume
CHICAGO  Reuters    China bought small amounts of U S  soybeans  wheat  sorghum and pork last week ahead of the latest escalation of trade tensions with Washington  according to U S  government data issued on Thursday  in what may be the last American farm commodity sales to China for the foreseeable future 
China s Ministry of Commerce said this week that purchases of U S  agricultural products by Chinese companies have been  suspended  
With Chinese buying on hold  U S  exporters will instead focus on shipping orders made earlier this year when the two sides appeared headed for a deal  a list that includes more than 4 million tonnes of soybeans and nearly 103 500 tonnes of pork 
Tensions escalated after Washington branded Beijing a currency manipulator and threatened to impose 10  tariffs on  300 billion in Chinese imports  starting on Sept  1 
 Chinese private buyers are not going to be making any U S  purchases with a government ban in place   said Dan Basse  president of AgResource Co   These are the last sales we are going to see unless there s some thawing or some movement in the U S  China trade negotiations  
China bought 60 000 tonnes of wheat  50 000 tonnes of sorghum and 1 350 tonnes of pork in the week ended Aug  1  weekly U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  data showed  The data also confirmed a new purchase of about 71 200 tonnes of soybeans 
The sales  a fraction of what China would normally buy from the United States  occurred as top officials met in Shanghai for talks aimed at restarting trade talks to end a year long trade war 
The miniscule sales are a sign of the rising intensity of a trade war that has riled markets  redrawn global supply chains and heaped economic pain on some of the world s largest companies  including grain merchants Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  and Cargill Inc  CARG UL  
Chinese tariffs on U S  soybeans have slashed exports of the most valuable U S  crop and prompted the Trump administration to compensate farmers for two years with as much as  28 billion 
The USDA report confirmed that export shipments of U S  agricultural goods have continued despite the rising tensions 
More than 8 500 tonnes of pork and 516 000 tonnes of soybeans were loaded and shipped to China last week  USDA data showed 




Three bulk cargo vessels are waiting to be loaded with soybeans at Pacific Northwest ports and two more are en route to be loaded  a total haul estimated at around 325 000 tonnes  according to private shipping data seen by Reuters ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-confirms-light-soy-wheat-pork-sales-to-china-before-latest-tariff-threats-1949950,1949950

171070,392586,ADM,As trade war drags on  new Bunge CEO looks to avoid  stroke of the pen  risk,news,"By Karl Plume
CHICAGO  Reuters    A year removed from a losing bet that the U S  China trade war would be promptly resolved  global grains trader  Bunge  Ltd  N BG  is facing an even more uncertain business environment  with a new chief executive who is determined not to get burned again 
Gregory Heckman  who joined Bunge s board late last year and took on the CEO role in January  told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday improving risk management at the 200 year old company is a key focus as he oversees a portfolio review that is expected to last through the middle of 2020 
As the trade war enters its second year with no sign of a resolution  White Plains  New York based Bunge and other grain traders are also navigating weather reduced crops in the United States  a herd culling hog disease in China that has slashed demand for soybeans and currency gyrations that have fueled uncertainty in top soymeal exporter Argentina and elsewhere 
Bunge s surprise loss in last year s second quarter  when bets on a quick trade war resolution turned sour  and another loss triggering bet in the fourth quarter as trade tensions eased is something Heckman is determined to avoid 
 We want to avoid any surprises from stroke of the pen risk   Heckman said  referring to unforeseen risks such as abrupt government policy shifts or tweets by U S  President Donald Trump 
Investors last year pointed to a culture at Bunge where traders took on more risk compared with rival trading houses as contributing to the loss 
 While we have to make certain decisions to manage the inherent risks and protect the margins in our crushing and our distribution and milling assets  we try to absolutely stay out of the way of any big changes that can happen   Heckman said 
The company is improving coordination between its risk management and commercial teams and doing more scenario analysis to make sure that any bets are appropriately weighed against earnings prospects  he said 
Grain merchants like Bunge and rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM   Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co  known as the ABCD quartet of global grain trading giants  have already been restructuring their businesses and cutting costs after a years long crop supply glut that thinned margins and sapped profits 
Heckman joined Bunge s board as part of a deal to ease activist investor pressure on the company following a string of weak results that made it vulnerable to takeover attempts by ADM and global commodities trader  Glencore  Plc  L GLEN  
Heckman  a founding partner of private investment firm Flatwater Partners and the former CEO of grains trader Gavilon Group  declined to comment on whether the company was currently in takeover talks 
Rising market uncertainty has stiffened near term earnings headwinds for Bunge since it reported better than expected second quarter earnings last month  Heckman said 
Bunge left its full year 2019 earnings guidance unchanged when it announced second quarter results on July 31  but warned that uncertainty from African swine fever and the trade war meant more of the profit for the second half of 2019 would come in the fourth quarter 
 We thought that our  second half 2019  earnings would be largely weighted to Q4  It s probably even more so now   Heckman said 
Bunge is looking to streamline the company s operations and maximize profit as part of its ongoing portfolio optimization program  It unveiled a new global operating model in May and announced last week that its headquarters would move to St  Louis from White Plains  New York 
The effort has also found a new home for Bunge s sugar business  long a drag on earnings  in a Brazilian bioenergy joint venture with  BP  Plc  L BP  
The company is actively working on  a number of other projects  that will be announced as they are completed  Heckman said  He declined to elaborate on which businesses would be impacted 
 We ve given ourselves an internal deadline to have the majority of the portfolio transformation and optimization work completed by the end of Q2 2020   he said ",2019-08-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/as-trade-war-drags-on-new-bunge-ceo-looks-to-avoid-strokeofthepen-risk-1959617,1959617
171071,392587,ADM,Big Ag wants a cut of booming fake meat market,news,"By Rod Nickel and Tom Polansek
WINNIPEG  Manitoba CHICAGO  Reuters     Bunge  Ltd  one the world s biggest grain traders  recently disclosed the 1 6  stake it had purchased in the fast growing fake meat startup Beyond Meat 
The play looked smart after the stock surged more than 250  since the faux burger and sausage maker s initial public offering in May  Indeed  Beyond Meat s  O BYND  market capitalization of  9 9 billion is now larger than Bunge s  N BG   a 201 year old firm with 31 000 employees 
No wonder many top agricultural firms want to grab their cut of the booming market for plant based fake meat  Bunge s investment is just one example of how grain traders and seed companies are trying to capitalize on a market that now accounts for 5  of U S  meat purchases   a share expected to triple over a decade  according to investment management firm Bernstein  That growth would mirror the fast ramp up of milk substitutes made from crops such as almonds 
 I definitely think this is going to continue to drive demand   said Vince Macciocchi  president of the nutrition group at Archer Daniels Midland  N ADM   one of Bunge s chief rivals 
ADM and privately held grain trader Cargill are selling processed peas and soy proteins to consumer food companies and restaurants that use them to make vegetable burgers  sausages  fish substitutes and other faux meat products  They are also getting into the business through acquisitions and corporate partnerships or by leveraging their labs and research capabilities to help make new plant based products for clients including food and beverage makers 
Seed company  Corteva   N CTVA    which spun off in June after a merger of  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  and Dupont  N DD    is studying potential vegetable seed offerings 
Grain traders and seed makers are following the lead of Beyond Meat and another startup  Impossible Foods  along with traditional meat producers such as  Tyson Foods   N TSN  and Maple Leaf Foods  TO MFI  that have cashed in on plant based meat substitutes  Demand for meat alternatives has soared as consumers add plant based protein to their diets for health reasons and out of concern for animal welfare and environmental damage from livestock farming 
Tofu  made from soybean milk  is the best known meat alternative and has been around for decades  But in recent years  other crops such as black beans  peas  lentils  canola  beets and sunflower have become popular in products made to taste like or replace meat 
The big agricultural firms are in part playing defense  Grain traders supply the world s livestock farms with animal feed   a business that would suffer if fake meat sales rise at the expense of real meat  Seed companies such as  Bayer AG   DE BAYGn  sell to farmers who grow the corn and soybeans that are now sold mostly to feed livestock 
SURGING DEMAND
ADM this year created a new position   director of  flexitarian  solutions   to focus on developing products for food companies who are targeting the market for a mostly plant based diet  Macciocchi said  The company is also considering repurposing an animal feed plant in Rotterdam to produce human grade soy products  he said  ADM has expanded its plant protein team of scientists and marketers in the past three years even as it aims to cut its overall workforce 
 We ve dedicated a significant amount of our team   the technical side of our team  as well as the commercial side of our team   to plant based proteins   Macciocchi said 
Cargill  CARG UL  in August announced an additional  75 million investment in North American pea protein producer Puris   which supplies Beyond Meat  That triples its original  25 million investment in January 2018 
Cargill s customers have been clamoring for pea or soy protein products  including alternative meats  said Laurie Koenig  who leads a Cargill unit developing such items 
 We ve never seen this kind of pull before from the market   Koenig said 
Like ADM and Cargill  Bunge is now looking to supply ingredients to startups and large companies involved in the imitation meat trend  Bunge CEO Greg Heckman said in an interview 
 There s just so many ways that it is touching our business   he said 
SEEDS OF A NEW MARKET
Seed developer Corteva has discussed expanding into research or small acquisitions in vegetable seeds in part to take advantage of increasing demand for plant based proteins  Chief Executive Jim Collins told Reuters  Corteva s ability to research breeding and genetics of corn and soybean crops could be applied to vegetables  he said 
 The whole vegetable seed industry is interesting to me   Collins said 
Rival Bayer also could enter the market as a provider of plant based meat alternatives  an executive said in August  without providing details  The company  which sells seeds and farm chemicals  said it also offers products for plant based protein sources such as soybeans  tree nuts and peas 
Toronto based pork processor Maple Leaf two years ago bought U S  based Lightlife Foods  a plant based burger maker  to expand its reach into a market with boundless potential  chief executive Michael McCain said  While the trend is starting in North America and Europe  it will expand worldwide within a decade  McCain said

171072,392588,ADM,Exclusive  Ships with one million tonnes of grain stuck outside Iran s ports in payment crisis,news,"By Jonathan Saul and Parisa Hafezi
LONDON DUBAI  Reuters    More than 20 ships carrying around one million tonnes of grain are stuck outside Iranian ports as U S  sanctions create payment problems and hamper the country s efforts to import vital commodities  sources directly involved in the trade said 
Trading companies such as  Bunge   N BG  and China s COFCO International have been hit by payment delays and additional costs of up to  15 000 a day as the renewed U S  restrictions stifle the processing of transactions  trade sources said 
Food  medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions Washington re imposed after U S  President Donald Trump said he was walking away from a 2015 international deal over Iran s nuclear program 
But the U S  measures targeting everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities have deterred several foreign banks from doing any Iranian business  including humanitarian deals such as food shipments 
The few remaining lenders still processing Iranian business face multiple hurdles to facilitate payments as financing channels freeze up 
Six Western and Iranian sources said the situation was contributing to the cargoes being held up for more than a month outside Iran s biggest ports for goods  Bandar Imam Khomeini and Bandar Abbas 
The ships are carrying cargoes including soybeans and corn mostly from South America  the sources said  The grain vessels are also visible through ship tracking data 
 There are no restrictions on humanitarian business  but you can t get paid for it   one European source said   You can be waiting for months to get a payment  
Another source said   There is nervousness among traders about making more sales to Iran before the backlog  of ships  is cleared  
A senior Iranian port official  who declined to be named  told Reuters there had been problems since U S  sanctions were imposed on its financial system in November 2018 
 What has changed is that now the number of banks  traders that are staying away from doing business with Iran is increasing   the official said 
Separate U S  sanctions imposed in September on Iran s central bank   following attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia that U S  officials blamed on Tehran   have added to difficulties with transactions 
The Iranian port official said these latest sanctions would scare away banks 
 Some small banks that we used to work with have informed us that they will no longer do business with us   he added  declining to name the banks 
An official with Iran s agriculture ministry said separately that Tehran had since the 1980s aimed to ensure the country had sufficient stocks of grain 
 We have increased the amount of stockpiles because of Trump s policy towards Iran and tensions in the past months   the official said   It is becoming more and more difficult because of the sanctions  
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization  FAO  estimated last month that Iran s total cereal stocks in 2019 would total 5 1 million tonnes  falling to 4 8 million tonnes in 2020  versus 9 9 million tonnes in 2016

Trade sources said Iranian ports were also struggling to process ships due to a lack of available berths 
Of the vessels still anchored  at least 20 dry bulk ships were waiting outside Bandar Imam Khomeini  Refinitiv data showed  A further two vessels had managed to discharge their cargoes after waiting for weeks  the data showed 
Separate data from shipping intelligence platform MarineTraffic showed a similar number of ships stationary for more than a month 
A separate Iranian government official confirmed that ships were waiting but declined to give details 
Trade sources said Turkey s Halkbank  IS HALKB    one of the main banks that Iran has relied on for such humanitarian trade   had not been able to process payments fast enough because of the complexity of the process and in some cases did not complete transactions with suppliers  Halkbank declined to comment 
Suppliers have been left with additional costs  known as demurrage  of up to  15 000 a day as they wait to unload 
Trade sources said U S  agribusiness group Bunge and China s COFCO International were among the companies affected  together with smaller Turkish and Iranian suppliers 
COFCO International declined comment 
Bunge spokesman Frank Mantero said   While we don t comment on or confirm commercial contracts  Bunge exports agricultural commodities in accordance with all applicable legislative frameworks  
Two sources said the increasing difficulties had prompted U S  agribusiness company ADM  N ADM  to halt trading with Iran since August  An ADM spokeswoman declined to comment 
Trade sources told Reuters in December that Bunge and rival U S  group Cargill  CARGIL UL  as well as other suppliers had halted new food supply deals to Iran due to payment issues 
Cargill  CARGIL UL  said in a statement   In certain countries where international sanctions exist  we provide that food using the humanitarian exception for medicine and food  
A U S  Treasury spokesperson said Washington designated Iran s central bank under its counter terrorism authorities  adding that the broad exceptions to the sanctions such as for humanitarian trade that once applied to transactions involving the central bank no longer applied 
The spokesperson also said the department continued to encourage the private sector and foreign counterparts to provide humanitarian assistance  if the transactions were conducted with Iranian financial institutions or entities that have not been blacklisted by Washington ",2019-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-ships-with-one-million-tonnes-of-grain-stuck-outside-irans-ports-in-payment-crisis-1990972,1990972
171093,392609,ADM,Archer Daniels  ADM  Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates  Down Y Y,opinion,"Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   reported disappointing first quarter 2019 results  wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter and also declined year over year Adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share decreased 32 4  from the year ago quarter and lagged the consensus mark of 62 cents  On a reported basis  the company s earnings came in at 41 cents per share  down from 70 cents earned in the prior year quarter Archer Daniels Midland Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Management stated that adverse winter weather conditions in North America have negatively impacted the company s operations in the first quarter  A weak ethanol industry environment remained an added headwind Q1 DetailsRevenues in the quarter under review totaled  15 304 million  which dipped 1 4  year over year but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 702 million  Revenue decline across all the segments of the company  except Nutrition  was the primary reason behind the downside Going by segments  quarterly revenues at the Origination  Oilseeds  Carbohydrate Solutions and Other segments fell 2 3   3 4   7 6  and 23 6  to  6 124 million   5 414 million   2 403 million and  81 million  respectively  Conversely  at Nutrition revenues improved 34 9  to  1 282 million Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of  608 million in first quarter 2019  down 15 2  from the year ago quarter  On a GAAP basis  the company s segment operating profit fell 13 2  year over year to  611 million On a segmental adjusted basis  adjusted operating profit at the Oilseeds segment dipped 2 3  year over year to  341 million owing to soft results at Refining  Packaging  Biodiesel and Other  Also  lower Wilmar results in Asia hurt the segment  However  Crushing and Origination results were impressive driven by higher crush margins and favorable timing effects  Nevertheless  this was somewhat offset by fall in Chinese demand on South American origination and impact of slow farmer selling Adjusted operating profit at the Origination segment amounted to  76 million  up 65 2  from the year ago quarter  This upside was mainly due to robust Merchandising and Handling  and Transportation results on a year over year basis  Moreover  effective execution drove margins in North American grain as well as solid performance in structured trade finance and reversal of some timing impacts from the previous quarter aided the segment s performance  However  this was offset by soft global trade performance  which was affected by normalized South American soybean and soybean meal margins versus year ago period At the Nutrition segment  adjusted operating profit decreased 15 6  to  81 million as robust WFSI results were offset by weak performance at Animal Nutrition  In fact  WFSI registered 21  growth in profit across its all three businesses  Also  WILD Flavors remained sturdy and sales grew 11  at constant currency  Higher product mix is an added positive  However  the Neovia buyout that concluded in January led to higher up front costs associated with inventory revaluation and hurt results at Animal Nutrition  Notably  lysine production and yields have been improving from production disruptions in the third quarter of 2018  This  in turn  is likely to accomplish normalized yields by second quarter end The Carbohydrate Solutions segment s adjusted operating profit plunged 54 9  to  96 million  The downside can mainly be attributed to soft Bioproducts results along with lower ethanol margins in a challenging industry landscape  Also  production volumes were hurt by unfavorable weather  Starches and Sweeteners were also impacted by weak European sweetener industry volumes and margins as well as escalated manufacturing expenses at the Decatur complex and lower margins in flour milling FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  926 million  long term debt including current maturities of  8 289 million and shareholders  equity of  18 910

171095,392611,ADM,Paraguay economy to grow under 3  this year  finance minister says,news,"By Daniela Desantis
ASUNCION  Reuters    Paraguay s finance minister told Reuters economic growth in 2019 was likely to come in below 3  from an earlier projected 3 2  percent thanks mainly to weak soybean production caused by poor weather in the first half of the year 
Benigno L pez said Paraguay  the world s fourth biggest exporter of soybeans  had weathered the worst of the  storm  
 The hit in the first half is behind us and the economy is going to recover   Lopez  the half brother of conservative President Mario Abdo and one of his main advisers  said in an interview at his offices in central Asuncion 
 We will end up with moderate growth  but growth at last  
The country s central bank  which previously estimated growth of 3 2   is expected to revise the formal number this month  according to the bank s calendar 
The soybean crop in 2018 2019 was 20  lower than the year before due to the adverse weather  official data show  Lopez said the government was providing financing tools to make sure planting targets can be met in the next crop season beginning in September 
The hit to soybeans was compounded by a drop in hydroelectric energy production and beef output  as well as the global uncertainty caused by trade tensions between the United States and China  Lopez said 
China is the world s biggest soybean importer and the United States is the second largest exporter 
Some business sectors criticize Lopez for pushing tax reforms which will force soybean processors to contribute some  60 million a year more to the treasury  among other things 
The crushing industry  controlled by international grains giants such as  Bunge  Ltd  N BG   Louis Dreyfus Company and Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM   argues the reform will discourage investment 
The minister defended the reform as a necessary  rebalancing   however 




The additional  60 million in taxes  corresponds to everything they benefit from in terms of production   Lopez said   Paraguay will continue to be a country open to investment  ",2019-07-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/paraguay-economy-to-grow-under-3-this-year-finance-minister-says-1924139,1924139

It has attracted interest from some of the world s largest agribusiness firms  including Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  and  Bunge  Ltd  N BG  
Still  Saudi Grains Organization  SAGO  in its statement on Sunday did not name successful pre qualified bidders from the first phase of the process last year 
Privatization of the flour milling sector is seen as a litmus test for other large state asset sales to follow 
Large grain market players  interest in SAGO s mills comes as Saudi Arabia grows increasingly dependent on grain imports  The kingdom has become a major importer of wheat and barley since abandoning plans in 2008 to become self sufficient   as farming in the desert was draining scarce water supplies

higher biodiesel volumes and margins with impressive results from food oils drove the performance  Robust Wilmar results in Asia too aided growth However  adjusted operating profit at the Origination segment amounted to  183 million  down 29 9  from the year ago quarter  This downside was mainly due to lower Merchandising and Handling results on a year over year basis  comprising important

171118,392634,ADM,Is China buying U S  soy  Washington shutdown keeps traders guessing,news,"By Julie Ingwersen CHICAGO  Reuters    Commodity traders are in the dark because of the partial U S  government shutdown  unable to see daily and weekly reports of agricultural exports to obtain clues as to whether China is following through with promises to buy grain and soy amid the ongoing trade war  Traders have been anxiously awaiting proof from the U S  Department of Agriculture that China is ramping up purchases of grains and soy from U S  farmers  who are preparing their spring planting and trying to secure financing for seeds  fertilizer and land rents  Now  trade experts and grain analysts warn the suspension of the reports is clouding the marketplace and potentially giving an advantage to big grain companies directly involved in the export trade  The government shut down partially at midnight on Dec  21   We re watching sales to China like a hawk   said Ted Seifried  vice president and chief ag market strategist for the Zaner Group  Beijing resumed buying U S  cargoes earlier this month  after the two countries agreed on Dec  1 to a trade war truce  But hefty tariffs on U S  cargoes remain in place  and there is uncertainty over how much the top U S  soybean customer will purchase   The gap also gives the large commercial grain merchants   such as Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM    Bunge  Ltd  N BG   Cargill Inc  CARG UL  and Louis Dreyfus Corp  LOUDR UL    an advantage by allowing them to keep their export deals with countries like China and Mexico out of the public marketplace  ADM and Cargill said on Friday they had no comment  The other two companies could not immediately be reached for comment  Rich Feltes  vice president for research with Chicago based brokerage R J  O Brien  said the absence of USDA export sales data can increase the risk involved in trading agricultural markets  pushing speculators to the side   It gives a little bit of unfair advantage to exporters who either are or are not making sales  and can trade that information accordingly   he said  Along with its weekly export sales reports  the USDA has issued daily announcements of grain and soybean sales over 100 000 tonnes since 1977  The reporting system was launched in response to the purchase of millions of tonnes of U S  grain by the Soviet Union in 1972 in deals that resulted in soaring U S  grain and food prices FARMERS AT RISK University of Illinois agricultural economist Scott Irwin said the partial shutdown could also deal a blow to farmers suffering from the U S  China dispute  by delaying aid payments meant to help offset some of the losses for crops hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs in a trade war launched by U S  President Donald Trump   If you re talking about cash in the farmer s pocket  the longer this goes on  the longer it s going to delay that program  which is really just getting ramped up   Irwin said   The shutdown entered its seventh day on Friday  and was on track to continue into next week and possibly longer  It affects about 800 000 employees of the Departments of Homeland Security  Justice  Agriculture  Commerce  and other agencies  If the shutdown persists  it also could jeopardize the release of a host of hotly anticipated monthly and quarterly grain supply and demand reports   The USDA on Friday reiterated that the shutdown  if it continues  would halt its World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates  WASDE  report and reports by its National Agricultural Statistics Service  which tracks quarterly U S  grain stocks and U S  winter wheat seedings  Those reports  along with an annual summary of U S  crop production  were scheduled for release on Jan  11  In the reports  Feltes said analysts expected to see the USDA trim its estimates of the average 2018 U S  corn and soybean yields  imply strong feed usage of corn in the first quarter  and shed light on how many acres of winter wheat farmers were able to plant this past autumn  given excessive rains in many areas

171173,392689,ADM,6 Stocks To Prepare For A Global Economic Slowdown  ,opinion,"On Jan 21  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  reduced its global economic forecasts for this year and the next  A slowdown in Europe and certain emerging markets  and the ongoing trade conflicts were cited as the major reasons for these cuts  The global lending agency also thinks a slowdown in China and a likely  No Deal  Brexit are the other factors causing a reduction in its projections 
The IMF s fears were echoed by fresh official data released by China s government  The world s second largest economy expanded at its slowest pace in 28 years in 2018  likely an outcome of the U S  China trade war 
With a global economic slowdown looking imminent  it makes sense to fortify your portfolio for such conditions  In such an event  demand for products and services generated by utilities  consumer staples and medical companies remain invariant  Investing in stocks from these sectors looks like a smart option 
IMF Reduces Global Forecasts for 2019 and 2020
The IMF has revised its global forecasts for 2019 and 2020 to 3 5  and 3 6   respectively  These are 0 2  and 0 1  lower for respectively 2019 and 2020 than the projections released earlier in October  That this is the second such cut in three months is a cause for great concern  The IMF had made the last such reduction in October  citing the ongoing U S  China trade war as a major issue 
The latest cuts also acquire special significance since they were released ahead of the annual World Economic Forum  which began on Monday at Davos  Switzerland  Global policy leaders will now possibly have to discuss ways and means to cope with an end to an extended period of stable growth 
According to IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde   After two years of solid expansion  the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising   Lagarde has urged policymakers to prepare themselves for a  serious slowdown  by improving their economies  ability to handle such risks 

China s Economic Growth Slumps in 2018
Adding to global slowdown fears was the latest growth data released by China s government  per which its economy expanded at 6 6  last year  This is the most sluggish pace experienced since 1990  Such a slump was in line with most analysts  expectations  given that it is engaged in a protracted trade war with the United States 
And on Monday  Ning Jizhe  who heads China s statistics bureau more or less confirmed such speculation  Speaking to reports  Ning said the trade war with the United States is weighing on the country s economy  Of course  Ning also added that the resulting impact was manageable and the economy was being fueled by domestic demand 
A more plausible explanation is that China was facing an impending slowdown even before the trade war began in earnest  For some time now  Beijing has been trying to reduce surging debt levels without affecting growth significantly  China had prepared itself for a slower pace of expansion in any case  but the trade war has intensified its problems

171177,392693,ADM,Exclusive  U S  sorghum armada U turns at sea after China tariffs,news,By Karl Plume and P J  Huffstutter CHICAGO  Reuters    Several ships carrying cargoes of sorghum from the United States to China have changed course since Beijing slapped hefty anti dumping deposits on U S  imports of the grain  trade sources and a Reuters analysis of export and shipping data showed  Sorghum is a niche animal feed and a tiny slice of the billions of dollars in exports at stake in the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies  which threatens to disrupt the flow of everything from steel to electronics  The supply chain pain felt by sorghum suppliers on the Pacific  Atlantic and Indian oceans underscores how quickly the mounting trade tensions between the U S  and China can impact the global agricultural sector  which has been reeling from low commodity prices amid a global grains glut  Twenty ships carrying over 1 2 million tonnes of U S  sorghum are on the water  according to export inspections data from the USDA s Federal Grain Inspection Service  Of the armada  valued at more than  216 million  at least five changed course within hours of China s announcing tariffs on U S  sorghum imports on Tuesday  Reuters shipping data showed    Graphic    The five shipments  all headed for China when they were loaded at Texas Gulf Coast export terminals owned by grain merchants Cargill Inc  CARG UL  or Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  would be liable for a hefty deposit to be paid on their value  which could make the loads unprofitable to deliver   Beijing  which is probing U S  imports for damage to its domestic industry  announced Tuesday that grains handlers would have to put up a deposit of 178 6 percent of the value of the shipments  Traders said Cargill and ADM likely sold most of the grain in the cargoes that are on the water  traders said  In a statement to Reuters on Thursday  Cargill confirmed it is the exporter  The company declined to confirm what is in the ships  the final destinations or the tonnage  nor name the customers  The company also declined to confirm why the ships stopped  or if they are being re directed   but said that it does not have any responsibility for costs that may result  ADM representatives declined to comment  The Panamanian flagged ship called the N Bonanza  was churning its way northeast across the Indian Ocean earlier this week  carrying more than 67 000 tonnes of sorghum from ADM s elevator in Corpus Christi  Texas  according to Reuters shipping data  Eleven hours after the anti dumping deposits were announced  the ship stopped and then slowly tracked northwest  The RB Eden  a vessel carrying 70 223 tonnes of sorghum loaded at the same ADM terminal  was headed east northeast through the Indian Ocean off the coast of South Africa  It turned around  Hours later  the Stamford Eagle   hauling sorghum from Cargill s elevator in Houston   turned around off the western coast of Mexico  At least two other vessels have also suddenly changed course  the Ocean Belt and Xing Xi Hai  both loaded at Cargill s terminal  It is unclear where the vessels are now heading   For now  at least  two of the world s largest grain merchants are among those feeling the impact of the latest trade tussle with China  even if it is just a short term issue  said Bill Densmore  senior director of corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings   For their overall trade businesses  this is not that substantial  But it s a warning   Densmore said   If China really does start slapping tariffs on everything  like soybeans and corn  things could get really ugly  really fast   SEARCHING FOR NEW BUYERS Beijing s move has heaped more strain on an already tense trade relationship between the world s two largest economies  Traders said the deposit was high enough to bring U S  imports to a halt  Sorghum is used in livestock feed and the fiery Chinese liquor baijiu  Indeed  the news had an immediate impact on the global grains market  Bids for cargoes of Australian sorghum  which are not subject to the higher tariffs  spiked following the announcement  traders said  Industry sources in China said some of the cargoes might be redirected to Southeast Asian countries  such as Vietnam and the Philippines  to feed hog and poultry plants owned by Chinese feed producers  However  those countries and others in the region are small importers of sorghum  Vietnam has never imported U S  sorghum and the Philippines imported just 19 000 tonnes in the 2016 17 season  according to USDA data  China  by contrast  imported more than 5 2 million tonnes last season  nearly 10 times more than No  2 importer Japan  the data showed   Shippers may have to discount the cargoes to sell them  analysts said   They re not in a strong bargaining position considering they ve got shipments from across the ocean that they have to sell and get the boats cleared out   said economist Daniel O Brien of Kansas State University in the top U S  sorghum producing state  Sorghum prices at the Texas Gulf have slipped since China s announcement  At midweek  immediate shipments from Corpus Christi  were priced around  181 29 per ton  not including shipping costs  a one month low  The U S  sorghum industry called for an end to the trade dispute and expressed concern about the impact on established trade relationships that have taken years to build   This tit for tat has to stop  and talks to find reasonable and lasting solutions must begin  for the good of U S  agriculture and the customers we have spent decades working to win as loyal buyers   said Tom Sleight  president and CEO of the U S  Grains Council

171181,392697,ADM,Big Ag turns to peas to meet soaring global protein demand,news,By Rod Nickel and P J  Huffstutter  Reuters    Cargill  the global grains trader  sees the future of protein in the humble pea  In a joint venture at a Wisconsin plant  flour milled from Iowa yellow peas is mixed with water and spun at high speed through stainless steel drums  separating the protein from starch and fiber   The resulting powder ends up blended into waffle mixes  sports drinks  nutrition bars and protein shakes   small examples of a much larger push by the world s biggest agriculture firms to find alternative plant based proteins to feed people and livestock worldwide   When we looked at where is the future going  the pea is the up and coming thing   said David Henstrom  Cargill Inc s vice president of starches  sweeteners and texturizers  Peas are in many ways the ideal modern American food  protein rich  plant based and gluten free  While the market remains relatively small  the demand for pea powder and other emerging protein sources is soaring  from the middle classes in China and the health conscious in California to livestock producers and fish farmers who need to fatten animals on ever tighter budgets  Cargill and its competitors   such as Archer Daniels Midland  N ADM  and Richardson International  the biggest Canadian grain handler   are investing in specialty ingredients in search of higher profit margins than they can extract from bigger commodity crops such as soybeans  corn and wheat    For a graphic on rising global protein consumption and demand for peas  see     Cargill invested an undisclosed sum in January in a joint venture with PURIS  a family run company that started in Iowa as a seed company and now owns the Wisconsin pea powder plant  The two firms are also working to boost the protein content in peas through cross breeding  which has not been previously reported  Cargill rival ADM is building its own pea processing plant in North Dakota and signing contracts with farmers to buy and grow yellow peas  Ken Campbell  ADM s president of specialty ingredients  said in a statement to Reuters  Company researchers are also studying another 30 types of protein options  including nuts and seeds  Other firms are trying draw more protein from canola  oats and many other so called emerging proteins  and Cargill has explored insect based feed for fish and poultry  Seed and chemical firm DowDuPont Inc  N DWDP  told Reuters it plans to launch a canola seed supercharged with protein through traditional cross breeding as soon as next year  Richardson International started construction in April of a C 30 million   23 million  laboratory in Winnipeg to study proteins and other food ingredients  The firm is exploring a move into pea and oat protein concentrates that could start next year  senior vice president of technology Chuck Cohen said in an interview  France based food ingredient company Roquette is building plant in Manitoba to produce pea proteins in North America  which currently imports from Europe  SOARING DEMAND Projections for soaring sales from alternative plant proteins have enticed large grain traders that make money by buying  selling  storing  shipping and trading crops  Years of oversupplied grain markets and thin margins have squeezed the trading operations of ADM   Bunge  Ltd  N BG   Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Co   known collectively as the  ABCDs    although conditions have improved recently  Global demand for protein   whether from meat  aquaculture or plant sources   is booming in part due to rising incomes in emerging markets in Asia and Africa  industry analysts say  In North America  consumers are shifting their diet preferences to include more protein  and 35 percent of U S  households last year said they follow a specific protein focused diet  such as Paleo or low carbohydrate  according to research conducted by Nielsen  The trend is driving a shift in grocery shopping  In the year ended July 8  2017  sales of plant based food and beverages in the U S  increased 14 7 percent over the previous period  according to Nielsen  Sales of meat alternatives are growing especially within prepared foods  an indication that consumers are trying options once only available in niche stores  Global pea protein sales amounted to  73 4 million in 2016  according to research firm Grand View Research  but are forecast to quadruple by 2025  reaching  313 5 million in sales  helped by popular diets free of gluten and lactose and an expanding middle class in developing nations  Even with such explosive growth  pea proteins would have high potential upside because they would account for a fraction of the projected  48 77 billion global animal and plant protein ingredients market by 2025  which is led by meat  according to Grand View   POWERING UP THE PEA Cargill s partnership with PURIS includes breeding pea crops for higher protein content  Standard peas contain 18 to 22 percent protein  but PURIS this year will start selling peas packed with 28 percent protein for planting by farmers in the northern Plains and Midwest  said PURIS president Tyler Lorenzen  Once processed  pea powders can contain about 80 percent protein  Creating new varieties of protein packed peas  however  can take seven years or more because it is done through conventional breeding rather than genetic modification  Lorenzen said  The lack of genetic modification  however  also attracts many consumers who prefer more organic foods  said Pascal Leroy  head of Roquette s pea and new protein business line  In Canada  one of the world s biggest pea exporters  at least three pea protein plants are planned or increasing production  including Verdient Foods in Saskatchewan  whose investors include Titanic director James Cameron  That gives farmers an incentive to vary plantings that are now dominated by wheat and canola  Roquette is building what it says will be the world s biggest pea plant in Manitoba  on the belief the vegetable has unique consumer appeal  German company Canadian Protein Innovation plans a plant in Moose Jaw  Saskatchewan  Illinois based ADM told Reuters it is building a new pea protein processing plant at the site of one of its soybean processing complexes in Enderlin  North Dakota  The location gives the company proximity to yellow pea producers and transportation to domestic and international customers  according to ADM s Campbell  ADM will launch its line of pea powders as an ingredient for food manufacturers early next year and introduce other plant based protein product lines in the following two years  the company said  declining to give further details   Unlike Cargill  ADM is seeking to boost pea protein levels in the processing plant   rather than through crop breeding   and is buying most of its supplies from nearby North Dakota farmers  the company said  ADM officials declined to detail how it can boost protein in a factory  citing competitive concerns ,2018-05-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-ag-turns-to-peas-to-meet-soaring-global-protein-demand-1453345,1453345

171213,392729,ADM,White House pushes for more talks after  no deal  on biofuels,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump has asked for more talks between representatives of the oil and corn industries after a meeting on Tuesday failed to yield an agreement on how to help refiners cope with the country s biofuels policy  Trump has called the talks between Big Corn and Big Oil amid rising concern in the White House over the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS   a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn based ethanol into their fuel  The decade old policy was intended to help farmers and reduce U S  petroleum imports but has increasingly divided farmers and energy companies   two of Trump s most important constituencies  A refining company in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania last month blamed the RFS for its bankruptcy  The meeting on Tuesday included Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania   both from major oil refining states   along with Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst of major corn grower state Iowa   No deal made   said Grassley in a Twitter post after the meeting  adding the proposals discussed were  not  win win   and would  destroy ethanol demand   Cruz issued a statement saying the meeting was  positive and productive  and added that Trump had requested another session this week   After that meeting  I believe we are likely to arrive upon a win win solution   Cruz said   White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed the Tuesday meeting on biofuels and said   We re going to continue having conversations    Under the RFS  refiners must cover the costs of blending increasing volumes of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation s gasoline and diesel each year  To prove compliance with the program  they have to acquire credits called RINs  either by earning them through blending or by buying them  As biofuels volume quotas have increased over the years  so have prices for the credits  That has been good news for companies that blend the fuels  but refiners that do not have blending facilities are facing rising costs  Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc  PES    which employs more than 1 000 people in the Philadelphia area  filed for bankruptcy protection last month and blamed the regulation for its demise   Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy  including the withdrawal of more than  590 million in dividend style payments from the company by its investor owners  Sources told Reuters the PES would have a representative at the next White House meeting  likely on Thursday  Ernst and Grassley have both said they disagree with critics who say RINs are harmful to refiners  underscoring the fact that the two sides cannot even agree on the facts  let alone the solutions  They point out other refiners  such as  Valero Energy  Corp  N VLO  and Marathon Petroleum Corp  N MPC   are pulling in solid profits despite the biofuels regulation  America s biggest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  and POET LLC   HANDFUL OF OPTIONS At least four options aimed at reducing the cost of RINs were up for consideration  two sources familiar with the agenda of the White House meeting said  One was to count U S  ethanol exports toward annual biofuels volume mandates  something not currently permitted under the policy  Another was to place a hard cap on the price of a RIN  and a third was to limit RIN trades to blenders and refiners   essentially to remove market speculation  the sources said  To sweeten the deal for the corn industry  any deal would have likely included a waiver to allow gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol to be sold year round  Sales of high ethanol blends are currently restricted during the summer due to concerns over smog  Discussions could also look at solutions focused more directly on refiner PES  like waiving its current RIN obligation valued at about  350 million  the sources said  But such a move would likely draw a backlash from other refiners who have no hope of receiving such a waiver  
While the White House meetings have focused on fixes that could be implemented with executive or regulatory action  there is a separate legislative effort to alter the RFS  led by Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas  But it too faces stiff resistance from corn states ",2018-02-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-to-consider-biofuels-policy-tweaks-at-tuesday-meeting-sources-1313797,1313797
171214,392730,ADM,Bunge s coveted Argentina plants lure ADM takeover approach,news,"By Hugh Bronstein and P J  Huffstutter
ROSARIO  Argentina CHICAGO  Reuters    On the banks of the Parana River  machines hum 24 hours a day in Argentina s grain ports  churning out soy based animal feed and shooting it straight into the hulls of ships bound for buyers worldwide 
The wind stirs up fine meal dust  creating a protein filled haze  Rosario is the biggest soy crushing hub in the Americas  where 22 plants process 157 500 tonnes of soybeans per day into soyoil and feed that fattens livestock in markets from the United Kingdom to Indonesia 
These plants are a key reason why top U S  grains merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  is attempting a takeover of longtime rival and soy crushing powerhouse  Bunge  Ltd  N BG   industry executives  analysts and grains trading sources told Reuters  The deal  estimated at  16 billion  would be the biggest ever by one of the world s four agricultural trading giants 
ADM and Bunge are the  A  and  B  of the so called  ABCD  group of firms that dominate global grains trading  along with Cargill and Dreyfus 
ADM s advance on the financially faltering Bunge reflects larger profit pressures across the grains sector amid a global glut now entering its fifth year  holding commodity prices at sustained multi year lows  Such conditions are widely expected to drive a wave of consolidation among agricultural firms 
ADM is the only one of the ABCDs that has no crushing capacity in Argentina  where Bunge has four plants 
 Where is the value in Bunge from ADM s point of view  It is in South America  including crushing and elevator capacity in Argentina   said a Buenos Aires market source with knowledge of the situation 
ADM would also take on Bunge assets in Brazil  which include factories  mills  silos  distribution centers and port terminals  Bunge is bigger than ADM in Brazil as well as in Argentina 
Juan Luciano  the Argentina born CEO of U S  based ADM  told investors this month that ADM aims  to plug holes in our value chain   although he made no reference to reports the firm has approached Bunge 
 The hole in their value chain is called Argentina  because ADM hasn t any crushing facilities here   said Buenos Aires based August Remijsen  former Southern Cone chief executive of trading group Toepfer  which was recently absorbed by ADM   The most efficient crushers in the world are located in Argentina  
Representatives of ADM and Bunge declined to comment on the reported merger talks  Bunge last year turned down overtures from Switzerland based  Glencore   L GLEN  
Argentina is the world s top exporter of soymeal and soyoil  used for cooking and making biodiesel  Most is shipped from Rosario  located in the Pampas farm belt 
The nation s massive soy crushers and grains elevators are right next to the deeply dredged Parana  The set up offers logistical advantages over the United States and Brazil  where moving grains involves more costly ground transportation and loading products on and off barges 
LOSSES MAKE BUNGE A TARGET
Bunge  founded in 1818 in the Netherlands  is the world s top industrial producer of soymeal and soyoil  But a series of quarterly losses have made the storied firm vulnerable to a takeover  analysts said 
 It s the inexorable path ahead  because it would be hard for Bunge to reverse a full year of losses   said Pablo Adreani  head of Argentine farm industry consultancy Agripac 
Argentina has launched reforms meant to attract foreign investors under business friendly President Mauricio Macri  who is lowering export taxes on soybean meal and soybean oil 
Bunge exported 11 2 percent of the 32 8 million tonnes of soymeal shipped from Argentina last year  and 7 8 percent of the 5 9 million tonnes in vegetable oils  according to agriculture ministry data 
About 60 percent of Argentine soyoil went to India and Bangladesh last year  emerging markets where ADM is keen to increase access  Soymeal was destined mainly for Vietnam  Indonesia  the United Kingdom and Italy 
ADM exported 9 1 percent of the overall 47 9 million tonnes of raw grains shipped from Argentina in 2017  close to Bunge s 9 7 percent  A combination of the two firms would be Argentina s No  1 raw grains exporter  a title currently held by COFCO Nidera  which combined early last year to capture 17 percent of the market 
Under this scenario  Dreyfus would be left in the dust with 9 5 percent of the 2017 raw grains export market 
But the ADM Bunge tie up could face regulatory scrutiny in the United States  where ADM is already the largest grain merchant  The biggest overlap between ADM and Bunge in the United States is in grain origination and oilseeds processing  and regulators could force ADM to divest substantial assets as a condition of approval  according to antitrust experts 
The firms would have to overcome opposition from U S  farmers who fear that giving more market share to ADM could hurt wheat  corn and soybean prices  said Peter Carstensen  who teaches antitrust law at the University of Wisconsin Law School 
The deal could also face opposition from farmer groups in key agricultural markets  including the European Union  China  India and Brazil  he said 
Regulators in Argentina would also have to approve any deal  A spokesman for the country s regulators declined to comment on the matter 
DREDGING CUTS THE PATH
Ocean going vessels can reach the crushing plants that dot the banks of the Parana because the river is dredged to a depth of at least 34 feet from the port of Timbues  just north of Rosario  to Buenos Aires  287 miles  462 km  to the south 
Bunge can process 18 000 tonnes of soybeans at its Rosario area facilities every day  according to the local grains exchange  At the current export price  that means Bunge can crush  7 3 million worth of soybeans in 24 hours 
Despite the industry s sustained bout with oversupply and low prices  the soymeal business has room to grow  said Adreani  the farm analyst  That s because a growing world population   now approaching eight billion   will continue to drive demand for meal fed beef and pork  he said 

 ADM is looking at the advantage it would have over the 15 or 20 years ahead   Adreani said   It s a smart strategy  ",2018-02-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bunges-coveted-argentina-plants-lure-adm-takeover-approach-1315971,1315971

171250,392766,ADM,Exclusive  Selling Saudi Arabia s grain mills proves a grind for investors,news,"By Maha El Dahan and Tom Arnold DUBAI  Reuters    An unwieldy sale process and onerous ownership rules are discouraging some potential investors from bidding for Saudi Arabia s state owned grain mills  sources close to the firms say  in a potential snag for the kingdom s economic reforms  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to modernize Saudi Arabia and reduce its dependence on oil  The kingdom is selling assets worth about  300 billion to fund the plan and potential foreign investors and bankers are watching the sales closely   The grain mills on sale come under the kingdom s monopoly state grain buyer the Saudi Grains Organisation  SAGO   one of the world s largest wheat and barley buyers  Archer Daniels Midland Company  N ADM  and  Bunge  Limited  N BG    two of the world s four biggest agribusiness firms   are among several international companies that have previously expressed interest in bidding for SAGO s assets   But one agribusiness giant which previously expressed an interest is now hesitating following the publication last week of preliminary sale guidelines which stipulate that the mills must remain majority Saudi owned   If that is the deal  then the answer will clearly be a  no    a source close to one of the large agribusiness firms potentially interested in bidding told Reuters  ADM and Bunge declined comment   The document with the guidelines  described as indicative criteria for investors  was posted on SAGO s website  Another Middle East based grain trader said after reading the document   It can t really be a whole hearted privatization if the Saudi partner remains in control    Prospective foreign bidders were made aware from the

would be room for negotiation on the level of Saudi ownership   HSBC declined to comment on the sale process and whether the majority ownership rule was flexible  An adviser to a consortium potentially interested in SAGO said the document suggested there was less room for negotiation than previously understood  even though it had been clear from the start the kingdom wanted to retain control of food security  The document was designed to elicit market feedback as part of a consultative approach to the privatization  a source close to the sale process said  IMPORT DEPENDENT Large grain market players  interest in SAGO s mills comes as Saudi Arabia grows increasingly dependent on grain imports  The kingdom has become a major importer of wheat and barley since abandoning plans in 2008 to become self sufficient   as farming in the desert was draining scarce water supplies  SAGO imports Saudi Arabia s entire wheat supply of about 3 5 million tonnes a year  It has said that demand for wheat is expected to grow at an annual rate of 3 2 percent to reach 4 5 million tonnes by 2025  largely due to population growth   Despite the opportunities for growth  some of the initial enthusiasm in the SAGO sale has cooled over concerns about the majority Saudi ownership rule  as well as other aspects of the sale structure  SAGO has previously said it would sell its milling operations by placing them in four specially formed corporate entities  while retaining other functions  The entities would each hold grain silos  feed factories and flour mills  Two of the sources close to potential bidders said a final decision on the process was still to be made  but they believed SAGO was leaning towards a sale of the entities one by one  rather than together  and this did not sit well with investors    The rules of engagement are still not clear  Will they make it all one sale or will they divide it in phases  We don t know yet   one of those sources said  After HSBC asked for feedback from potential bidders on the sequential sale  at least three groups voiced opposition to the plan  according to an adviser to one potential bidder   The two sources close to potential bidders said the first sale would probably set a level of pricing for the other three  which could be unfair on those bidding further down the line   No price indications for the milling operations have been given and investors say it is hard to put a precise figure on the value of the assets as SAGO has never been run for profit  The source close to the sale process said sequential sales would make the bidding process more competitive  benefiting the kingdom   PAINFULLY SLOW  Investors were also seeking clarity on how long grain subsidies would remain in place and details on non compete clauses  one of the sources close to a potential bidder said  adding that both needed to be clarified in the sale rules  HSBC has not publicly disclosed a timetable for the privatization  The source close to the sale process said the schedule for the sale would be disclosed at the  right stage   But potential investors said the process had been painfully slow so far  One said that even though no deadline had been set  they had expected the request for qualifications  which kick starts the process  to have started earlier  In a statement to Reuters  SAGO said it was continuing its efforts to be  on track without jeopardizing the quality of preparation and readiness  for the privatization  adding that the document with the indicative criteria for investors had been released earlier than originally planned  SAGO did not comment on the proposed sale terms  In addition to the big names  some regional investors have also expressed an interest in the sale  
Dubai based Al Ghurair  and a partnership between Abu Dhabi based  Agthia Group   AD AGTH  and local conglomerate Olayan Group are among others eyeing the privatization  sources told Reuters  although SAGO is said to be more interested in large global firms that have more experience and market clout ",2017-11-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-saudi-sale-of-grain-mills-hits-obstacles-894770,894770
171251,392767,ADM,ADM pursues big ag merger with grain trader Bunge  source,news,"By Tom Polansek and Rod Nickel CHICAGO CALGARY  Alberta  Reuters    Top U S  grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  has proposed a takeover of  Bunge  Ltd  N BG   according to a person familiar with the approach  which could set up a bidding war with Swiss based rival  Glencore  Plc  L GLEN   Large grain traders that make money by buying  selling  storing and shipping crops have struggled in recent years with global oversupplies  Thin margins have squeezed core commodity trading operations  including those of ADM  Bunge  Cargill Inc  CARG UL  and Louis Dreyfus Co  AKIRAU UL   which together are known as the  ABCDs  and dominate the industry  Consolidation is seen as one remedy  Glencore last year sought a tie up with Bunge in what was viewed as a start of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry  Bunge  which rebuffed an acquisition offer from Glencore last year  might not follow up on ADM s proposal  the source said  requesting anonymity because the approach is confidential  A standstill agreement prevents Glencore from making a new offer until next month  and Bunge is keeping its options open for now  the source added  White Plains  New York based Bunge operates in more than 40 countries and is Brazil s largest exporter of agricultural products  while Chicago based ADM says it has customers in 160 countries  Bunge  which has a market capitalization of  9 79 billion  closed up 11 4 percent at  77 56 on Friday  ADM has a market cap of  22 64 billion  ADM said it does not comment on  rumors or speculation   while Bunge did not respond to requests for comment  Glencore was not immediately available for comment  The Wall Street Journal first reported on ADM s interest in Bunge  STRATEGY SHIFT  Grain companies in recent years have expanded into higher margin sectors  such as food ingredients and aquaculture  to offset weak results and wild swings in their traditional business of handling crops  In 2014  ADM bought natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for about  3 billion in its biggest deal ever  The company has also expanded into handling healthy ingredients such as fruits  nuts and  ancient grains    News of the ADM bid is a bit surprising given that ADM had been indicating the company s strategic direction was more towards value added rather the traditional commodities   said Stephens Inc analyst Farha Aslam   ADM is the most U S  focused of the major grain companies and a takeover would help it grow in South America  where Bunge is a major agricultural force  ADM  which dates back to 1902  has tried to expand its international operations  in part to take advantage of growing demand from China  In 2013  Australia rejected its attempted  2 55 billion takeover of Sydney based grain handler GrainCorp Ltd  AX GNC  on concerns it could reduce competition  Bunge was founded in Amsterdam 200 years ago  It moved its headquarters to South America as its operations grew in the region and relocated to New York ahead of an initial public offering in 2001  HURDLES LOOM Aslam estimated that fair value for Bunge in a takeover would be  90 to  95 per share  but Morningstar said the price could exceed  100   Any tie up would probably face stiff scrutiny from regulators and opposition from farmers who fear handing more market control to ADM could hurt wheat  corn and soybean prices  The biggest overlap between ADM and Bunge in the United States is in grain origination and oilseeds processing  Aslam said  The companies would probably need to divest facilities in North America and also possibly in Europe  she added  Aslam raised the possibility that ADM and Glencore could partner in a bid for Bunge to split up its operations   ADM would take the more value added downstream businesses  and Glencore would own the more ag commodity businesses   she said  FARMERS  WORRIES An ADM Bunge merger would also face opposition from farmer groups in key agricultural markets  including the United States  European Union  China  India and Brazil  said Erik Gordon  a professor at the University of Michigan s Ross School of Business  The companies  relatively late move into the big agriculture merger game  behind DowDuPont  N DWDP   Nutrien Ltd  TO NTR  and others  would make gaining regulators  approval even tougher  Gordon said   When you re the first one  there s still more competition   he said   Once they ve let a few through  they may have second thoughts    Grain farmers need five or six active buyers to get fair prices for their goods  but there are already only a handful  said Peter Carstensen  who teaches law at the University of Wisconsin at Madison    This is the kind of transaction that will screw farmers   he said   Illinois farmer Dan Henebry  who delivers corn and soybeans to ADM s North American headquarters in Decatur  Illinois  said he was worried a takeover of Bunge could lead grain handlers to pay farmers less for their crops  
 We ve had so many mergers   Henebry said   Less competition is not good  ",2018-01-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/archer-daniels-has-made-takeover-approach-to-bunge-wsj-1127744,1127744
171252,392768,ADM,ADM approach to Bunge marks potential U turn on oilseed strategy,news,"By Tom Polansek CHICAGO  Reuters    Archer Daniels Midland Co s  N ADM  proposed takeover of  Bunge  Ltd  N BG  could signal a change in the company s strategy on oilseeds  giving the top U S  grain merchant a much bigger capacity to crush soy just months after ADM s chief executive said the firm would cut spending on the sector  The potential strategic change comes as the world s biggest agricultural merchants search for new ways to offset four years of bumper harvests that are hurting their ability to make money through the traditional channels of buying  selling and shipping crops  Consolidation is seen as one remedy  and ADM has proposed a takeover of Bunge  one of the world s top oilseed processors  a source said on Friday  ADM and Bunge have declined to comment on the takeover approach   Both companies crush soybeans to make vegetable oil and livestock feed for customers around the world  including meat producers  Just three months ago  though  ADM chief Juan Luciano said the company would reduce capital spending on oilseed crushing and increase spending on higher margin businesses  such as food ingredients   in support of the growth portion of our strategic plan   The company placed its biggest bet on that strategy in 2014 when it acquired natural flavorings company Wild Flavors for about  3 billion   A merger would differ from the value added push that ADM described as its strategy when it bought Wild Flavors    Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  analyst Robert Moskow said   That said  this represents a golden opportunity for ADM to grow its oilseeds division and improve its long term competitiveness   Especially valuable to ADM could be the chance to expand oilseed operations in Brazil  the world s biggest soy exporter  traders said  Bunge controls 27 percent of the oilseed crush market there  while ADM has 10 percent  according to data from Credit Suisse   JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan also said Bunge s processing capacity outside of the United States would likely be considered  prize assets  for ADM  ADM and Bunge shares rose 4 4 percent and 5 9 percent  respectively  on Monday  Bunge had rebuffed an acquisition offer from  Glencore  Plc  L GLEN  last year  but Heather Jones  analyst for Vertical Group  placed the odds of a Bunge takeover above 50 percent after ADM s approach   She said a bigger bet by ADM on oilseeds could pay off as that market grows over time   presenting a simpler path to improved returns than a lengthy strategic overhaul  
 Arguably the most bullish longer term theme in the agribusiness sector is global vegetable protein demand   she said ",2018-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/adm-approach-to-bunge-marks-potential-uturn-on-oilseed-strategy-1136654,1136654
171253,392769,ADM,Battle of the beans  Monsanto faces a fight for soy market,news,By Rod Nickel and Tom Polansek WINNIPEG  Manitoba CHICAGO  Reuters     Monsanto  Co  N MON  is facing major threats to its historic dominance of seed and herbicide technology for the  40 billion U S  soybean market  Rivals BASF SE  DE BASFn  and DowDuPont  N DWDP  are preparing to push their own varieties of genetically modified soybeans  At stake is control over seed supply for the next generation of farmers producing the most valuable U S  agricultural export  The market has opened up as Monsanto s Roundup Ready line of seeds   engineered to tolerate the weed killer glyphosate   has lost effectiveness as weeds develop their own tolerance to the chemical  Compounding the firm s troubles is a national scandal over crop damage linked to its new soybean and herbicide pairing   Roundup Ready 2 Xtend seeds  engineered to resist the chemical dicamba  The newly competitive sector has sown confusion across the U S  farm belt  particularly among smaller firms that produce and sell seeds with technology licensed from the agrichemical giants  Many of these sellers told Reuters they are amassing a surplus of seeds with engineered traits from multiple developers   at substantial extra cost   because they can only guess which product farmers will buy   Our job is to meet our customers  needs  and we don t know what those are going to be   said Carl Peterson  president of Peterson Farms Seed near Fargo  North Dakota   I don t think I ve ever seen anything quite like this   Monsanto has much to lose  Soybeans are the key ingredient in feed used to fatten the world s cattle  pigs  chickens and fish   Net sales of Monsanto s soybean seeds and traits totaled almost  2 7 billion in fiscal 2017  or about a fifth of its total net sales  Gross profits from soybean products climbed 35 percent over 2016  beating 15 percent growth of its bigger corn seed franchise  The firm faces multiple lawsuits  along with regulatory restrictions in some U S  states  because dicamba has drifted onto neighboring farms and fields and damaged crops not genetically modified to resist it  For a graphic on weeds  growing resistance to farming herbicides  click  For a map on Monsanto s crop damage crisis  click  BASF and DowDuPont  however  have their own obstacles to overcome  fueling unprecedented uncertainty among farmers over which seeds they will plant on an estimated 90 million acres of U S  farmland this spring  BASF is just entering the market  aiming to compete with an older soybean line called LibertyLink  which the firm is acquiring from  Bayer AG   DE BAYGn   DowDuPont is eager to join the fray but needs approval from Chinese regulators before it can broadly market and sell its new soybean product  Enlist E3  Monsanto declined comment to Reuters on competition from rivals in the soybean market  But the firm has previously acknowledged the intensifying threat to its bottom line as rivals launch new products    Our competitors  success could render our existing products less competitive  resulting in reduced sales compared to our expectations or past results   Monsanto said in an annual report filed with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission last year  DICAMBA DISASTER The name of Monsanto s new dicamba based herbicide   XtendiMax with VaporGrip   reflects the problem it tries to solve  the chemical s tendency to vaporize and drift to neighboring fields  damaging crops  But last summer  after farmers planted Monsanto s new dicamba resistant seeds en masse  the herbicide damaged an estimated 3 6 million acres of soybeans  or 4 percent of all U S  plantings  Monsanto maintains its new formulation of dicamba reduces drift effectively  It blames farmers for not following spraying instructions and for illegally applying older versions of dicamba on Xtend seeds  Despite the controversy  Xtend soybeans have sold briskly  spanning 20 million U S  acres in 2017  their second year of sales  Monsanto projects that acreage will double this year  accounting for about 44 percent of all planted acres   Still  Monsanto faces a slew of regulatory  legal and public relations challenges from the crop damage crisis  Regulators in Arkansas  where crops were heavily damaged in 2017  have prohibited the use of dicamba based herbicides between dates that likely will cover the entire growing season  Missouri  Minnesota and North Dakota have also restricted when farmers can spray dicamba   Missouri farmer Bobby Aycock joined one of several class action lawsuits against Monsanto after dicamba spraying by nearby farmers damaged his crops in 2016   He then planted Xtend in 2017 to ensure that drifting dicamba could not harm his crop again  He found another benefit at harvest time  his highest yield in 33 years of soybean farming  Despite his lawsuit against Monsanto  Aycock plans to sow Xtend seeds again this spring   If something s working   he said   I hate to change it   BASF ENTERS BEAN BATTLE BASF is waiting for Monsanto and Bayer to close their proposed  63 5 billion merger before it can take over Bayer s LibertyLink brand of seeds  which are engineered to withstand the chemical glufosinate  The timing of the takeover  expected in the spring planting season  is awkward because farmers may have already bought seeds  BASF aims to prevent any  customer disruption  when it assumes control of the LibertyLink brand as part of a  7 billion deal with Bayer  BASF vice president Scott Kay said in an interview   BASF declined to elaborate further on its strategy because the purchase of LibertyLink is not yet completed  The acquisition complements BASF s herbicide business with a seed line that should  continue to grow profitably   BASF s outgoing chief executive Kurt Bock said in October  Bayer has sold LibertyLink in the United States since 2009  steadily gaining market share to reach about 15 percent  said Rob Schrick  who runs North American corn and soy strategy for Bayer  The company expects the brand to capture 20 percent of the market in 2018  BASF had a strategic urgency in the LibertyLink acquisition  said Patrick Jahnke  portfolio manager at Deka Investments  which owns BASF stock   The Bayer seed assets were not a bargain   Jahnke said   But the purchase eliminates the risk of being the only major supplier in the agro business without a seeds offering   WILD CARD FROM DOWDUPONT DowDuPont faces the greatest obstacle in the fight for soybean market share because it is waiting for Chinese regulators to approve imports of soybeans harvested from its Enlist E3 seeds  Enlist E3 soybeans are bred to resist glyphosate  glufosinate and 2 4 D  a chemical with roots stretching to the Vietnam War as an ingredient in Agent Orange  used by the U S  military to defoliate jungle  Launching Enlist widely without Beijing s approval would risk causing unapproved seeds or soybeans to be inadvertently shipped to China  the biggest importer  So for now  DowDuPont s seeds will be grown by a limited  undisclosed number of U S  farmers who agree to deliver their harvests only to facilities run by Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM   according to the company   The deal will give Enlist   one of DowDuPont s biggest crop system investments   a toehold in the U S  market  Approval by Chinese regulators  an uncertain process  could translate to huge profits  but DowDuPont would still face the challenge of catching rivals who have a head start  said Michael Underhill  chief investment officer of Capital Innovations  which manages shares of DowDuPont  Bayer and Monsanto   To go into this market  and be late to the game  you have to be exceedingly aggressive   Underhill said  238 BILLION EXTRA SEEDS DowDuPont s entry makes it especially hard for farmers to decide what to buy because Enlist E3 may or may not be widely available  said Mark Denzler  president of Indiana based 1st Choice Seeds  which scooped up surplus soybean seeds last autumn  In Iowa  Stine Seed acquired 238 billion extra soybean seeds to sell because of the uncertainty  Chief Executive Harry Stine said  Illinois based Great Heart Seed has amassed extra supplies of five varieties of genetically modified soybeans   It s a real pain and it will continue to be so going forward  trying to manage the inventory   said company co owner Nels Kasey  Like the seed sellers  Missouri farmer Milas Mainord plans to hedge his bets by planting at least three soybean varieties  He will devote up to 30 percent of his 5 000 acres of soybeans to Monsanto s Xtend seeds to protect himself from neighbors spraying dicamba  He also plans to plant some LibertyLink and other seeds in areas where he doesn t expect dicamba use   We re covering our bases   Mainord said

article include  Archer Daniels Midland Co    NYSE ADM    Dana Inc    NYSE DAN    United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR   and Delek US Holdings  Inc    NYSE DK   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks to Snap Up After Recent Broker Rating UpgradesThe Q1 earnings season is in full swing with a deluge of companies reporting their financial numbers each day  The picture that is evolving is an extremely rosy one  According to our latest report  76 8  of the companies have reported better than expected earnings per share in the current reporting cycle Generally  an earnings beat leads to an uptick in a company s stock price  Given this highly bullish backdrop  it is natural that investors would like to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns However  with a plethora of earnings reports flooding the market during the reporting cycle  pinpointing outperformers or well performing stocks is by no means an easy task for individual investors  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   for an investor  Proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed to be experts  equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Brokers  not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents  but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio Earnings Estimate Revisions   An Useful GuideSince brokers indulge in thorough research  the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise  Therefore  the direction of estimate revisions by brokers serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates  Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy  Similarly  analysts might turn bearish and trim estimates  thereby downgrading a stock  following adverse events like lackluster earnings or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Naturally  investors would look to get rid of such stocks from their portfolio on the basis of broker advice To take into account earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the

171361,392877,ADM,Is Archer Daniels Midland  ADM  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Archer Daniels Midland has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Archer Daniels Midland s current PE ratio marginally above its midpoint  which is 17 4  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Archer Daniels Midland has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Archer Daniels Midland s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Archer Daniels Midland has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  Archer Daniels Midland is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Archer Daniels Midland currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ADM a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Archer Daniels Midland might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A  This gives ADM a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased nearly 10 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen about 4 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus    Even though Archer Daniels Midland has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineArcher Daniels Midland is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 12  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first   When it does  this stock could be a compelling value pick 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5

171364,392880,ADM,U S  agribusiness ADM to acquire Wild Flavors for  3 billion,news,"By Freya Berry and Arno Schuetze  LONDON FRANKFURT  Reuters    U S  agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland has agreed to buy Swiss German natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for 2 3 billion euros   3 billion  to enter the flavoring and the health conscious food sectors   ADM  one of the world s largest grain traders and a major food processor  said on Monday it would establish a new business unit called Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients and expected to complete the deal by the end of the year   Wild Flavors   ADM s first venture into the flavors market   specializes in natural ingredients  The acquisition  which ADM said was its biggest ever  comes as consumers have been showing increasing appetite for foods made of only natural components   The deal comes eight months after Australia rejected ADM s attempt to acquire grain handler Graincorp Ltd for A 2 8 billion   2 55 billion  because of concerns the deal was anti competitive   Illinois based ADM  which has been seeking to expand globally  will need regulatory approval from eight jurisdictions  including the European Union  to acquire Wild  Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz said on a conference call    We have been known often as a commodity business only   she said   Now that s probably a misunderstanding    Private equity group KKR   Co  which bought a 35 percent stake in Wild in 2010  has more than tripled its investment  a person familiar with the investor said   Sources told Reuters in May that ADM was among private equity and strategic bidders for Wild Flavors  which sources said expected 2014 core earnings  EBITDA  of almost 140 million euros    This was an asset with scarcity value  so we always thought there s value for a strategic player on this   said Christian Ollig  director for private equity at KKR   It was a competitive process to the end    The transaction  which includes around 100 million euros of net debt  values Wild Flavors at a hefty multiple of 16 4 times its core earnings against a peer multiple of 11  according to Thomson Reuters data  ADM is targeting 100 million euros of cost savings by the third year of the acquisition    I think it will be very difficult for them to extract value at such a high valuation   said Evgenia Molotova  an analyst at Berenberg   Wild Flavors  headquartered in Zug with management offices in Heidelberg Eppelheim  Germany  is the world s sixth biggest flavor provider  Hans Peter Wild  son of founder Rudolf Wild  owns 65 percent of the group  Wild is also the owner of a separate company that makes the drink Capri Sun but is not part of the deal   With the purchase of Wild  which is advertising a new summer fruits range on its website  ADM will obtain access to a variety of flavors  seasonings and colors derived from natural sources and used in processed foods and drinks   Wild s strong position in Europe and in the beverage sector will complement ADM s operations in North America and the food sector  Woertz told analysts   Still  Citi analyst David Driscoll said he considered ADM a bulk commodities company and  not as a science y type organization    During the conference call  Woertz referred to Wild s team of scientists and  flavorists     RECIPE FOR SUCCESS   The acquisition of Wild could be a platform for ADM to further expand its specialty business  ADM President Juan Luciano said   The flavors market is considered less volatile than commodities trading  a sector in which global weather events can send prices for crops on a roller coaster ride   Almost 30 percent of new food manufacturing product launches over the past two years have been based on the health sector  Molotova said  The sector is  very cash generative with stable earnings growth   she added

171365,392881,ADM,Cargill fires first shot in legal battle over GMO trade responsibility,news,"By Tom Polansek CHICAGO  Reuters    Cargill Inc s  CARG UL  lawsuit against Syngenta AG  VX SYNN  over rejections of genetically modified U S  corn by China may be just the start of legal challenges against global seed makers over trade with one of the world s biggest markets 
Trading giant Cargill said in court documents on Friday that it had lost more than  90 million because Syngenta sold Agrisure Viptera corn  known as MIR 162  to U S  farmers without first obtaining import approval from China  which has turned away boatloads of U S  crops containing the variety over the past year 
The lawsuit will be a test case of who is ultimately responsible for such rejections that damage international trade  the seed companies that develop unapproved GMO traits or the merchants who sell grain that may be contaminated with it 
 Let s face it  it s dollars and cents   Illinois farmer John Brink said about the motivation for seed companies that launch U S  sales without approval from all major importers 
 If they can get it out there a growing season earlier  it s more money in the pocket  more money for the company  more money for the shareholders  
Cargill filed its case as U S  farmers are preparing to harvest their first crop of another GMO variety of Syngenta corn called Duracade  which China has not approved for import 
Nearly 90 percent of corn in the United States  the world s top grains producer  is now genetically engineered  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  as farmers embrace technology that helps kill weeds and fight pests 
Approvals of the crops from importers are critical as the coming harvest is expected to be a record 14 395 billion bushels   outstripping domestic demand of 11 855 billion  which mostly goes to animal feed or ethanol production 
China is one of many countries that is cautious about GMO crops  Some consumers worry about the safety of the crops for animal and human consumption  and there are concerns over their impact on the environment  including increased resistance of weeds 
Farmers like Brink place the blame for China s rejection of U S  corn containing Viptera squarely on Syngenta  And global grain trader Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM  has said it too is considering legal action against the seed maker over the variety 
Illinois based ADM  has not yet made a formal decision on what actions it will take   spokeswoman Jackie Anderson told Reuters in an email   Wide scale planting of traits that aren t approved by key importing countries diminish the competitiveness of American grain and feed exports   she added 
Bunge Ltd  N BG   another major grain trader  did not reply to a request for comment 
Syngenta began selling corn seed containing MIR 162 to U S  farmers in 2010 after winning approval from U S  authorities  China has been considering an application to approve the variety for four years 
Cargill said in its lawsuit that approval from China for imports  typically takes two to three years   while approval for cultivation can take longer  Syngenta had applied for both 
Beijing began rejecting U S  shipments of corn containing MIR 162 in November  costing the agriculture industry up to  2 9 billion  according to the National Grain and Feed Association 
 
RECKLESS CONTAMINATION 
Cargill s claims that Syngenta recklessly contaminated the U S  grain supply by selling MIR 162 without import approval from China are baseless  Syngenta spokesman Paul Minehart said in a statement 
Syngenta  strongly upholds the right of growers to have access to approved new technologies that can increase both their productivity and their profitability   he said 
Cargill itself took a risk by agreeing to sell U S  corn to China  knowing the variety was in production  said a grain exporter for a rival company who asked not to be named 
 Any time you do business with China  there s a risk   the trader said   You try to make your trade with that in mind  
 Cargill  like any grain trading company  saw a margin and a way to make money   he added   They saw an opportunity and they went after it  
Farmers and grain merchants need to keep MIR 162 corn separate from other varieties to prevent accidental shipment to unapproved markets  MIR 162 is approved for shipment to other major buyers of U S  corn such as Japan and Mexico 
Cargill has said it asked farmers to provide advance notice when they were delivering MIR 162 corn to its grain elevators  However  MIR 162 corn can still be found throughout the U S  corn supply  effectively closing the lucrative Chinese market to U S  supplies  according to the lawsuit 
 Syngenta should have never even sold it until it was approved   said Caleb Hamer  a farmer in Black Hawk County  Iowa  who did not plant MIR 162 corn   Asking us and then the end users to keep it segregated is a whole can of worms that nobody wants to deal with  
For Duracade corn  Syngenta has teamed with grain merchant Gavilon  owned by Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp  T 8002   to work with farmers to keep the GMO crop out of unapproved markets  The world s biggest traders  including Cargill and ADM  have said they will limit their handling of Duracade corn because China has not approved it 
Dow AgroSciences  a unit of Dow Chemical Co  N DOW   is awaiting U S  approval to begin selling Enlist  yet another type of GMO corn that is not approved for import by China  Dow officials have said they may go ahead with commercialization in the United States even without Beijing s approval 
Dow is  actively participating in industry led initiatives  as well as directly engaging with the appropriate regulatory authorities to secure approvals in China   spokeswoman Kenda Resler Friend said   
Monsanto Co  N MON   the world s largest seed company and top developer of GMO crops  did not reply to questions about its crop commercialization policies  But Monsanto leaders have been actively working to curry Chinese favor for GMO crops 
Exports of GMO crops  or crops that inadvertently contain traces of GMOs  have been a problem in the past  Many foreign buyers of alfalfa from the U S  Pacific Northwest routinely test U S  alfalfa supplies to make sure they do not contain GMOs 

U S  processors and exporters became hypersensitive to issues related to GMO corn after a variety unapproved for food use known as Starlink was discovered in a U S  shipment to Japan in 2000  Sales to the biggest U S  customers at the time   Japan and South Korea   dried up overnight  The subsequent tracing  sorting  testing  separating and certifying of GMO cost the industry millions of dollars

Stocks in this week s article include  Caleres  Inc    NYSE CAL    Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM    WellCare Health Plans  Inc   NYSE WCG    Comstock Resources  Inc    NYSE CRK   and United States Steel Corporation   NYSE X   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks in the Spotlight on Recent Broker Rating UpgradesThe Q1 earnings season is at an early stage with reports available from only a handful of companies  A high proportion of companies are yet to unveil their numbers  This is a very busy time for investors looking to add stocks  which have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the current reporting cycle  This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation However  the task of selecting stocks for handsome returns is by no means easy with a plethora of stocks flooding the market at any given point in time  The uncertainties in the investment world make the task even more daunting  This is all the more true now  as uncertainty has gripped investors owing to the Syria related tensions and the well documented concerns about Facebook  NASDAQ FB  In this backdrop  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   for an investor  Proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed to be experts  with vast knowledge of investing Generally  there are three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  Out of the three  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Broker Advice   An Invaluable GuideBrokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock Naturally  when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock  they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

171392,392908,ADM,5 Stocks Near 52 Week High  Will These Scale Higher ,opinion,A 52 week high level works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are considered winners However  investors often wonder if the high price has made the stock overpriced  While they are not totally incorrect  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in a bid to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52 week high mark However  a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time  So  one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on the catchphrase  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high are prevented from scaling higher despite potential due to the psychological bias of investors  who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  particular attention  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that doesn t always mean an impending decline  The factors   such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions   that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted  even if there are no company specific driving forces Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52 week high stocks  trading near the high level  that hold tremendous upside potential  The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and price momentum Moreover  the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  ensuring continuation of their rally for some time Current Price 52 Week High     80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range   Change Price   4 Weeks   0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedThe lower  the better P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry  This is a meaningful indicator  as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism Zacks Rank   2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to brave

171438,392954,ADM,Is Archer Daniels  ADM  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Archer Daniels has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Archer Daniels  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 1 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands quite lower than the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Archer Daniels  forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Archer Daniels has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  Thus  the stock is undervalued from this aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Archer Daniels currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Archer Daniels a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Archer Daniels might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade and Momentum score of D  each  This gives ADM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite disappointing  The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to one upward revision  while the full year estimate has seen four downward and one upward revision in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 5 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below In light of these bearish trends  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineArcher Daniels is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a Zacks Rank  3  the company has a solid Zacks Industry Rank  Top 32  out of over 250 Zacks industries  which hints at favorable broader factors   So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking SecretSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S

171502,393018,ADM,U S  Scales Back Ethanol Quotas For Gasoline,opinion,"The Environmental Protection Agency Monday issued final regulations that ease the annual requirements for ethanol in gasoline  a response to market restraints and other conditions that are preventing the Obama administration from meeting goals laid out in a 2007 law 
That law compelled refiners to blend an increasing amount of biofuels into the U S  gasoline supply each year  While the 2007 law set out goals for ethanol use  the EPA was charged with mandating the quotas on a year by year basis 
The agency is two years behind in crafting the quotas  putting the agency in the awkward position Monday of issuing the rules retroactively for 2014 and 2015 as well as establishing the mandate for 2016 
For 2014  the agency retroactively set the total amount of ethanol to be blended at 16 28 billion gallons  roughly what was actually produced  For 2015  EPA set the total level at 16 93 billion gallons  close to the estimated production for this year  And for next year  the agency set a level of 18 11 billion gallons  a significant jump 
EPA had faced a court ordered deadline to issue the 2014 and 2015 levels by Monday 
Under the new figures  the levels of ethanol required to be in refiners  fuel mix will increase less than they would have under the 2007 law  The final quotas are slightly higher than a proposal EPA rule issued in May  due in part to increased gasoline consumption in the U S  spurred by cheap gas prices 
Shares of major ethanol makers jumped on the announcement that the EPA will boost U S  renewable fuel targets above those laid out in the agency s earlier proposal  Shares of Green Plains  O GPRE   a main US ethanol supplier  up 4 5   while Pacific Ethanol  O PEIX  rises 17 5  and N ADM  largest capacity ethanol producer  pares losses  down 0 01  on Monday 
Monday s announcement coincides with the start of a two week United Nations summit in Paris  where President Barack Obama is touted the U S  commitment to tackling climate change  The biofuel mandate isn t mentioned in the U S  submission to the negotiations  however  reflecting the way policy makers now put less emphasis on the approach as a central part of reducing the nation s fossil fuel consumption 
Still  EPA officials Monday cited the new rule as an important step

Cofco s Role
China s emerging champion in food security is Cofco Corp   which controls 90 percent of China s wheat imports and has made two acquisitions this year  It bought controlling stakes in Dutch trader Nidera Holdings BV and Noble Group Limited  SIN NOBG    NOBL  s agribusiness in the space of two months  paying about  2 8 billion in total  With Noble s agribusiness Cofco gained grain elevators in Argentina and sugar mills in Brazil  as well as oilseed crushing plants in China  Ukraine and South Africa  The Nidera purchase gives Cofco a strong platform to produce grain in Brazil  Argentina and central Europe  the Chinese firm said Feb  28  Cofco will be  a powerful global agricultural trader and able to procure directly around the world   Fitch Ratings Ltd  said in an April 3 report  
Food Rivals
The numbers show why  China has 21 percent of the world s population with just 9 percent of its arable land  and an even lesser percentage of fresh water  according to Jefferies Group LLC  Rising incomes are driving demand for more protein rich food  while domestic output is close to its limits  Abhijit Attavar  an analyst with Jefferies in Singapore  said in an April 15 report  In the task of feeding China  Cofco will have plenty of competition  Archer Daniels Midland Company  NYSE ADM   Bunge Ltd Pfd  OTC BGEPF  and Cargill of the U S   as well as France s Louis Dreyfus Holding BV    known collectively as the A B C Ds    control more than 70 percent of global grain trade  according to Tokyo based Continental Rice Corp  Others sensing big opportunities in food include Japan s Mitsui   Co   Ltd   TOKYO 8031   The trading house has built a farming and trading network almost from scratch since 2007 and can tap assets on five continents  Japan s trading houses have ventured into assets as diverse as Brazil soybean plantations to Thai shrimp farms and U S  corn silos  The world s biggest oil trader Vitol Group last year expanded into grains trading by setting up a Singapore desk

171526,393042,ADM,Forget Corn  Sorghum And Barley Are The Hot Crops,opinion,"Global trade in grains reached an all time high last year at 309 million metric tons  mmt   according to the International Grains Council 
But if one looks beneath the headlines  something startling jumps out 
The staple crops of corn  wheat  and soybeans all moved into bear markets price wise last year 
Turns out the stars of the show  or   as the Financial Times calls them   the crops du jour  are two almost forgotten grains   and barley 
Why the sudden interest in these particular grains 
The answer is simple  China 
Chinese Demand Soaring
According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   Chinese imports of the two grains soared to 11 5 mmt in the 2014 2015 crop year  In the 2010 2011 crop year  imports were only 1 7 mmt 
The USDA puts Chinese imports of sorghum at 4 8 mmt for 2015 2016  That s a huge jump no one in the industry saw coming  Only a year ago  the USDA s forecast for 2023 2024 sorghum imports to China was only 1 9 mmt 
Obviously  a lot has changed in the marketplace 
The USDA puts 2023 2024 imports of barley at 5 1 mmt  That s up from the previous forecast of 2 8 mmt 
You see  China is using both of these crops as a substitute for high priced domestic corn for feeding livestock  Sorghum is also used in the production of China s favorite alcohol  baijiu  Malting barley is extensively used  also 
In addition  China doesn t like genetically modified crops  But these ancient grains aren t modified  so there aren t any import restrictions slapped on them 
Chinese demand almost single handedly drove U S  exports of sorghum to highs not seen in 35 years 
Smart Farmers Benefiting
All this Chinese demand is good for farmers smart enough to plant these crops as prices continue to rise 
Sorghum   which is surprisingly priced higher than corn right now   rose 6  in March to  246 per ton  according to the World Bank  Another plus for sorghum farmers is that the crop is drought resistant  which is a concern right now in the High Plains 
It s also cheaper to grow  Bloomberg says that  when all is considered  seed  fertilizer  and chemicals   sorghum costs just  142 per acre  In contrast  corn costs  350 per acre 
The World Bank also said that barley rose in March to  189 per ton  up 15  this year  This isn t surprising considering that the U S  sowings last year were the third lowest on record  Canada s stocks of barley also fell to a record low 
In fact  the United States has had to import supplies of malting barley from Europe  which could possibly raise the prices of domestic craft beers 
So how can the average investor participate in these hot crops 
Planting Some Investments
Well  barley is easy to invest in through futures that trade on the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   Each contract is for 20 tons and is quoted in Canadian dollar 
There is no futures contract for sorghum  So unless you re a farmer or a grain handler  the best bet is to own large grain traders like Archer Daniels Midland Company  NYSE ADM

171527,393043,ADM,New Meat Cravings Drive Grain Demand,opinion,"Peak meat consumption has likely already occurred in the developed world  U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  data shows that U S  meat consumption peaked in 2004 at 220 2 pounds per person annually  Since then  demand has declined every year  In 2014  the figure came in at an estimated 202 3 pounds 
But it s a totally different picture in the emerging world 
China  for example  is now the world s biggest pork producer  and houses half of the planet s domestic pig population  The United Kingdom s Overseas Development Institute says the increased incomes in China are almost exactly parallel to the rise in meat consumption 
India is experiencing a similar trend  Since 2009  the annual disposable income there has risen by 95   In turn  meat consumption rose by nearly 50  during the same period 
Other emerging markets are on the same pathway  Obviously  this is great news for those who are involved in the livestock and  
One obvious winner is Brazil s JBS SA  OTC JBSAY   It s the world s largest exporter of animal protein  and is a global leader in beef  lamb  and poultry processing  JBS is also a big player in pork  having just bought Cargill s pork business 
Sun Shining on the Fields
The rising demand for meat is also fabulous news for the farmers who grow grains  After all  all those animals have to eat before they re slaughtered 
Already  global grain trading was at an all time high in 2014  according to the International Grains Council  with trading reaching 309 million metric tons  mmt  last year 
As I ve related to readers before  the crops showing the fastest growth are   Chinese imports of these grains soared to 11 5 mmt in the 2014 to 2015 crop year from just 1 7 mmt in 2010 to 2011  according to USDA statistics 
China s overall agricultural imports are expected to rise to 200 mmt in a decade from 120 mmt currently 
But even brighter days are ahead for feed grain growers 
According to a report from the Organization for Economic Co Operation and Development and the United Nations  Food and Agricultural Organization  feed use made up 36  of the rise in consumption of coarse grains  not including wheat or rice  during the past decade  But the projection for the next 10 years shows that  feed demand will constitute almost 70  of the use of coarse grains  
The report forecasts that meat demand   led by the developing markets   will rise by 17   That s just a bit slower than the last decade s growth rate of 20   but it s still substantial enough to boost grain trade 
Planting Your Seeds
All of this is great news for the big grain traders such as Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland Company  NYSE ADM  
But they won t have the field to themselves 
China s state owned grains buyer  COFCO  plans to become a publicly listed grains trading powerhouse in the years ahead  It already largely controls the huge Chinese market  Just as an example  China buys two thirds of all internationally traded soybeans 
The UN s report forecasts that soybean production will need to rise 20  globally over the next decade to meet the demand for feed  That should equal good  long term prospects for soybean meal  Futures and options contracts for it can be purchased on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME  
If investors aren t comfortable dealing with futures directly  one can buy the Teucrium Soybean  NYSE SOYB   This fund contains a basket of three different soybean futures 
SOYB has been doing well recently  too  due to very wet weather in our nation s grain growing regions  This is likely   which often brings wet weather to that region 
Based on the forecast that this El Ni o will be a strong one  more gains are likely

171542,393058,ADM,Summer Drought May Clobber The Midwest,opinion,On the heels of the worst U S  drought since the 1950s  long range weather forecasts are showing that not only will the drought continue  it will intensify Consequences could be disastrous for farming and ranching communities across the Midwest   and lead to another spike in commodities prices should yields again suffer  The U S  economy is still only starting to process last year s drought  On the consumer side  recent government reports confirm that food prices have just begun to rise due to last year s drought that   at its peak last September   covered nearly two thirds of the country  Though hot weather and lack of rain caused futures prices for corn and soy to peak at new record highs last August  a lag in the country s agroprocessing system means consumers   and therefore the broader economy   won t feel the full brunt of higher supermarket prices for meat  dairy  and grains until later this year When combined with sequester led austerity  the additional pressure of sharply higher food prices  rising at double the inflation rate  could put a strain on the economy in 2013 Stock prices of ethanol producers  Archer Daniels Midland Co   ADM  and Green Plains Renewable Energy Inc   GPRE     dairy producers  like Dean Foods Co   DF    and meat producers  like Tyson Foods Inc   TSN   Smithfield Foods Inc   SFD    and Pilgrim s Pride  PPC    may be impacted With the addition of new seasonal climate forecasts for March  there is significant cause for worry in the plains states where drought could even intensify beyond 2012 levels Why you should worry Drought in the United States  well  anywhere on Earth for that matter  is driven primarily by three things these days  current conditions  including soil moisture  snowpack  and current vegetation health   climate variability  whims of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that change month to month   and climate change  which in addition to rising temperature and evaporation rates tends to favor more extreme episodes of rains and dry spells  Right now  all three of those point in the direction of another severe drought year in 2013 First  let s look at the current conditions As skiers may have noticed  snowpack in California and Colorado is between 65 79  of normal right now  one of the worst western snow seasons in recent memory  In agricultural terms  what that means is rivers feeding major agricultural zones will start out with a big strike against them Also  despite a spate of recent midwestern blizzards  this winter s precipitation across the vast majority of the country has only just kept up to normal levels or has fallen even further behind  Only tiny bits of Wisconsin  Michigan  and Ohio have managed to break their hold on last year s drought  Current soil moisture conditions show a map full of red    with dry conditions lingering over from last year Taking a look ahead using the newly released climate forecasts for March  the next few months of rainfall look increasingly meager  The current consensus four month forecast to June 2013 shows dry conditions inching eastward into the Ohio Valley from the Great Plains  Two months later  at least one model shows most of the country east of the Rockies mired in a deeply dry period  enough to intensify drought conditions to a point possibly exceeding 2012 levels These forecasts factor in all sorts of information about atmospheric and ocean circulations  and are generally the best tools that exist for long range outlooks One additional factor   a surprise La Nina   may also be in the cards  which scientists have historically tied to increased odds of drought in the United States  Predictability for La Nina is near its cycle lows right now  but it s still a point worth watching To top it all off  climate change shows no signs of releasing its stranglehold on the country s weather in 2013 Temperatures are forecasted to be warmer than normal every month as far out as our forecasts go   until at least May 2014  For this year s critical summer months  the latest forecast shows above normal temperatures from Medford  Ore  to Miami  and from Death Valley to Downeast Maine  Corn basically shuts off its growth cycle above temperatures of 95F  So  if the lack of moisture won t depress yields  the heat might  Drought also makes high temperatures more likely    dry air warms quicker than moist air    which in turn makes drought more likely  A vicious cycle that increases the odds for a drought repeat this year As a meteorologist  I try to find patterns in the data  In my work advising agricultural and livestock interests worldwide  I heard many stories last year about how forage for cattle was unavailable  for nearly any price  across big stretches of the Midwest The impact of a repeat drought  possibly the third year in a row for parts of Texas and Oklahoma  would place an exponentially greater amount of stress on livestock in areas where herd sizes have already been reduced simply due to lack of available feed  Even if rains were to return to normal for the coming few years  it would still take ranchers years to rebuild their herds from the harsh impact of the 2012 drought alone  A repeat would amount to sucker punching farmers while they re down  The patterns outlined above would be just that At least one state  South Dakota  is already openly fretting about what a repeat of last year would do to tax revenues and the state s economy  During this fragile economic recovery  back to back disasters will have a much  much greater impact However  there s some cause for hope  last month  the USDA released their annual outlook for the coming growing season  and forecasted record or near record production of corn and soy   two of the crops hit hardest by last summer s drought Their outlook says increased production will largely be driven by more acres being planted as farmers scramble to take advantage of high prices  Last year  the USDA took the rare step of allowing farmers to produce hay on land semi permanently enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program  which is designed to provide buffer land for wildlife and ecosystem health  in a last ditch effort to compensate for drought impacted low farm yields  Enrollment in that program is down again this year as farmers trade
