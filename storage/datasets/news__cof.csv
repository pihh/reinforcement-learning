to Mr  Blackley  Scott Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jeff  I ll begin tonight with Slide 3  Capital One earned  5 5 billion  or  11 05 per diluted common share in 2019  On an adjusted basis  earnings per share were  12 09 for 2019  In the fourth quarter net income was  1 2 billion  or  2 25 per share  Net of adjusting items  our EPS in the quarter was  2 49 per share  We had three adjusting items in the quarter  which are outlined on Slide 14 of our earnings presentation First  we had a  48 million or  0 08 per share expense of launch and integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership  This brings the full year total expense to  211 million and concludes the one time expenses related to the Walmart partnership launch  Additionally  we had an allowance reserve build for the acquired Walmart portfolio of  84 million or  0 13 per share  The reserve build as well as the launch and integration costs are recorded in our domestic card business  Lastly  we had  23 million of charges related to the cyber incident that we announced at the end of July  These charges were partially offset by an insurance reimbursement receivable of  7 million resulting in a net impact of  16 million or  0 03 per share  We continue to expect a portion of these charges and insurance recoveries will extend beyond 2019 In addition to the adjusting items  we recognized  31 million in costs related to the redemption of our Series C and D preferred stock on December 2  We also had an incremental  17 million of dividend expense associated with the cost of carrying the new Series I issuance in addition to Series C and D for most of the quarter  Collectively  these costs decreased Q4 earnings per share by  0 10 As a reminder  preferred dividends impact EPS  but they do not impact net income Moving on to quarterly performance  relative to a year ago adjusted pre provision earnings increased 17  with revenue increasing 7   operating expenses increasing 4  and marketing decreasing by 15   Compared to the prior year quarter  provision for credit losses increased 11   owing to a larger allowance build and a modest increase in charge offs Let me take a moment to discuss the quarterly movements in our allowance across our businesses  which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement  Our card business saw an allowance build of  107 million  essentially flat outside of the  84 million initial allowance reserve build for the acquired Walmart portfolio  In our consumer business  there was a build of  31 million driven by continued growth in our auto business  And lastly  reserves in our commercial business declined by  4 million as charge offs in the quarter more than offset builds in allowance related to our energy portfolio December 31st  2019 marked the end of the allowance accounting that we have all known for decades  We estimate that the 1 1 2020 adoption of CECL will increase our allowance by approximately  2 9 billion and reduce our CET1 ratio by 16 basis points in the first quarter  We have broken out the CECL allowance transition impacts by reported segment on Slide 4 Turning to Slide 5  net interest margin was 6 95  in the quarter and 6 83  for the full year of 2019  Relative to the prior quarter  net interest margin was largely flat  On a linked quarter basis  net interest margin increased 22 basis points or 14 basis points  excluding the negative impact in Q3 from U K  PPI  The 14 basis points of improvement was partly driven by asset mix  including the on boarding of the Walmart portfolio in the quarter which reduced cash and securities and partly by the effects of seasonal loan growth We continue to have a relatively neutral near term posture to interest rate changes  Over the longer term persistently low interest rates will be a headwind for us and the industry Turning to Slide 6  I will cover capital  Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis this quarter was 12 2   In the fourth quarter  we purchased approximately 941 million or 10 million Capital One common shares  We ve now completed approximately  1 4 billion of our 2019 CCAR authorization of  2 2 billion Recall that in October the Fed finalized the tailoring rule with an expected implementation in the first quarter of 2020  When we adopt the rule  we expect to opt out of AOCI for regulatory capital purposes  As a result  on December 31st  we transferred our held to maturity securities to available for sale  resulting in an AOCI increase of approximately  890 million  Inclusive of this transfer  our December 31st AOCI position for AFS securities increased CET1 in the fourth quarter by about 30 basis points  Accordingly  when we opt out of AOCI in the first quarter  Q1 2020 CET1 will decrease by about 30 basis points  all else equal As we are preparing for CCAR 2020  we still believe that our long term capital need is around 11  CET1  Let me take a minute to talk about the factors impacting our capital need  In the 2019 CCAR  the Fed s implementation of the new card loss model created a headwind to our capital under stress  Conversely  the effects of the recently finalized tailoring rule will provide a tailwind to our capital reduction under stress  We also believe there is an opportunity for further capital relief under the stress capital buffer framework and we continue to keep an eye on the Fed s implementation of CECL  which will occur in CCAR 2022  How and when the Fed implements these changes in CCAR will be a key factor in when we will be able to manage our CET1 closer to the 11  long term capital need With that let me turn the call over to Rich  Rich Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThanks  Scott  I ll begin on Slide 9  which summarizes fourth quarter results for our credit card business  The credit card business delivered solid results with stable credit and strong growth in loans  purchase volume and revenue  Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business  which is shown on Slide 10 Domestic card ending loan balances increased by  11 3 billion or 10 5  year over year driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio and strong growth of branded cards  partially offset by our choice to exit several small partnership portfolios in the second quarter  Branded card loans  which exclude all private label and co branded cards  grew 5 7  from the prior year quarter  Domestic card average loans for the quarter were up 9 3  compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 We posted another strong quarter of purchase volume growth  as we continued to grow our heavy spender franchise  Year over year domestic card purchase volume growth was 10 7   Net interchange revenue for the total Company grew 9 2   Revenue increased 7 2  from the fourth quarter of 2018  driven by the growth in average loans  Revenue margin declined 31 basis points  More than 100  of the decline was driven by the revenue sharing agreement on the acquired Walmart portfolio  Noninterest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter  Domestic card credit remained strong and stable  The charge off rate for the quarter was 4 32   a 32 basis point improvement year over year  driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio  Because the delinquency rate is not affected by the loss sharing agreement  the addition of the Walmart portfolio put upward pressure on the fourth quarter 30 plus delinquency rate  Despite this upward pressure  the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 11 basis points from the end of the prior year quarter to 3 93   Pulling up our domestic card business continued to deliver strong results with top line growth and strong and stable credit Slide 11 summarizes fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business  Ending loans increased 6 5  year over year  Average loans for the fourth quarter grew 5 5  from the prior year quarter  Our auto business delivered strong year over year origination growth at a modest acceleration of loan growth along with stable credit results and loan yields  all in a marketplace with increasing competitive intensity  Digital innovation is a key driver of our momentum in the auto business Powered by our national banking strategy  ending deposits in the consumer bank were up  14 5 billion  or 7 3  year over year  Average deposit interest rate for the quarter increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year quarter  The rate increase was primarily a result of a product mix shift toward higher rate deposit products throughout the year  The deposit interest rate declined 11 basis points from the sequential quarter driven by the market interest rate environment  Our average deposit rate paid going forward will depend on several factors  including the market interest rate environment  our deposit mix  our funding needs and competitive dynamics Consumer banking revenue decreased 1 8  from the fourth quarter of last year  Underlying revenue growth from higher auto loans and retail deposits was more than offset by two effects  Differences in the timing of federal reserve rate cuts versus our deposit pricing moves pressured revenue in the fourth quarter  And the fourth quarter of 2018 included a small tail of revenue from the legacy home loans and investing businesses  There was no revenue from these legacy businesses in the fourth quarter of this year Noninterest expense was up 2 3   Volume driven growth and expenses and our continuing investments to grow and transform were partially offset by the lack of expenses from the legacy businesses  Fourth quarter provision for credit losses increased  32 million year over year  Auto loan growth drove an allowance build The auto charge off rate improved 8 basis points compared to the prior year quarter to 1 90   Better than expected auction values and a benign economy continued to support strong auto credit  We continue to expect that the annual auto charge off rate will gradually increase as the cycle plays out Moving to Slide 12  I ll discuss our commercial banking business  Ending loan balances were up 5 9  year over year  Quarterly average loan balances were up 6 5  compared to the fourth quarter a year ago  Average deposits increased 4 4   Fourth quarter revenue was up 7 5  from the prior year quarter  driven by growth in average loan balances and strong noninterest income  Noninterest expense was up 1 6  compared to the prior year quarter Provision for credit losses increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  driven by our energy portfolio  The commercial banking charge off rate for the fourth quarter was 0 35  and criticized loan rates were relatively stable compared to both the prior year and sequential quarters  The criticized performing loan rate for the fourth quarter was 2 9  and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0 6   In our commercial banking business  we re keeping a watchful eye on market conditions  Unregulated competitors continue to put pressure on pricing  loan spreads and loan terms  Against that backdrop  we are carefully choosing our spots and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices Pulling way up in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019  Capital One continued to post solid results as we invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation  Our marketing investments continued to build momentum across our businesses  In domestic card  we generated strong year over year growth in purchase volume and solid growth in loans  Credit results were strong and stable and we successfully launched the Walmart partnership In consumer banking  our auto business delivered solid loan growth with stable credit and loan yields and our national banking strategy achieved strong year over year growth in retail deposits Looking ahead  marketing will  as always  depend upon our continuous assessment of opportunities in the competitive marketplace  As we enter 2020  we continue to see resilient growth opportunities in all of our businesses and we ll have a full year of marketing for the new Walmart partnership  With the momentum we have in domestic cards and national retail banking  plus the incremental Walmart marketing  we expect full year 2020 marketing expense will be moderately higher than full year 2019 marketing expense We remain all in on our technology transformation and our progress continues  We are realizing significant and growing benefits across the Company  faster to market  better products  better customer experience  better risk management  more growth  better economics  We re on the home stretch of our transition to the cloud and we re on track to exit our data centers near the end of this year  Until then  we continue to operate with one foot in the legacy data center environment and one foot in the cloud  Along the way  we re working hard to improve operating efficiency even with the elevated costs of straddling both the data center and cloud environment In 2019  we posted a 45 basis point improvement in annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments and we expect to achieve another year of modest improvement in 2020  We continue to expect a bigger move down in our annual operating efficiency ratio to 42  in 2021 net of adjustments  We expect the larger improvement in 2021 to be aided by the full exit of the data centers and the associated costs of straddling two environments  the increased traction in our businesses enhanced by technology and the step up in revenue share on the acquired Walmart portfolio  which will occur in the fourth quarter of 2020  We continue to expect that the improvement in annual operating efficiency ratio will drive significant improvement in annual total efficiency ratio by 2021 as well As the many benefits from our technology transformation continue and increase  we are well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long term shareholder value Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsThank you  Rich  We ll now start the Q A session  As a courtesy to other investors and the analysts who may wish to ask a question  please limit yourself to one question  plus a single follow up  If you have any additional follow up questions after the Q A session  Investor Relations team will be available after the call Matt  please start the Q A Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs Ryan Nash    Goldman Sachs   Company  Inc     AnalystHey  Good evening guys Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentGood evening  Ryan Ryan Nash    Goldman Sachs   Company  Inc     AnalystHi  Rich  Maybe just start off  Phonetic  question for Scott  So thank you for the moving pieces on CECL across the different products  I guess now that day one is behind us  any color you can give us regarding the day two impact and maybe can you just talk about it across each of the different portfolios  and I have one follow up Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  Well  when I think about day two  I m going to start off by just saying we gave segment level multiples  And I think they are a good foundation for you to use those multiples and apply them to what you would have been estimating under the prior regime for allowance builds in 2020  So I think that s  in general  a good place to start in terms of thinking about day two I think that the multiple that we ve talked about could change gradually if performance    the portfolio performance or the portfolio mix really changes in the future  But I think those are going to be changes that happen over time  So the transition multiples are probably a good place to start Ryan Nash    Goldman Sachs   Company  Inc     AnalystGot it  And Rich  maybe just a question on both operating and overall efficiency  So you made nice progress in 2019 despite a handful of headwinds  I guess  what are the biggest swing factors that could impact reaching 42  or is it    is it the fact that everything is coming offline in the fourth quarter that you have such a high degree of confidence  And then I guess second  just given where we are in the cycle  you talked about marketing being up moderately this year  is there a scenario where you could see it accelerating or would you expect us to remain at around these levels plus or minus like you articulated in your outlook  Thanks Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo  Ryan  let s talk about the operating efficiency ratio  We re like a year into when we set this guidance and it was certainly a stepping out of character for Capital One to be so specific so many years out  And as we have talked all along the way  the    there are several things that have driven our confidence  There are certain things that are to call them math is a little bit understating the sort of incredible work associated with doing it  but in a sense  getting out of the data centers is something that    with the extraordinary achievement of doing it  we have a    I think a very good handle on what the costs of straddling those environments have been and what the benefit of just being all in on the cloud is  The math of the Walmart step up  that is what it is  that s contractual  and so I think that s a very reliable thing  The    another thing that aids the continued improvement here and the larger improvement in 2021 is the increased traction that we expect in our businesses that we can in fact see unfolding and that we expect to continue  Obviously  that has uncertainty around it  like any estimate of future business performance and growth  but a lot of that is sort of in the works that can be affected by changes in the marketplace  changes in the economy  changes in choices that we make  But this is the product of a bunch of work that we have been doing  The success of our marketing and account origination in prior years  which we ve spent a lot of time talking about and the    some of the technology innovation that has been going on  So we feel good about that  Obviously that has uncertainty to it And the other    the other element in the uncertainty equation is what happens to operating costs of 1 minus  Phonetic  the data center exit and the    and all the associated costs of straddling that will be eliminated and there can always be risk to cost estimates  but we spent    we ve worked very hard  and this is not like a new thing  we worked hard for years  driving    gradually driving down the efficiency ratio and being very disciplined on operating costs We do have some growing benefit that comes on the technology side here with respect to technology cost savings  And collectively when we put all that together  while as always there is uncertainty in this  here we are  we at our bold shingle that we hung out a year ago  here we are a year into it  and we feel as good as we did at the time that we launched it  And I m pretty struck by in a world where so many things change  how    what we had in mind is continuing to unfold  And that s because it s the product of a lot of work for a long period of time With respect to marketing  the first thing I want to say is we don t give precise    well  in most years  in many ways  we don t give marketing guidance at all and we    what I would say about marketing is and the impression I want to leave you with is  we continue to feel very good about our marketing investment  We    in card marketing is strengthening our heavy spender franchise  driving strong new account originations  growth in purchase volume  net interchange revenue  loans  On the bank side  the increased marketing is fueling deposit growth along with cafe and brand awareness  We re seeing a lot of traction just overall in our brand metrics and brand equities that are critical to building a franchise And also we re a company that doesn t have 6 000 branches  We re a company that actually isn t at the top of the lead table in terms of co brand partnerships and a lot of things  So we have to build our business the old fashion way  kind of one customer at a time  and our marketing machine is a key part of that So what I would    what I would leave you with is  we continue to feel very good about the marketing  We ve got a new addition here in terms of the full year of the Walmart marketing  And so that s going to be yet another factor that pulls up the numbers there  There is always    we will always make our final determinations based on the opportunities and necessities that we see in the marketplace  But I wanted to just give you that general window into how we re feeling about the marketing Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorYour next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW Sanjay Sakhrani    Keefe Bruyette   Woods    AnalystThanks  I wanted to follow up on the day two seasonal impact  Scott  When you look at the Street consensus provisions out there and I m just looking at our own  we re assuming 6  ish loan growth flat charge offs and we have the provision of 20   I mean  does that look commensurate to sort of what you re articulating or is this something else Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerSanjay  why don t I just step back and give you a little bit of a picture of what s going to happen with CECL  So  just to go back and ground out how CECL is going to work  Allowance movements under CECL are really driven by the same factors that drove the allowance under the prior regime  So you start off with loan balances at the end of the period  you ve got expected future losses and recoveries on balances and then we have qualitative factors that are not captured in our modeling and we have those on top  Of those three factors  it s really the second one that changes under CECL  And because we re now going to be holding an allowance for the expected lifetime losses  And importantly we re also going to be having the lifetime recoveries and that s    I ll come to that in just a minute as to why that s such an important factor  So that s the biggest    the biggest step change under CECL  So let me kind of just put this together for you and tell you how we re going to do it  We start with a 12 month loss outlook which we forecast  We then extend that into a lifetime forecast and when we do that we assume a gradual reversion of losses to historical averages after that first year  And then we overlay that with future recoveries and future recoveries are a big offset to our CECL allowance  Prior to CECL we offset our allowance with expected recoveries for only the next 12 months  With CECL we will be offsetting our allowance with the    with all estimated future recoveries  And relatively speaking recoveries have a larger offsetting impact under CECL than they did under the prior allowance regime because we tend to see a longer tail of recoveries on our charge offs So  net of all of that I think you re going to see a 1 42  Phonetic  multiple on our allowance in our domestic card business at the point of transition  1 49  Phonetic  multiple for our auto business  And as I mentioned in my first answer  I think those are relatively stable Your question about  well  how might this look in periods of ability and in periods of growth  let me just kind of answer that real quick  In periods of stability  you re really just going to have take that multiple and apply it to whatever allowance build that you are thinking about and that includes moderate growth and a stable economy  There is a couple of things that could cause that implied CECL multiple to vary over time  And let me give you a couple examples  So  the first is that as you know  and we ve talked about CECL pulls forward the allowance expense associated with new lending  And    so all else equal  our implied CECL multiple would probably go up in periods of higher growth And just to give you a bit of a sensitivity there  During our growth surge in 2014 and 2015  the implied multiple during that period if we had lived under CECL would have been higher  perhaps in the 1 6  Phonetic  range  So just to give you a sense like there s a lot of things that could move around that if we just kind of took hindsight and applied kind of where we see things we can see the multiple going up into that range On the flip side of that in periods of high recoveries  you could actually see the multiple go down  So in periods immediately after a downturn where there is higher    we ve got this big portfolio of recoveries  those might actually start to be a bigger factor and push the ultimate multiple down So I know that was a bit of a long answer  but hopefully that gives you a sense of kind of the moving pieces of how CECL is going to work day two Sanjay Sakhrani    Keefe Bruyette   Woods    AnalystAll right  thank you  I have one follow up  Just on the Walmart portfolio  I know it was known to have a lower tender share penetration  I was wondering if that s a big growth opportunity in 2020 and a contributor to card growth  And then just a clarification on the marketing expense outlook for 2020  Would this year s growth be moderately higher  sort of was that a good comparison in terms of the growth rate  Thank you Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentCould you repeat the second question  Sanjay  your clarification question Sanjay Sakhrani    Keefe Bruyette   Woods    AnalystYeah  On the marketing expense growth  you mentioned moderately higher  I was just wondering if 2019 s growth rate would be commensurate with moderately higher  in terms of  Phonetic  like mid single digits growth Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerOkay  So the    I think what we have this year is a continuation of the momentum that we had last year  And I want to say also to my response to Ryan Nash s opening question that one of the important drivers of 42  is the continuing traction in the business and marketing is a very important element of that  And in fact    so we    a way to think about it is we start with an opportunity  in a sense a growing opportunity on the marketing side consistent with what we re seeing overlay that with Walmart  which is a new thing  And those two things together is what is driving our guidance of a moderate increase in marketing Rich  do you want to talk about this question on the growth opportunity from    growth opportunity in the Walmart portfolio Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  let me say it s certainly an honor and an opportunity to partner with not only the world s largest retailer actually the world s largest company    Fortune 1 company and to launch a digital first card program  So the    for Capital One  the opportunity divides itself into a back book where we have converted the old Synchrony back book and we ve told you a lot about the size and the general parameters associated with that  And then there will over time be a growing front book that will be the originations that we do under this new partnership  We re not going to be specifically guiding to that front book because in many ways this will have a lot of similarity to many of the front book things that we do at Capital One Certainly the size of Walmart and  at this point  the    relative to other partnerships the penetration levels of the credit card relationships  there is certainly upside there and I think Walmart certainly believes that and so do we  But it s    we re in the very early stages of this  but I think we are very pleased with the way our two companies are partnering here Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsThanks  Next question please OperatorAnd your next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thanks  You referred to a 5 7  growth in the branded cards that I think was the same number that you referenced in the third quarter  so roughly the same level as growth Could you just talk a little bit about what the kind of the outlook is  I mean  because that does exclude Walmart  So talk a little bit about whether that branded growth is going to be accelerating or decelerating and the impact may be on overall growth from Walmart  And I do have a follow up Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  Moshe  so first of all  the front book of    since it starts at zero the front book by definition will be a growing book  I also want to point out the back book of Walmart with the loss rate that it has is a run off portfolio that s running off at a pretty sizable clip relative to portfolios otherwise that we have  So there are going to be two forces going in opposite directions there and we ll have to see how that plays out  But we re certainly very happy to have that partnership The outlook  look I think we continue to feel good about the growth opportunities in the card business  But I think it s more a continuation of the story that we have been talking about before in terms of we re benefited by a number of years of strong account origination  We have been over time increasing credit lines as we have validated each successive vintage  it s coming in as good as it is  And in fact  if anything  the recent vintages are outperforming in a good way by a bit some of the earlier vintages  So all that is good that gives us the confidence to continue to drive the originations and also the continuing confidence on the credit line side  And this is all in the context of an economy that s already the longest in length in recorded history here between recessions  But    so with a cautious eye at the environment  the things that we ve been talking about for a number of quarters are continuing to find traction and that    and then a very important element of that is the success of the marketing  So that s why we feel good about the growth opportunity Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  And just as a follow up  a little bit of housekeeping  noninterest income outside of interchange revenue and service fees  kind of that other line was up very nicely both from the third quarter and a year ago  Was that primarily just the change in the absence of the PPI charge or are there other factors as well Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerMoshe  can you just    which specific line item are you looking at Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystWhat you guys have called kind of other income  it was up like 55   60  of Q3 and 90  or so from a year ago Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerRight Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystI believe both of those had the PPI charges in them Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So a few things that impact that line item  So other noninterest income really is driven by oftentimes marks on a variety of different a situation  So  the first is  we actually have some compensation related assets that we mark and we take the benefit of those marks runs through this line item in revenue and there is an offsetting expense that runs through and elevates FCNB  Phonetic   So in the period with the run up in the market  there was a pretty healthy amount of mark on compensation  The other thing that runs through there  we do occasionally have partner payments that are coming in under the contracts  Those can run through there and be a bit lumpy  I think that the level that you re seeing in Q4 is a bit elevated to what I would expect on a run rate basis Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorYour next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  good evening Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentHi  Betsy Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystJust switching gears a little bit  talking about NIM  I know that NIM went up nicely in the quarter and    but I think your comment in your prepared remarks surround how lower rates are a little bit of a headwind  So I just wanted to square those two things and understand how you re thinking about the outlook for NIM  You had a nice decline in the deposit costs  I don t know if  Phonetic  you could speak to that a little bit Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerBetsy  as I mentioned last quarter  we have been talking for a number of quarters about headwinds from deposit mix and deposit pricing and we have started to see those abate a little bit last quarter  When I look at NIM this quarter  I mentioned that there were two primary factors that drove NIM up on a linked quarter basis  One of those was asset mix which was the larger of the two factors that I described  The other was    the other factor was seasonal loan growth  So we re seeing a bit of    that traction in there The cost    deposit pricing is embedded in that as well as things like accelerated amortization on the premiums that we have  some of the securities  all of that s embedded in there  So overall  I think that when it comes to the impact of deposit pricing our betas have been relatively low since the declining rate cycle started that may be an opportunity  Rich mentioned the types of factors that would drive where deposit pricing goes  So I think we ll have to see where that moves to  but at this point  I don t really see any outsized impact whether positively or negative on our net interest margin Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And then    it s the mix really driving the buzz on that  When I think about the CECL outlook here  and I know  Indecipherable  quite a bit  I just wanted to see if you could give us some color around the commercial banking increase in your day one  I ask just because some of the other folks we look at had declines in commercial  So I want to understand what was driving a little bit of a different outcome for you Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerIt is so hard for me to judge what others are doing on their estimates  It depends on the life  a variety of factors  So I can t even hazard a guess when it comes to commercial  just because the portfolios are pretty different  So I really honestly don t have an answer for you on that one Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsNext question  please OperatorAnd your next question will come from Rick Shane with J P  Morgan Richard Shane    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for taking my question  I think we d all agree that a  100 loan balance on January 1st after the holidays would have a different repaying behavior than a  100 loan balance on May 1st after tax refunds been distributed I realize from a CECL perspective  you re supposed to take lifetime loss assumptions on both  But I m trying to understand how does the practical difference in terms of that near term repayment behavior in capture lifetime loss reserve  And said slightly differently  is 5  growth in December the same as 5  growth in June Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerRick  I would just say that seasonal growth and transactors we look at those  we look at the likelihood of revolving  we use historical empirical data about how quickly those get paid down  They don t tend to have large lifetime allowances and in general  I would say those aren t really a factor that s driving the multiples that we disclosed Richard Shane    J P  Morgan    AnalystGot it  So  as a follow up to that  we wouldn t necessarily expect to see that same seasonality because you are able to factor in in the short term the repayment behaviors Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I    broadly speaking  all else equal  I think that s true Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorAnd your next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo Donald J  Fandetti    Wells Fargo Securities  LLC    AnalystYes  Rich  there s been a lot of talk in the backing of payments in industry about B2B and Capital One and the top three small business card issuer  Can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic there and what your thoughts are in terms of growth  And is that growing faster than your consumer business Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo the    our small business business  we don t break that out separately  We are    as we are in the consumer side  one of the top players in the lead table in that particular space Amex is way north of the rest of us unlike the shorter distance between competitors on the consumer side  But that business is a business that a simple extrapolation    a simple transfer of a consumer approach or a lift and shift of a commercial approach ends up being a sub optimal thing  And the traction and success we ve gotten in the small business space comes from really working backwards from the customer and the customer needs over a very  very long period of time  And the    so a lot of the underlying dynamics are the same in that business in terms of the shift in payments  the reduction in cash and checks and so on  But what I would leave you with is like our some of the other investments we ve made at Capital One  this is many years kind of in the making and we re continuing to generate successful growth there The one thing I would say is that on both the consumer side and certainly the small business and the commercial side  the change that is going on in payments is breathtaking  I think it s really at the vortex of technology change in all of banking  And that s partly because the digitization of transactions is a very natural place to go  but it s also one of the places that is not regulated or it s very lightly regulated  And furthermore it is the place where many tech companies who really don t want to be carrying around bank holding company badges and things like that  focused on how they can try to win on the front end of banking and leave a lot of the back end of banking to the banks  So I m excited by the opportunity in    on the business side as well as the consumer side  but I m certainly struck by the breathtaking rate of change  And I think for every player in the business  there is a real imperative to come up with the strategy and work backwards from where the world is going instead of forward from where we are Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsDo you have a follow up  Don Donald J  Fandetti    Wells Fargo Securities  LLC    AnalystNo  I m all set Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorNext question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystAfternoon  Thanks very much for taking my questions  Just    not looking for guidance  but just thinking conceptually long term  it would seem logical that you could do more digital customer aggregation with the digital bank in place  Would that    is it fair to think that customer acquisition costs  the costs tied to physical mailings and so forth may be more efficient going forward Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWait  I want to make sure  John  could you explain a little bit more of your question again John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystIt s just you guys have invested a lot more to digital banking platform and it s clear to us that as a user of your website  you can do more online  And so the question is  given that your consumers can do more online  are there cross selling opportunities  are there other opportunities to reduce your customer acquisition costs for a specific product Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  so from the    interestingly from the    the founding notion of this Company  one of the founding notions was that marketing is going to be reinvented by the technology and information revolution  And so  way back with old fashion direct mail  we set out to build the business and we also didn t have a    it was by being very small  we didn t have much of a cross sell opportunity  So much of the heritage of the Company for a long period of time was focused on the origination of business  And one of the great prizes that awaited us over time was to have a scale franchise and there are two parts to that  One is to really be large  but the other is to be a franchise  And if you overlay the whole digital revolution on that  I want to redouble your point that I think the opportunity that awaits the companies who have    who bring three things to the table is extraordinary One is the table stake is you really need to be large and however important scale was in the past  it is more important every day and I believe it was very important in the past  The second thing that one needs to bring to the table is great digital capability and that s not just in terms of nice apps and that kind of thing  but also the information based capabilities which increasingly are very benefited by real time big data and the use of machine learning  So there is a great opportunity there  That s the second leg of the stool  if you will  but I really  really    what we believe at the outset and what we certainly live every day is there is a third leg of the stool  And that is that you have to have a loyal customer franchise  Just having eyeballs lying around just having a large customer base  it s nice  but the non linear things that happen when there is a deep and loyal franchise is a great thing  If you look at the essence of Capital One strategy over all of these years  we started with nothing and then expanded years and years in the quest for scale Secondly  we have starting with an information based strategy many years ago and really    and that was again pre Internet and all of that  but where we ve come over time the whole tech transformation driving toward great digital capability and real time machine learning Big Data capability  And then finally  and maybe of all of them this is the hardest one to build  is really building that loyal customer franchise  which is all about a great customer experience  products that people can rely on  a customer relationship that to tell your friends about and ultimately a brand that stands out  And I appreciate your question because that has been three legs of the strategy for many  many years and I think the growing traction that we re having on a lot of fronts  including on the financial side  is a product of that opportunity  And I think the    there is a lot more upside from here Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorAnd your next question will come from Brian Hogan with William Blair Brian Hogan    William Blair    AnalystGood afternoon  Thanks  First question is on the competition and your views on the Applecart and the potential pressure that come from that  Phonetic  competitor and their growth has been pretty dramatical in the first year or so  And then a follow up on that is actually potential competition from like the challenger banks like Chime and Baro and 26  Phonetic  and others  Are you seeing any customer losses from those Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentRight  So  Brian your question is about competition  Our focus is really more on the sort of the tech side and the new innovation as opposed to just the    let me start with just a comment about competition in general and then    in the card business  and then let me pivot to some specific things  The credit card business  I think  has    I think back to the founding of Capital One is I would say that Capital One is a very young company to most    compared to most of our bank competitors  They have been around for over 100 years  In Capital One s case  it s not an accident that we started with credit cards  because we had a belief way back then that credit cards structurally had a number of advantages that would allow them to have very good earnings power and also be absolutely at the tip of the spear of where the whole tech revolution and information revolution were taking in  Phonetic   It is funny over 25 years into this journey  I m finding a lot of the same observations that we had before And I think the credit card as a business is kind of standing out in these times  relative to the earnings power of the business like this  as well as some of the growth opportunities that it has  That said that insight is not lost on our competitors and this is a very competitive business  But because of the scale requirements in the business  it is    it s a very consolidated business and I think most of the competition revolves around the top 10 players in the business  And I think the competition is intense  but I think it s fundamentally rational  But the intent shows up in marketing intensity  rewards  offers  pricing and various things  But if we pull way up and I cross calibrate to other parts of banking in which we play this feels like we are in  Phonetic  the area with the highest opportunity and the most kind of rational marketplace at the moment Let me pivot to the tech marketplace  Often we are asked by investors about fintechs and what about this start up and that start up  and of course we keep an eye on that  I think the sort of elephant in the room is the gigantic tech companies and these sort of opportunities that they have  And so we ve always had a lot of respect for that and frankly our tech transformation is motivated in many ways by trying to emulate and learn from some of the best practices of those companies  It certainly has our attention  When Apple launches the Applecart  I think it was a really  really well done marketing campaign  which is universally what we ve observed from Apple for many  many years  And we ll keep an eye on that  but I would say that that now adds to the list of impressive competitors and impressive offerings that we are up against If we pivot to the challenger banks that are out there  so I m going to switch more to the deposit and banking side of the business  there are some really striking numbers that have been posted by companies that are trying to establish themselves in banking We know from having spent a lot of years doing this and right now having a national banking strategy and you see us on television  it is a really hard thing to dislodge business from the established banks with great scale and local presence and    so that all of us are working very hard on that  I have been struck by the numbers of account origination that are coming out of some of the challenges banks  The biggest question I have  and I don t know the answer  it s just the question I have is how much activity level and true sustaining traction do they have  I m not saying they don t  I think it s something that is an important place to look But we inspired by some of the innovation our competitors are doing and it s a reminder to all of us that if we really lean into a tech innovation  there is an opportunity to chip away at the extraordinary position that a few of the biggest banks in the US have Jeff Norris    Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorYour final question on the evening will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystPerfect  Thank you for fitting me in  Rich in your commentary you alluded to the fact that competition in the auto space intensified to some extent  Can you just give us a little more insight on what you were referring to  in what ways that manifested  And then I have one quick unrelated follow up Richard D  Fairbank    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYeah  so the auto business has a relatively small number of very large players and I ve often said  Eric  that competition in auto is even more impactful than    in the short term than competition in card  only because on the auto side you have a dealer in the middle of an auction and when the dealer sees something from a particular lender  like a looser credit policy or a different pricing  the dealer can drive a significant amount of business in a way that just doesn t happen in the one to one marketing that happens on the card side  So it s why almost every conversation that we have about auto and every time we celebrate a particular growth that we have  we always caution how big that factor is and how much that factor can create adverse selection if people are loosening their credit policies So what we do is we invest heavily in technology in this business and we re absolutely every quarter we re out there to get whatever opportunity we can have consistent with our own standards  and with a very  very watchful eye on the competition  In the last    over the last few years there was a pull back of a couple of competitors that we took advantage of  Both of them have certainly returned and are pretty aggressive players in the space  And what we would describe to you is that the competition is increasing in the auto space  It s nothing to wave red flags about  but it s generally increasing and the    it s a little bit unusual that at the same time we re saying competition is increasing that we re also saying we    our originations and even our book of business overall actually increasing  That is something that may be a little bit anomalous There is also something hard for us to tease out is the growing traction that we re getting by the very heavy investment we have in technology in the auto business that s in terms of underwriting real time big data driven  underwriting the creation of products for customers and dealers in this space that are very sophisticated tech driven products that actually have real time mass scoring of any car anywhere across the nations and the continued success that we ve had in building deep dealer relationships  So it s a particularly kind of good quarter for Capital One  But I think the impression I would leave you is the competitive meter is rising and we ll have to keep an eye on that And the other very important thing that is probably the most important thing that we all should keep in mind in this business is that the auto business has been credit performance in the    I m speaking of the industry now that has been benign for a long period of time  And at the top of the list is why that is so  is what has happened  what is going on with used car prices  which have been stayed at a relatively high level for a long period of time  This is a collateral driven business  I also think when you have businesses where the collateral values have been high for a long period of time  one ask that    we have to ask ourselves what collateral assumptions    collateral value assumptions are underwriters making across the industry  I ll tell you what we do and we assume they re going down  I can t speak for the whole industry  but I just want to put a caution that we ve had good times for a long time in that business and collateral values have been an unusually strong ally and one forever Eric Wasserstrom    UBS    AnalystThank you for that  And my very quick follow up  Scott  is just on the tax rate  It looks like it came in around 19  in this quarter    percent or so  How should    was there anything special in this period  some true ups or something  And how should we think about the appropriate rate going forward Scott Blackley    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Let me comment on more of the full year tax rate because that s what I would point you to  the full year tax rate was about 19 5   I would say that s a reasonable baseline  It s going to be plus or minus from there depending on income levels evolutions in our credit  the businesses that generate tax credits  but nothing particularly large  We did have some discretes in the quarter  which drove down the quarterly rate  but 19 5  is a good starting point for how you should think about the future Jeff Norris

147509,369025,COF,Courts are the next front in Trump s battle over presidential powers,news,"By Lawrence Hurley and Jan Wolfe WASHINGTON  Reuters    In federal court and on the Senate floor  lawyers for President Donald Trump have argued that the U S  Constitution confers on a president broad protection from scrutiny by Congress  prosecutors and the judiciary for his actions  This expansive view of presidential powers may have helped the Republican president win acquittal on Wednesday in his Senate impeachment trial  but a raft of court rulings due in the coming weeks and months could have an even more profound impact on setting the parameters for a president s authority  Three cases will be argued before the Supreme Court on March 31 focusing on Trump s contention that a House of Representatives committee and a New York City prosecutor are powerless to enforce subpoenas to obtain his financial records  Lawyers for Trump argued that the Constitution renders sitting presidents immune from all criminal investigations and that even if he shot someone on New York s Fifth Avenue prosecutors would be powerless to act while he was still in office  The Supreme Court eventually could be called upon to decide another major case now awaiting a ruling in the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  In that one  the Justice Department argued that senior presidential aides are immune from congressional subpoenas for testimony like one issued by the Democratic led House Judiciary Committee to former White House Counsel Don McGahn  The rulings in those cases could set enduring legal precedents  In impeachment trials   no current Congress can bind a future Congress   said University of Missouri law professor and impeachment expert Frank Bowman  meaning whatever arguments Trump s lawyers advanced applied only to that trial   Courts are different  They have got to explain  And  at least in theory  what the high court decides binds all lower courts   Bowman added  The Supreme Court previously curbed presidential power in key cases   In 1997  it ruled that President Bill Clinton could not evade a civil lawsuit brought by Paula Jones  a woman who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances  In 1974  it ruled against President Richard Nixon s bid to avoid handing over audiotapes and other material to a federal judge as part of a criminal investigation into the Watergate corruption scandal  During the impeachment trial  Trump s legal team argued for an unconstrained presidency  They also said that the charges brought by the House   abuse of power and contempt of Congress   did not cover conduct that amounted to impeachable offenses   They argued that if a president trying to win re election believes he is acting in the national interest  any quid pro quo   a Latin term meaning a favor for a favor   arrangement aimed at boosting his election chances cannot be impeachable  They also argued that an impeachable offense must be a violation of a statutory law  Democrats said this sweeping assessment of presidential power would embolden Trump and future presidents to act with impunity   EXTREME AND RIDICULOUS  It remains to be seen whether such arguments will win favor at the Supreme Court  whose 5 4 conservative majority includes two justices appointed by Trump   I doubt there s five votes for the more extreme and ridiculous arguments made by the president s lawyers in the Senate   said Ilya Somin  a professor at George Mason University s Antonin Scalia Law School in Virginia   Some of the Trump team s statements at the impeachment trial  Somin added   may damage their credibility   In the McGahn case  Trump administration lawyers argued that Congress cannot force a presidential aide to testify even in its usual oversight role  and that impeachment is the only real power Congress has to police a president s conduct  Trump directed current and former officials not to provide testimony or documents in the House impeachment inquiry   The aggressive position he  Trump  took in the impeachment trial could have an indirect impact in the courts   said Michael Stern  a former House lawyer when it was under Republican control  Trump lost in the lower courts in all three of the Supreme Court cases  Two involve Trump s bid to ward off congressional subpoenas issued to third parties   Trump s accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks   Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF    seeking his bank records  tax returns and other material  The other case involves a criminal investigation into Trump and his family real estate business in which Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance  a Democrat  is seeking the president s tax returns  The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June in the three cases  The Justice Department has argued that the House Judiciary Committee lacks legal standing to enforce its subpoena on McGahn and that senior presidential advisers are  absolutely immune  from being forced to testify to Congress about official acts  It also argued that federal courts lack the authority to referee such disputes between the legislative and executive branches of the U S  government

147540,369056,COF,From cat videos to credit cards  Amazon says customers have to secure own data,news,"By Jack Stubbs
LISBON  Reuters    Amazon s cloud computing customers have to decide themselves how best to protect sensitive information online  a senior executive said on Tuesday  following accusations by U S  lawmakers that the web giant has not done enough to secure data on its servers 
Amazon Web Services  AWS   the cloud computing arm of Amazon com  O AMZN   has come under fire following a series of high profile data breaches  including one this year involving the personal information of 106 million people stored on its servers by  Capital One  Financial Corp  N COF  
Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels said AWS provided multiple services to help customers identify if their data was being stored appropriately and flag any possible problems  but the decision about which settings to use lay with those clients 
 We feel we have a responsibility in making sure you take the right actions  but in the end it s only you who can decide what is the right action there and what s not   he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon 
 I m not going to look at your data thinking like  hey  these are cat videos  maybe you shouldn t do that    He added that customers should use tighter security controls for sensitive data such as credit card information 
Cybersecurity researchers say data hosted on AWS servers is often accidentally exposed due to mistakes made by the company s clients configuring their security settings 
The alleged Capital One hacker  for example  was able to access the firm s data due to a wrongly configured web application firewall  U S  prosecutors have said 
Analysts at Gartner predict client mistakes will account for 99 percent of  cloud security failures  over the next six years 
Vogels said the AWS system warned customers with a  massive red button  when they configured online storage containers   known as buckets   to be accessible by anyone online  a setting deliberately chosen for some products and applications 
The company also provides tools which clients can run to analyze the type of data they are storing and spot commonly associated slip ups  he said 
 If you  change  the configuration on your bucket to world readable  you will get lots of alarm bells going off   he said   It s up to the individual customer to decide what s right and what s wrong  ",2019-11-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/from-cat-videos-to-credit-cards-amazon-says-customers-have-to-secure-own-data-2012476,2012476
147541,369057,COF,Court tells banks to hand Trump financial records to House Democrats,news,"By Brendan Pierson and Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  appeals court on Tuesday handed President Donald Trump another defeat in his bid to keep his financial records secret  directing  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  N COF  to comply with subpoenas from congressional Democrats demanding the material  A three judge panel of the Manhattan based 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 1 against Trump s bid to block two House of Representatives committees from enforcing subpoenas issued in April to the two banks seeking the documents  Trump is expected to appeal the case to the U S  Supreme Court  The 2nd Circuit rejected Trump s arguments that Congress lacked a valid purpose for seeking his records and that disclosure of the material would compromise his and his family s privacy and distract the Republican president from his duties  The material sought by the committees include records of accounts  transactions and investments linked to Trump  his three oldest children  their immediate family members and several Trump Organization entities    The Committees  interests in pursuing their constitutional legislative function is a far more significant public interest than whatever public interest inheres in avoiding the risk of a Chief Executive s distraction arising from disclosure of documents reflecting his private financial transactions   Judge Jon Newman wrote in the ruling  Trump had sued the two banks in an effort to prevent the disclosure of his financial records  U S  District Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled in May that the subpoenas could be enforced  prompting Trump to appeal   We believe the subpoenas at issue are not valid   said Jay Sekulow  a lawyer for Trump   In light of the 2nd Circuit decision  we are evaluating our next options including seeking review at the Supreme Court of the United States   The Supreme Court s 5 4 conservative majority includes two justices appointed by Trump  Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the ruling  another victory for the rule of law  our constitution and our American democracy   Leaders of the two House panels that issued the subpoenas   Maxine Waters of the Financial Services Committee and Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee   said in a statement the ruling  ensures that a significant amount of the materials sought by our committees will continue to be produced   In separate legal cases  Trump also has sought to block House Democrats from obtaining his tax and financial records from his long time accounting firm  The subpoenas involved in Tuesday s ruling were issued months before House Democrats began an inquiry in September into whether there were grounds to impeach Trump over his request to Ukraine to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden  Trump  running for re election in 2020  has fought hard to keep his financial and tax records private  He broke with tradition by not releasing his tax returns as a candidate in 2016 and as president  A PRINCIPAL LENDER Germany s Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump s real estate business  A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least  130 million of liabilities to the bank    As we have said previously  we remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations   a Deutsche Bank spokesman said of Tuesday s decision  Capital One did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The House Financial Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump  three of his children and the Trump Organization  Lawmakers have said the requests are part of a wider investigation into money laundering and foreign influence over U S  politics   The Financial Services Committee subpoenaed Virginia based Capital One  seeking records related to the Trump Organization s hotel business  The two banks have said the records involved in the case do not include Trump s tax returns  Congressional investigators have already identified possible failures in Deutsche Bank s money laundering controls in its dealings with Russian oligarchs  people familiar with the matter have told Reuters  Judge Debra Ann Livingston dissented from the ruling  saying Trump and his family raised  serious constitutional questions  about congressional authority to enforce  deeply troubling  subpoenas seeking  voluminous  financial records  and deserved a chance to object to disclosure of more sensitive materials  Newman was appointed by President Jimmy Carter

147543,369059,COF,U S  Justice Ginsburg puts temporary hold on Trump financial records dispute,news,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday put a temporary hold on a court ruling that would require records held by  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  N COF  to be handed over to Democratic led congressional panels 
Trump s lawyers asked the high court to put a hold a Dec  3 ruling by Manhattan based 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals directing the two banks to comply with April subpoenas by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and Intelligence Committee for the financial records 
In a brief order  Ginsburg said that the lower court ruling is now on hold until Dec  13 
The material sought by the committees includes records of accounts  transactions and investments linked to Trump  his three oldest children  their immediate family members and several Trump Organization entities 
Trump filed an appeal to the Supreme Court on Thursday in a separate case seeking to prevent the House Oversight Committee from obtaining financial records from Mazars LLP  Trump s longtime accounting firm  An appeals court in Washington ruled against Trump in October 
The Supreme Court on Nov  25 granted Trump s request to put the subpoena enforcement in that case on hold while the president appeals the matter  Both cases represent an important showdown over the powers of the presidency versus those of Congress 
The lower court rulings  if left intact  would bring House Democrats closer to getting some of the details about Trump s business interests even as they pursue an impeachment inquiry focusing on his dealings with Ukraine 
Trump  running for re election in 2020  has fought to keep his financial and tax records private  He broke with tradition by not releasing his tax returns as a candidate in 2016 and as president 
Trump sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One in an effort to prevent the disclosure of his financial records  U S  District Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled in May that the subpoenas could be enforced  prompting Trump s to appeal to the 2nd Circuit 
Trump in November also asked the Supreme Court to reverse a separate appeals court ruling that directed Mazars to hand over his personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018 to local prosecutors in New York City  The justices are due to discuss on Dec  13 whether to hear Trump s appeal in that case 
In that same case  the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance  a Democrat  is seeking the returns as part of a criminal investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization  the president s family real estate business 
The court has a 5 4 conservative majority that includes two Trump appointees  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh

The breach at Capital One between March and July was revealed late last month and stemmed from Capital One s decision to store data in Amazon s cloud unit  called Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS   where a former employee named Paige Thompson managed to access its data 
Thompson s indictment cited more than 30 victims of data intrusion and theft  including Capital One  the DOJ said  adding that the case is now headed for a federal court in Seattle 
The DOJ did not identify other companies whose data was allegedly breached by Thompson  However  it mentioned that some of the victims included a state agency outside the state of Washington  a telecommunications conglomerate outside the United States and a public research university outside Washington 
Thompson not only stole data  but also used stolen computer power to mine cryptocurrency for her own benefit  a practice known as  cryptojacking   according to the indictment 
The 33 year old software engineer made her initial appearance in a federal court in July  She remains in custody and her charges in the indictment carry penalties of up to 25 years in prison  according to the statement

147568,369084,COF,U S  Supreme Court to tackle gay rights  guns  abortion and Trump,news,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court s new term opens on Monday with the conservative majority in a position to take a more aggressive rightward turn on divisive issues including abortion  gay rights and gun control while also refereeing legal brawls involving President Donald Trump 
The court has moved to the right since Trump took office  with a 5 4 conservative majority that includes two justices he appointed  Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 and Neil Gorsuch in 2017 
 We will likely see the court move further and faster in a rightward direction   said Irv Gornstein  executive director of Georgetown University Law Center s Supreme Court Institute 
The justices are due to tackle a larger number of consequential cases than they did in their previous term  and they could end up producing more 5 4 rulings along ideological lines with the conservative justices on the winning end and the four liberal justices in dissent  according to court experts 
There were few such rulings in the term that ended in June  In one of the biggest rulings of the last term  conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four liberals in blocking Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 U S  census that opponents called an effort to intimidate immigrants into not taking part in the decennial population count 
The nine justices on Tuesday will hear their first major case  on whether gay and transgender people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that bars employment discrimination 
On Nov  12  they will weigh the legality of Trump s move to end a program created by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants   mostly Hispanic young adults   who were brought into the United States illegally as children 
The court has arguments scheduled for Dec  2 in the first major gun rights case in decade  although the justices potentially could dismiss it because the New York City law being challenged by gun rights advocates has been amended since the litigation began  Other gun related cases wait in the wings for possible action by the justices

 A VEHICLE TO OVERRULE 
The court could announce as soon as this week whether it will take up two appeals regarding Republican backed abortion restrictions enacted in Louisiana and Indiana  If the court were to take either or both of those cases  it would raise the possibility of a ruling that curbs abortion rights  as hoped for by anti abortion activists 
The Louisiana case concerns a challenge by an abortion clinic to state requirements that doctors who perform the procedure have a difficult to obtain arrangement known as  admitting privileges  with local hospitals  It is similar to a Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016  when conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy sided with the court s liberals  Kennedy  who defended abortion rights in some pivotal rulings  retired last year and was replaced by Kavanaugh 
 If they take up the case they could use it as a vehicle to overrule their precedent from three years ago  That would be extraordinary  The only thing that s different is the composition of the court   said Julie Rikelman  a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights  which supports abortion rights 
The court during its new term also may be called upon to intervene on issues concerning Trump s personal conduct in office  including potential legal fights over congressional subpoenas for material in the ongoing impeachment drama in the Democratic led House of Representatives 
In 1974  the Supreme Court played a decisive role in the investigation into President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal  ruling 8 0 that Nixon had to hand over audio tapes recorded in the Oval Office  Facing impeachment  Nixon resigned days later 
Other disputes percolating in lower courts include lawsuits accusing Trump of violating anti corruption provisions in the U S  Constitution relating to his business interests  Two appeals courts have ruled on the issue so far  with one ruling for Trump and one against 
Trump is also fighting congressional subpoenas seeking his financial records from accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks   Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial  NYSE COF  Group 
Some legal experts have said that Trump  who has prevailed at the Supreme Court on issues such as his travel ban on people entering the United States from several Muslim majority countries  may not fare so well on cases focusing on his personal activities 
In the House approves articles of impeachment   formal charges against Trump   Roberts would assume a daunting responsibility  As required under the Constitution  the chief justice would preside over a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office 
The health of the court s oldest justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg  also could be an issue in the court s nine month term  which will culminate with a flurry of major rulings next June during the heat of the 2020 U S  presidential campaign 
The 86 year old Ginsburg  a justice since 1993  underwent radiation therapy in August to treat a cancerous tumor on her pancreas after having two cancerous nodules in her left lung removed last December  Ginsburg has made public appearances since her latest treatment and has said she is  on my way to being very well  
Ginsburg s health concerns raise the possibility of Trump making another appointment to the Supreme Court  In addition  another liberal justice  Stephen Breyer  turned 81 in August 
 I can safely predict that the new term will have a fair share of closely watched cases and I look forward to the challenges ahead   Ginsburg said during a Sept  12 appearance in Washington ",2019-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-supreme-court-to-tackle-gay-rights-guns-abortion-and-trump-1991331,1991331

147594,369110,COF,Two Democratic senators question Pentagon delay on cloud contract,news,"By Bryan Pietsch
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two Democratic senators asked U S  Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Monday if  outside  influence caused him to delay awarding a  10 billion cloud computing contract  after President Donald Trump suggested Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  should not win it 
The contract  called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud  or JEDI  is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon s information technology systems 
Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked Esper in a letter why the Defense Department was reviewing the contract and if Esper was directed by someone outside of the Pentagon to delay or cancel the contract  which was in final talks with Amazon Web Services  The senators publicly released a copy of the letter 
Trump in July said his administration was examining Amazon s bid following complaints from other tech companies 
Warner had raised his concerns about the decision to put a hold on the contract in a tweet on Friday  saying that  for the President to use the power of his office to punish critics in the media would be a complete abuse of power  
Jeff Bezos  the founder and chief executive of Amazon  also owns the Washington Post  which Trump has repeatedly accused of unfair coverage 
The request from the two senators comes the same day that Democratic Senator Ron Wyden asked Bezos if Amazon Web Services  may have contributed to  a recent massive data breach of  Capital One  Financial Corp s  N COF  servers 
Wyden suggested a default server setting in Amazon s cloud computing products could have been exploited in recent hacks  citing cybersecurity experts  and asked Bezos how those attacks could be  identified and mitigated  
Amazon did not immediately respond to request for comment 
Wyden joins Republican members of the U S House of Representatives Oversight Committee who asked Amazon on Thursday to be briefed about the company s security protocols in light of the breach ",2019-08-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/two-democratic-senators-question-pentagon-delay-on-cloud-contract-1946378,1946378

147597,369113,COF,Deutsche Bank says records sought in Trump congressional probe include tax returns,news,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK  Reuters    Financial records related to U S  President Donald Trump and three of his children that congressional Democrats have requested from  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  include tax returns  the bank disclosed in a court filing on Tuesday 
Two committees in the U S  House of Representatives subpoenaed Deutsche Bank in April to provide financial records belonging to the president and his children Donald Trump Jr   Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump 
Deutsche Bank s filing  in the 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  revealed that it had tax returns that it would need to hand over if it complied with the subpoenas  which the Trumps are seeking to block  It was not clear whose tax returns it had  because names were redacted from the filing 
A lawyer for the Trumps could not immediately be reached for comment  Deutsche Bank declined to comment 
The disclosure comes as Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee are seeking to obtain Trump s personal and business tax returns  which the president has refused to turn over  from the Treasury Department 
Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump s real estate business  A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least  130 million of liabilities to the bank 
The subpoenas on Deutsche Bank  issued by the House Financial Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee  seek records of accounts  transactions and investments linked to Trump and the three named children  their immediate family members and several Trump Organization entities  including records of possible ties to foreign entities 
Deutsche Bank said in Tuesday s filing that it also had tax returns for people who  may constitute  immediate family   as defined by the subpoenas  without giving any names 
A lawyer for the Trumps last week urged the 2nd Circuit to block the bank from handing over the records  saying Congress did not have the authority to demand them  The court has not yet ruled on the case 
The Trumps are also seeking to block a separate subpoena served by the Financial Services Committee on  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF  seeks records related to the Trump Organization s hotel business 
Capital One said in a court filing on Tuesday that it did not have any tax returns related to the subpoena  The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment

147599,369115,COF,U S  jury indicts suspected Capital One hacker on wire fraud  data theft charges,news," Reuters    A federal grand jury has indicted the suspected hacker who obtained personal information of over 100 million people in the  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF  data breach on charges of wire fraud and computer data theft  the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  said on Wednesday 
The breach at Capital One between March and July was revealed late last month and stemmed from Capital One s decision to store data in Amazon s cloud unit  called Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS   where a former employee named Paige Thompson managed to access its data 
Thompson s indictment cited more than 30 victims of data intrusion and theft  including Capital One  the DOJ said  adding that the case is now headed for a federal court in Seattle 
The DOJ did not identify other companies whose data was allegedly breached by Thompson  However  it mentioned that some of the victims included a state agency outside the state of Washington  a telecommunications conglomerate outside the United States and a public research university outside Washington 
Thompson not only stole data  but also used stolen computer power to mine cryptocurrency for her own benefit  a practice known as  cryptojacking   according to the indictment 
The 33 year old software engineer made her initial appearance in a federal court in July  She remains in custody and her charges in the indictment carry penalties of up to 25 years in prison  according to the statement 




The data breach at Capital One resulted in the exposure of names and addresses of customers  the company said last month  The hacker did not gain access to credit card account numbers  but about 140 000 Social Security numbers and 80 000 linked bank account numbers were compromised ",2019-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/us-jury-indicts-suspected-capital-one-hacker-on-wire-fraud-data-theft-charges-1967042,1967042
147621,369137,COF,Factbox  Clash between Trump  U S  House Democrats shifts into courts,news," Reuters    U S  House Democrats this week sued the Trump administration to demand President Donald Trump s individual and business tax returns after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a legal request and defied two congressional subpoenas 
The House Ways and Means Committee lawsuit is the latest action as the Democratically controlled chamber pursues multiple investigations into the Republican president  his family and businesses 
Some of the House Democrats  probes  which cover Russian interference  security clearances and Trump s finances among other issues  are beginning to move from Capitol Hill to the U S  courts  Democrats say their probes are needed to hold to account a president who scorns respect for the law and governing norms 
Trump and most of his fellow Republicans dismiss the Democrats  inquiries as grandstanding or political harassment  Trump and his advisers run the legal risk of contempt of Congress citations and court enforcement actions that could result in fines 
Here are some of the conflicts between Congress and Trump that are being litigated or could end up in court 
TAX RETURNS
Unlike past presidents in recent decades  Trump refuses to make public his tax returns  raising questions about what is in them  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has defied a subpoena from the House tax committee seeking six years of Trump s past individual and business tax returns 
The House Ways and Means panel  led by Richard Neal  sued the U S  Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service on July 2 to enforce the subpoena  Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said the administration would file its response in court 
Trump s Justice Department said in a June 14 legal opinion that Mnuchin did not violate the law by refusing to turn over the tax returns  A judge could opt to ignore that Justice Department memo in the event of a legal battle 
MAZARS ACCOUNTING FIRM
In a win for House Democrats  a federal judge on May 20 said Mazars LLP  Trump s long time accounting firm  should hand over Trump s financial records to congressional investigators 
Lawyers for Trump asserted that a subpoena seeking the records was unlawful because Congress was improperly taking on a law enforcement role 
Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said they needed the documents to examine whether Trump faces conflicts of interest or broke the law by not disentangling himself from his businesses as previous presidents have done 
Trump called the judge s decision  crazy  and appealed  An appeals court will hold an oral argument on July 12 
DEUTSCHE BANK  CAPITAL ONE
Another judge ruled against Trump in a similar case involving banks that Trump did business with    Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial  NYSE COF  
Two House committees sent subpoenas to the banks and  as in the Mazars case  Trump sued to try to block them  arguing that the committees were reaching beyond their legislative role 
U S  District Judge Edgardo Ramos in New York said Congress has the legal authority to demand the records  clearing the way for the banks to comply with the subpoenas 
The Deutsche Bank subpoena seeks accounts  transactions and investments linked to Trump  his three oldest children  their immediate family and several Trump Organization entities  as well as records of ties they might have to foreign entities 
Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump s real estate business  A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least  130 million of liabilities to the bank 
The Capital One subpoena seeks records related to the Trump Organization s hotel business  which some Democrats have argued raises potential conflicts of interest 
An appeals court will hold oral arguments in August 
MUELLER REPORT
Attorney General William Barr released a redacted version on April 18 of a report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U S  election in Trump s favor and Trump s attempt to impede that probe 
The redactions left unanswered some key questions about Mueller s probe  Seeking answers  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has subpoenaed the unredacted report and the evidence that Mueller relied on 
The White House has asserted the seldom used principle of executive privilege to keep the full Mueller report under wraps 
On June 10  Nadler cut a deal with Barr to allow committee members to view some of the materials they want  avoiding a court showdown  But Nadler said he would not rule out suing Barr if the Justice Department does not continue to cooperate 
A similar May 22 agreement gave the House Intelligence Committee access to counterintelligence materials underlying Mueller s report 
Mueller is scheduled to testify about his report on July 17 
CENSUS AND CITIZENSHIP
Trump on June 12 asserted executive privilege to keep under wraps documents related to his administration s push to add a citizenship question to the census  defying a subpoena from the Democratic led House Oversight Committee 
That same day  the committee voted to recommend the full House find Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for their refusal to produce the documents  The committee moved to seek a contempt citation against the two in a June 25 report 
Separately  a group of states and immigration rights organizations had challenged the citizenship question in a case that reached the U S  Supreme Court  The nation s top court ruled June 27 against the Trump administration in a decision that Trump rejected 
EMOLUMENTS
In 2017  a group of congressional Democrats sued Trump in Washington for allegedly accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments through his businesses  a violation of the anti corruption Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution 
In June  U S  District Judge Emmet Sullivan rejected a request by Trump administration lawyers to halt the case and let them file an expedited appeal of key preliminary rulings he issued against the president  The judge had earlier denied Trump s request to dismiss the case 
A similar case  filed by the Democratic attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Maryland  is making its way through the courts  An appeals court heard oral arguments in March over whether that case should have been allowed to proceed 
The Justice Department has argued Democrats are reading the Emoluments Clauses too broadly and that there is nothing new or illegal about a president engaging in commercial transactions 
EX WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL MCGAHN
Nadler has said he may begin legal proceedings to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee s probe into whether Trump obstructed justice  McGahn failed to show up to testify at a May 21 hearing  having been told by the White House not to produce documents in response to a committee subpoena 
McGahn was the most cited witness in Mueller s report  recounting Trump s efforts to interfere with the investigation 
The House approved a measure on June 11 that authorized Nadler to take legal action to enforce the subpoena to McGahn  Annie Donaldson  McGahn s former chief of staff  has agreed to testify ",2019-07-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/factbox-clash-between-trump-us-house-democrats-shifts-into-courts-1914885,1914885

inquiries as grandstanding or political harassment  The Democrats  who control the House of Representatives  say the investigations are needed to hold to account a president who scorns respect for the law and governing norms  In most of the disputes  Trump and his advisers run the legal risk of contempt of Congress citations and court enforcement actions that could result in fines  Here are some of the conflicts between Congress and Trump that are being litigated or could end up in court   MAZARS ACCOUNTING FIRM In a win for House Democrats  a federal judge on May 20 said Mazars LLP  Trump s long time accounting firm  should hand over Trump s financial records to congressional investigators   Lawyers for Trump asserted that a subpoena seeking the records was unlawful because Congress was

147655,369171,COF,As legal glare turns to Trump  his faith in Supreme Court may be tested,news,"By Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s fondness for the U S  Supreme Court could be tested by a series of legal disputes targeting him personally   from his taxes and businesses to his 2016 election campaign   that ultimately may be decided by the justices  Trump has viewed the court  whose 5 4 conservative majority includes two justices he appointed  as friendly territory  unlike certain lower courts and individual judges he has publicly criticized after ending up on the wrong side of rulings  The Supreme Court already has given the Republican president victories on some pivotal policies including upholding his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim majority countries  But as the focus of some of the major legal challenges shifts from his policies to Trump himself  there could be disappointments in store for him  according to some legal experts  in particular if the Supreme Court stoutly defends the ability of Congress to pursue investigations of the president  The conservative justices  won t feel any loyalty to Trump  but will instead support strong separation of powers  as delineated in the U S  Constitution assigning specific roles to the government s executive  legislative and judicial branches  said conservative legal scholar J W  Verret  an expert in corporate and securities law at George Mason University in Virginia    That means upholding lower court decisions finding proper legislative purpose in recent inquiries regarding tax and financial fraud subpoenas   Verret added   Trump  who is seeking re election in 2020  and his administration have defied a series of subpoenas coming from the Democratic led House of Representatives  The subpoenas have sought testimony from current and former administration officials as well as documents covering matters such as his tax returns  banking records  family business interests and Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump s actions to impede the inquiry  The president and his lawyers have defiantly challenged the oversight authority of Congress  a stance that Democrats have framed as an attack on the separation of powers  Trump has sued to try to block enforcement of certain subpoenas  losing thus far in lower courts  And House Democrats  who are divided on whether to launch the impeachment process set out in the Constitution to remove a president from office  appear poised to press the matter by bringing their own court actions to try to enforce their subpoenas   Other lawsuits  including one brought by congressional Democrats  also accuse Trump of violating an anti corruption provision in the Constitution  called the emoluments clause  by continuing to accept payments from foreign governments through his businesses including a downtown Washington hotel   Some of Trump s losses in lower courts already are on appeal  and potentially could come before the Supreme Court with decisions issued during the heat of the election season  Stuart Gerson  a Republican former Justice Department official and former acting U S  attorney general  said the Supreme Court might be skeptical if the aim of subpoenas by Democratic lawmakers is merely to  educate the American people and build up a tide for impeachment that doesn t exist now    There s no black and white   Gerson added   It will be  win some  lose some   and the Supreme Court  I think  given its precedent  will define a middle ground   William Consovoy  Trump s lead lawyer on cases involving his business dealings  did not respond to a request seeking comment  The White House declined to comment for this story  SUPREME INFATUATION Trump has professed his faith in the Supreme Court and the importance of a president s role in making lifetime appointments to the top U S  judicial body  Trump has said his promise to name conservative justices was a  main reason  why he was elected in 2016  His two appointees  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh  have deepened the conservative hold on the court  Aside from the travel ban  Trump s policy victories at the Supreme Court have included implementation of his ban on most transgender people in the U S  military and blocking Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from being deposed in a lawsuit over the contentious plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census  His administration has sought to bypass lower courts by rushing certain appeals of adverse rulings to the high court  Trump s lawyers have justified stonewalling subpoenas by arguing that the Democratic demands exceed congressional authority  are overly broad or improperly invade Trump s private affairs  Federal judges have rejected those arguments  citing Supreme Court precedent that Congress has broad authority to investigate corruption or improper conduct in the workings of government  If federal appeals courts uphold judges  rulings that side with Congress  Verret predicted the Supreme Court would deliver  either a 9 0 outcome in support  of the lower courts or would simply refuse to hear the administration s appeal  leaving the lower court rulings intact   This goes to precedent involving core congressional oversight power   Verret added  So long as they do not impede a president s duties  demands from Congress for documents that could cause embarrassment or political problems do not provide legal grounds to refuse to comply  added William Ross  who teaches constitutional law at Samford University in Alabama   The Supreme Court s first taste of the fight between Trump and congressional Democratic could come in two fast moving cases  Trump is trying to block subpoenas for financial records that were issued to his accounting firm  Mazars LLP  and two banks with which he has done business   Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF   Judges in Washington and New York  respectively  ruled that the subpoenas could be enforced  Trump has appealed in both cases and could seek to bring them to the Supreme Court if he keeps

147678,369194,COF,Escalating fight  Trump sues Deutsche Bank  Capital One over Democratic subpoenas,news,"By Rich McKay  Reuters    President Donald Trump  his three oldest children and the Trump Organization have sued  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF  to try to block them from responding to U S  congressional subpoenas issued by Democrats seeking financial records  The lawsuit filed late Monday opens a new front in Trump s battle to stop the Democratic led House of Representatives from probing the Republican president  his family  his businesses and his administration after Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his inquiry into Russia s role in the 2016 election  The lawsuit said urgent action was necessary because both banks signaled they would begin responding to the subpoenas unless a court intervened by May 6  Deutsche Bank has long been one of the main banks for Trump s real estate empire  Democratic lawmakers  meanwhile  asked Capital One s chief executive in March for documents related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump s hotel in downtown Washington and other business interests   In the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court  Trump  his adult children Donald Jr   Eric and Ivanka  and the Trump Organization accused House leaders of pursuing records for no legitimate or lawful purpose  hoping they would  stumble upon something  they could use as a political weapon against Trump   The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J  Trump  to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances  his businesses  and the private information of the President and his family   the complaint said  Only the banks were named as defendants  Representative Maxine Waters  who chairs the House Financial Services Committee  and Representative Adam Schiff  who chairs the House Intelligence Committee  said on April 15 their panels had issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump s finances   The president will do anything and everything that he can to obstruct justice     to shut down an investigation   Waters told reporters on Capitol Hill  She also said Trump has  cast a gauntlet and he has said that he is going to fight   referring to her investigation of Deutsche Bank   We will fight him   Waters added  Deutsche Bank said it was  committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations   Capital One was not immediately available for comment  Lawyers for the plaintiffs were also not immediately available  The case was assigned to U S  District Judge Edgardo Ramos  an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama  Michael Stern  who served as senior House counsel from 1996 to 2004  said the lawsuit was unlikely to succeed because judges do not like second guessing lawmakers  motivations in investigations  Stern also said Trump s decision to sue only Deutsche Bank and Capital One appears to have been strategic because the banks would not try to pick sides and were less likely to contest an injunction blocking a subpoena  Andy Wright  a former White House lawyer under Obama now at the law firm K L Gates  said   Courts have been really reluctant to assess whether or not Congress has a legitimate interest or not  They have been very deferential in the past    DEFYING LAWMAKERS Trump  who is seeking re election next year  has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January  including possible dealings with Russia  and said  we re fighting all the subpoenas  issued by the House  That battle could herald a major showdown between the executive and legislative branches testing the separation of powers spelled out in the U S  Constitution  The White House is also resisting other House subpoenas  including for Trump s personal and business tax returns  and sought to block current and former administration officials from cooperating with House investigators  Waters and Schiff in a joint statement called the lawsuit part of Trump s  unprecedented stonewalling  of congressional oversight  In the complaint  the plaintiffs said House leaders ignored constitutional limits on Congress  power to investigate  and any probe needed to further some  legitimate legislative purpose  and could not be an end in itself  They also said the subpoenas violated the plaintiffs  privacy rights  and the refusal of House committees to even provide copies of the subpoenas to the plaintiffs made it impossible to know  or negotiate  their scope or breadth  Deutsche Bank stood almost alone in extending credit and managing money for Trump before he became president  as other banks avoided him because of his poor track record in paying back loans  The German lender has extended a substantial amount of capital to the Trump Organization in the past decade  according to documents and media reports  A 2017 financial disclosure form showed that Trump had at least  130 million of liabilities to Deutsche Bank

147680,369196,COF,White House defies Congress on McGahn subpoena as Trump battles Democrats,news,"By Steve Holland and David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s struggle with Democratic lawmakers intensified on Tuesday  with the White House directing former counsel Don McGahn not to comply with a congressional subpoena and the chair of the House Judiciary Committee threatening to hold him in contempt  McGahn  who left his post as White House counsel last year  was directed not to produce White House records related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia inquiry that are being sought by the House panel  said Pat Cipollone  the current White House counsel  Separately  the Justice Department on Tuesday also threatened to advise Trump to invoke executive privilege over the entire unredacted Mueller report if House Democrats did not back down from a plan to hold Barr in contempt  Both incidents are the latest episodes in an escalating fight between the Republican president and Democrats  who control the House of Representatives and are seeking documents and testimony relating to various investigations  ahead of the 2020 presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second four year term   Cipollone said in a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler that McGahn was given the documents during the investigation  with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes    The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles  because they implicate significant executive branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege   Cipollone wrote  Executive privilege is a right claimed by presidents to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government  Nadler responded late in the day with a letter to McGahn s personal attorney  noting the White House had not invoked executive privilege over the documents and that the Judiciary Committee still expected McGahn to comply with its subpoena   I fully expect that the committee will hold Mr  McGahn in contempt if he fails to appear before the Committee  unless the White House secures a court order directing otherwise   Nadler wrote  Nadler had asked McGahn to produce the documents by Tuesday morning  The committee also subpoenaed McGahn to testify at a deposition  Neither committee officials nor McGahn s lawyer were immediately available to comment on whether he would do so    Because Mr  McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties  I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House  the appropriate legal custodian   Cipollone said  CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION House Democrats have sought McGahn s cooperation as part of their investigation of possible corruption and obstruction of justice by Trump  Trump denies wrongdoing   Mueller s 448 page report referred to conversations in June 2017 in which Trump called McGahn to tell him he should direct Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  who was overseeing the special counsel s probe  to remove Mueller because of alleged conflicts of interest   The report cited  McGahn s clear recollection  that the president directed him to tell Rosenstein that  Mueller has to go   McGahn did not carry out Trump s order  the report said   Trump also tried unsuccessfully to get McGahn to dispute media reports that the president had attempted to fire Mueller  the report said  Trump is fighting congressional Democrats on several fronts  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a request by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal for Trump s tax returns  The House Judiciary Committee has set a vote for Wednesday on whether to cite Attorney General William Barr with contempt of Congress over his refusal to provide it with a full  unredacted version of Mueller s report that the Democrats have since subpoenaed   In the face of the committee s threatened contempt vote  the Attorney General will be compelled to request that the President invoke executive privilege with respect to the materials subject to the subpoena   Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote in a May 7 letter to Nadler seen by Reuters late on Tuesday night  A U S  House Democratic aide said the vote is still set for Wednesday  and that Democrats had earlier tried to negotiate with the department in order to avoid the a contempt citation  Meanwhile  Trump  his three oldest children and the Trump Organization also have sued  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF  to try to block them from responding to U S  congressional subpoenas issued by Democrats seeking financial records  Republicans in Congress have rejected the efforts of Democratic led House committees as political gamesmanship intended to appeal to the Democratic Party s voting base ahead of the 2020 election  In a statement late on Tuesday  House Judiciary Committee Ranking Republican Doug Collins blasted Nadler for rejecting offers by the Justice Department to let Democrats see a lesser redacted version of Mueller report  
 It appears that the more access to information Democrats receive  the less interested they are in actually examining those facts   Collins said ",2019-05-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/white-house-to-tell-former-counsel-not-to-comply-with-house-subpoena-abc-1859167,1859167

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 19 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  195  which places it at the bottom 23  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates underperformance in the near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of weak earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 3 2  downward Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Underperforms Sector and S P 500The Zacks Consumer Loans industry has underperformed both the Zacks S P 500 composite and its own sector over the past three years While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 1 8  over this period  the Zacks S P 500 composite and the Zacks Finance sector have rallied 44 9  and 16   respectively  Three Year Price Performance
 
Industry s ValuationOn the basis of price to tangible book ratio  P TBV   which is commonly used for valuing consumer loan providers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next  the industry currently trades at 1 12X  This compares to the highest level of 1 55X and median of 0 96X over the past five years This compares with the S P 500 s trailing 12 month P TBV of 12 50X  as the chart below shows Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
As finance stocks typically have a lower P TBV ratio  comparing consumer loan providers with the S P 500 may not make sense to many investors  But a comparison of the group s P TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount  The Zacks Finance sector s trailing 12 month P TBV of 3 28X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry s ratio  as the chart below shows Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
Bottom LineThough consumer loan stocks are likely to continue benefiting from increasing loan demand  digitization of operations and improving economy  lower interest rates pose a major near term concern  This is expected to hurt top line growth to some extent  Also  easing lending standards are likely to lead to a rise in credit costs and delinquency rates Despite these concerns  one can have a look at the consumer loan stocks that depict an upbeat earnings outlook We are presenting one stock with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and two stocks with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that investors may consider betting on You can see  Elevate Credit  Inc   ELVT   The stock of this Fort Worth  TX based company has rallied 7 3  over the past six months  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings suggests growth of 21 3  on a year over year basis  The stock sports a Zacks Rank  1 Price and Consensus  ELVT

For the last reported quarter  Capital One came out with earnings of  3 37 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 84 per share  representing a surprise of 18 66   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 68 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 90 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 21  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Capital One  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Capital One has an Earnings ESP of  3 60  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 24  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-capital-one-cof-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200471937,200471937
147743,369259,COF,Earnings Preview  Capital One  COF  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Capital One  COF  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8  
Revenues are expected to be  7 18 billion  up 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 73  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Capital One 
For Capital One  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Capital One will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Capital One would post earnings of  2 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 37  delivering a surprise of  18 66  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Capital One doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-capital-one-cof-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200474663,200474663

security linked bank details were also stolen Analysts estimate that the company would now end up paying anything between  100 million and  500 million in fines for the incident  Over the past two years  we find that data breach incidents have been on the rise  Though unfortunate  incidents such as these buoy gains for cybersecurity companies due to an increased need for software to shield

authentication of an agent s identity Experts are also speculating that the DoD has been trying to create a code  which cannot be hacked and would therefore be used in securing defense databases  Further  in order to improvise the computing capability of the country  the DoD has been replacing its old hardware and cryptographic systems 4 Stocks to Watch ForThe increasing need to secure cloud

147769,369285,COF,Capital One  COF  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Capital One  COF  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Capital One is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Capital One imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions

147800,369316,COF,Fed s Quarles Draws Regulatory Road Map to Ease Bank Rules,news," Bloomberg     Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Randal Quarles  the central bank s supervision chief  shared a laundry list of ways to make regulation less burdensome for Wall Street    including streamlining capital rules  overhauling post crisis trading limits and making major changes to how the agency conducts stress tests 
 Confusion that results from overly complex regulation does not advance the goal of a safe system   Quarles said Friday at an American Bar Association conference in Washington 
In a wide ranging speech  the former  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  executive set an ambitious agenda  including a mission to reduce complexity in how banks prepare to weather future crises 
 While I am advocating a simplification of large bank loss absorbency requirements  I am not advocating an enervation of the regulatory capital regime   said Quarles  who has given few public speeches since he joined the Fed in October 
In what may be the most urgent item on his agenda  he said  the Fed is finishing its  near term  effort to rewrite big bank leverage limits  The central bank has been working with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on a leverage ratio proposal that would reduce capital demands on some Wall Street firms  people familiar with the effort have said 
Reviewing Rules
Quarles signaled that he is embracing a mission to review and revise many of the rules the Fed enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis 
A major target is the Volcker Rule  which restricts banks  ability to invest on their own behalf  Quarles said the five agencies that approved the rule in 2013 have been back at work crafting a new version  He called it  a quite comprehensive and substantial undertaking  that won t be completed soon 
One particularly ambitious objective will be welcomed by lenders such as US Bancorp  NYSE USB  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF   Quarles said he favors further  tailoring  rules to go easier on banks that are less complex than the Wall Street giants  He said that he supports Congress raising the  50 billion asset floor for banks to face the toughest rules  and that he further wants the Fed to make regulations  meaningfully less strict  for regional banks 
 Meaningful Simplification 
Quarles also offered ideas that will please the biggest financial firms  He said he wants a  meaningful simplification  of steps banks must take to ensure they can absorb losses  That would include revising a rule that requires bank holding companies to maintain a supply of long term debt that could be used for recovery and recapitalization after a failure 
He also addressed two of Wall Street s biggest headaches  living wills and stress tests  For the living wills    resolution plans banks must submit to show they can go through bankruptcy without shaking the financial system    Quarles called for a  permanent extension  of deadlines from annual to every two years  while also suggesting a reduced burden for midsize lenders  For stress tests  he said the Fed may eliminate at least one of the capital ratios it measures  and he wants to reveal more information on how banks are assessed 
 The disclosure we have provided does not go far enough to provide visibility into the supervisory models that often deliver a firm s binding capital constraint   he said 
The Fed said last month that it s planning to put out a lot more information about the stress tests  That s been a major lobbying point for Wall Street banks  which have said the lack of clarity on what the regulator is evaluating has hurt their ability to prepare for the tests 
 The Federal Reserve and our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the better part of the past decade building out and standing up the post crisis regulatory regime   Quarles said   Now is an eminently natural and expected time to step back and assess those efforts

147828,369344,COF,No Easy Fix For Europe s Lenders As Deutsche Bank  Commerzbank Scrap Merger,opinion,"Germany s two biggest lenders  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn    NYSE DB  and Commerzbank  DE CBKG    OTC CRZBY  called off negotiations regarding a potential merger last week  signaling that troubles in Europe s banking sector run too deep for any easy remedies 
After six weeks of talks  the global banks said they concluded that the expected benefits of a combination would not justify the  additional execution risks  restructuring costs and capital requirements associated with such a large scale integration   The two lenders are emblematic of everything that s wrong with Europe s ailing banking industry deep seated structural problems  high costs relative to revenue  low profitability  threat to market share from aggressive U S  rivals and a lack of answers to competition from fintech companies 
 Deutsche s biggest problem remains its cost base  which remains well above a lot of its comparable peers  along with outdated IT systems   Michael Hewson  chief market analyst  at CMC Markets  a London based brokerage  said by e mail on Friday   Quite simply the problems facing Deutsche are still too large to make it a compelling takeover partner  let alone a merger partner  

Deutsche on Friday reported a 9  drop in first quarter revenue from a year earlier to 6 35 billion euros   7 08 billion   This was the ninth consecutive quarter of falling revenue  which also prompted Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing to cut the lender s 2019 revenue outlook  Just last month the bank forecasted a slight increase in revenue  but on Friday they revised that to  essentially flat  
Profit before taxes fell 32  to 292 million euros   326 03 million  from 432 million euros   482 35 million  in the same quarter last year  Revenue at the corporate and investment bank division fell 13   driven mainly by a slip in earnings from fixed income and equities  which dropped 19  and 18   respectively  The numbers  highlight how the bank is fighting a losing battle to turn itself around   according to Hewson 
Deutsche is still reeling from several scandals  including a  7 2 billion settlement with the U S  Department of Justice in a case related to the sale of mortgage backed securities in the lead up to the global financial crisis  As well  the bank faces fines  legal action and the possible prosecution of  senior management  because of its role in a  20bn Russian money laundering scheme  Britain s Guardian newspaper reported last month  citing a confidential internal report 
In addition  multiple U S  government authorities  including the U S  s House Intelligence and Financial Services committees as well as the House s Ways and Means committee  plus New York state legal authorities are looking into the bank s record on loans to President Donald Trump s family owned business the Trump Organization  Adding to this particular set of headwinds  yesterday  Trump  his children and his real estate businesses filed a federal suit to block Deutsche Bank  and Capital One Financial  NYSE COF   from complying with the congressional subpoenas  calling them a form of harassment 
As for Commerzbank  the German government still owns a 15  stake  after a 2009 bailout  Profitability is pressured by toxic assets  including a 8 4 billion euro portfolio   9 38 billion  of risky Italian government debt 

Though Deutsche bank managed to turn a small annual profit last year  its first in four years  Commerzbank s returns have remained subdued  Shares of both lenders have lost more than a third of their value in the past year  Over the past decade the declines are more than 80  
Investors reckon the shares are worth less than each company s liquidation value  Deutsche s shares have been trading at about a quarter of its book value  Commerzbank s at about a third 
Collective Market Cap of European Lenders Shrivels
The two German financial institutions aren t unique either  Last year the collective market cap of European lenders shrank by 330 billion euros   368 46 billion   Indeed  at this point  most major European banks trade at less than their book value 
As a group  they are valued at just 60  of their net assets compared with a 10  premium for major U S  peers  according to Bloomberg data  cited by Stephen Pope  managing partner at Spotlight Ideas  in a Forbes post  One reason for the underperformance is that Europe s banking market is overcrowded  leading to declining profitability 
This  combined with outdated business models  the persistence of negative rates and political uncertainty resulting from Brexit and the rise of populism  is the source of the European banking industry s troubles  according to Pope 

The STOXX Banks EUR Price has lost 22  over the past 12 months  Despite the tempting valuations  most European banking stocks may be better left for risk savvy investors

147830,369346,COF,Can Value Investors Consider Capital One  COF  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Capital One Financial Corporation   NYSE COF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Capital One has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 17  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 13  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Capital One s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 10 72 over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 75  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Moreover  Capital One has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 7 74  which is lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a more value oriented path may be ahead for Southern  NYSE SO  First stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Capital One has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 07x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Capital One currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Capital One a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Capital One might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives COF a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two upward revision versus six downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the full year estimates have seen five upward and three downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 2 4  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has shot up 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Capital One Financial Corporation Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCapital One is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a very strong industry rank  among Top 7  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the rank and industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get

147831,369347,COF,Banks  Capital Plans Approved  Shareholders To Get Wealthier,opinion,"In a vote of confidence for the banking industry  the Federal Reserve has approved the capital plans of all the 18 financial institutions  including the U S  units of foreign banks with  50 billion or more in total consolidated assets   This time  payouts  in terms of quarterly dividend and share buybacks  are expected to get bigger  with the same likely to exceed the projected earnings for a few banks However  there was a slight scare for JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   and Capital One   NYSE COF   as they had to alter and resubmit capital plans to remain above the Fed s regulatory minimum capital levels  Besides  the U S  unit of Credit Suisse   NYSE CS   received the conditional approval  with the bank requiring  to address certain limited weaknesses in its capital planning processes  by Oct 27 Surprisingly  Deutsche Bank s   NYSE DB   U S  unit also received approval for its capital plan  This will provide substantial boost to the financials of the bank  which has been facing several concerns  Earlier in 2015  2016 and 2018  the unit s plan was rejected by the Fed Following the approval  most of the banks announced their 2019 capital plans  As we see in the table below  there will be a significant improvement in shareholder value 
The capital plan approval and subsequent expectation of substantial increase in payouts cheered investors  with stocks of almost all the participating financial institutions ending the day in green  This positive development may boost the bank stocks  which have been trailing the broader markets amid several concerns  including the Fed s stance on interest rates and assumption of economic slowdown The Annual ExerciseCapital plan approval is part of the annual exercise conducted in two stages by the Fed  authorized under the Dodd Frank financial services law  to assess the resilience of the banking industry  In its 10th year of implementation  the process has helped the banking industry to significantly raise capital levels Per the Fed statement   the largest and most complex banks have more than doubled their common equity capital from around  300 billion to roughly  800 billion  this year During the 2008 financial crisis  big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed  while several others were on the verge of a meltdown  So  the U S  government had to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling This year s stress test was the toughest  with severe adverse scenarios featuring a severe global recession and a steeper downturn in the U S  economy  Further  the 10 year Treasury declined to a trough of around 0 75   Also  in equities  the banks were required to factor in substantially more volatility  with the U S  Market Volatility Index reaching 70  Additionally  the scenario included the U S  unemployment rate increasing to 6 10  along with slump in real estate prices and heightened stress in corporate loan markets  Under this hypothetical scenario  these banks will incur a loss of  410 million  narrower than total losses of  464 billion projected in the worst case hypothetical scenario for the 18 firms in 2018 Notably  the Common Equity Tier 1  CET1  capital ratio  in aggregate  would fall to a low of 9 2  from an actual 12 3  in fourth quarter 2018  The figure is well above the 4 5  minimum mark set by regulators Road AheadThis year  only financial institutions with assets of more than  250 billion were the part of this annual process  Earlier in February 2019  the central bank had excepted banks with assets between  100 billion and  250 billion from 2019 supervisory stress test  These banks will be required to undertake supervisory stress test alternate year  beginning 2020 Big banks will have to undergo this two stage process annually to get approval for their yearly capital deployments and for enhancing shareholder value  Further  the Fed s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will help banks attract more investments Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-06-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/banks-capital-plans-approved-shareholders-to-get-wealthier-200435668,200435668
147832,369348,COF,Analysts Estimate Capital One  COF  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Capital One  COF  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 8  
Revenues are expected to be  7 billion  down 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 43  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Capital One 
For Capital One  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Capital One will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Capital One would post earnings of  2 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 90  delivering a surprise of  8 21  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Capital One doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-capital-one-cof-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200439001,200439001

147835,369351,COF,Senate reaches deal to cut number of systemically important banks,news,"By Michelle Price and Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters    A bipartisan group of U S  senators said on Monday they had reached a tentative deal to cut the number of banks labeled systemically risky  in a major step forward for efforts to roll back regulations enacted following the 2008 financial crisis  The bill would exempt banks with less than  250 billion in assets   including BB T  NYSE BBT   SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI  and  American Express   NYSE AXP    from heightened regulatory scrutiny  in a move that could redraw the domestic U S  banking landscape by reducing costs and unleashing a wave of mergers and acquisitions activity  The agreement also proposes exempting banks with less than  10 billion in assets from the so called Volcker Rule which bans banks from speculating in markets with their own capital   despised by lenders for its heavy compliance costs  Bankers  who have been lobbying hard for congressional regulatory relief under the business friendly administration of Republican President Donald Trump  cheered the deal as a positive signal for the industry    While this legislation could go much further  ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right sizing the rules for America s banks   Rob Nichols  president and CEO of the American Bankers Association said in a statement  The House of Representatives has already passed a broad rewrite of the Dodd Frank law  but Senate agreement is necessary before the Republican led Congress can approve easing rules for banks   Industry expectations on a final deal had been muted because Senate Republicans need eight Democrats to support their efforts in order to pass changes to the post crisis rules  The Senate bill  which is more limited in scope than the House s original proposal  has nine Democratic co sponsors  meaning it is likely to pass into law   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo struck the deal with a group of moderate Democratic senators including Joe Donnelly  Heidi Heitkamp  Jon Tester and Mark Warner  who took over the discussions with Crapo after the committee s ranking Democrat  Sherrod Brown  walked away from the talks last week  In a statement  Crapo said the proposal would  right size  regulation for small banks  but it has been strongly opposed by consumer groups and some powerful Democrats who argue it will increase risks to the system  potentially hurting consumers   I understand my colleagues  interest in agreeing to this legislation  but disagree on the wisdom of rolling back so many of Dodd Frank s protections with almost no gains for working families   Brown said in a statement   The KBW Regional Banking Index of bank stocks turned positive around midday and was up about 1 4 percent after steadily climbing in afternoon trading  RAISING THE THRESHOLD Central to the bipartisan discussions has been the asset threshold at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions or  SIFIs   subjecting them to much stricter oversight including higher capital buffers  That threshold starts at  50 billion  but Monday s bill would raise it to  250 billion  releasing more than a dozen banks from the stricter rules  according to an analysis by the government s Office of Financial Research   Banks with assets between  50 billion and  100 billion would be exempt once the bill is enacted  while those with assets between  100 billion and  250 billion would be exempted 18 months later   The bill would give the Federal Reserve discretion to release banks in the second bracket from the SIFI designation prior to the 18 month deadline if it sees fit  and to reinstate them as SIFIs afterward  subject to certain conditions still being drawn up   Raising the threshold would not only reduce costs for many banks but allow those that have hovered beneath the  50 billion threshold to do deals and expand their balance sheets without fear of being caught by stricter oversight  Although the bill represented a win for many mid sized lenders  the SIFI issue had become highly sensitive in the banking industry  according to lobbyists   This is because banks that fall on the other side of the  250 billion threshold   including State Street Bank and Trust and  Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF    are likely to be put at a disadvantage as their close competitors enjoy a sudden drop in business costs   Nichols said that the ABA would continue to lobby for lawmakers to do away with  arbitrary  asset thresholds altogether and to focus instead on banks  activities when assessing if they should be designated as SIFIs

Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One stock to keep an eye on is Capital One  COF   COF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is COF s P B ratio of 0 74  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 0 89  COF s P B has been as high as 0 97 and as low as 0 66  with a median of 0 89  over the past year 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  COF has a P S ratio of 1 18  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 26 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that Capital One is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  COF sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2019-03-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-capital-one-cof-stock-undervalued-right-now-200402876,200402876
147859,369375,COF,7 Low Price to Sales Stocks To Buy For A Rewarding Portfolio,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying  that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median

147860,369376,COF,Capital One  COF  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Capital One  COF  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 1  
Revenues are expected to be  7 01 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 96  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Capital One 
For Capital One  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Capital One will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Capital One would post earnings of  2 41 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 87  delivering a surprise of  22 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Capital One doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/capital-one-cof-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200408442,200408442

Capital One  which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry  posted revenues of  7 08 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 10   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 91 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Capital One shares have added about 16 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 8  
What s Next for Capital One 
While Capital One has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Capital One was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 96 on  7 08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  11 04 on  28 84 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

147865,369381,COF,Rising credit card delinquencies to add to U S  banks  worries,news,"By Nikhil Subba and Diptendu Lahiri
 Reuters    U S  banks  already under pressure from slower loan growth and low interest rates  could be facing yet another challenge as a rising number of Americans fall behind on their credit card payments 
Several large U S  banks and credit card companies  including  Capital One  Financial Corp  N COF  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM   reported a rise in credit card delinquency rates for August  the second consecutive rise after falling for four months 
While the rates remain significantly below the levels hit during the 2008 2009 financial crisis  rising delinquencies could result in higher loan losses for lenders 
 A noticeable rise in delinquency rates   even from very low levels   is worth paying attention to   said Andrew Haughwout  senior vice president at the New York Federal Reserve 
JPMorgan s credit card delinquencies rose 1 16 percent in August from 1 15 percent in July  while Capital One reported a delinquency rate of 3 97 percent  up from 3 81 percent in July 
Discover Financial Services   N DFS  monthly credit card delinquency rate rose to 2 1 percent in August versus 2 percent in July 
Overall  seasonally adjusted credit card delinquency rates for U S  banks rose to 2 47 percent in the second quarter from 2 20 percent a year earlier  according to New York Fed data 
Delinquency rates surged during the financial crisis as the economy crumpled and thousands of people lost their jobs  In the aftermath of the crisis  lenders tightened their standards to curb losses from non performing loans 
With the United States now approaching full employment  lenders are more willing to take risks and extend loans and cards to people with low credit scores 
 We have seen some loosening of standards on card originations  low credit score individuals getting credit cards or extended limits  which allow them to borrow more   Haughwout said 
U S  household debt levels are hovering near record highs  after having surpassed their pre crisis peak earlier this year  as Americans continue to extend their credit card as well as mortgage and auto debt repayments 
There has been a notable increase in the transition to serious delinquency levels primarily among borrowers with credit scores of below 660  the NY Fed said in a blogpost 
 It is not clear yet what effect it will have on the future  But historically it has been the case that once these delinquency rates start to rise  they can continue to rise   Haughwout said 
Along with lenders willing to take on more risks  stagnant wage growth is also to blame for higher credit card delinquencies 
 Stagnant wage growth is definitely not helping things  delinquencies   When you combine that with rising debt and the slowly rising interest rates  that s a troubling combination   said Matt Schulz  a senior analyst at CreditCards com 
Schulz said the danger is that if the U S  economy takes a turn for the worse  delinquencies could be an affliction because people are bearing bad credit card debt in good times which will be tough to pay in hard times ",2017-09-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rising-credit-card-delinquencies-to-add-to-us-banks-worries-529497,529497

147900,369416,COF,Are Investors Undervaluing Capital One  COF  Right Now ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Capital One  COF   COF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A 
We should also highlight that COF has a P B ratio of 0 70  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  COF s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 0 78  COF s P B has been as high as 1 05 and as low as 0 70  with a median of 0 94  over the past year 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  COF has a P S ratio of 1 07  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 16 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Capital One s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that COF is an impressive value stock right now ",2018-12-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-capital-one-cof-right-now-200370669,200370669
147902,369418,COF,7 Low Price to Sales Stocks To Invest In For Solid Returns,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying  that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price

147904,369420,COF,American Express Earnings Momentum Won t Impress Investors  Here s Why,opinion,"Reports Q4 2018 earnings on Thursday  January 17  after the market close
Revenue Expectation   10 56B
EPS   1 8
It s not that hard to pick a winner from among the top credit card issuers in the U S  Unfortunately  the former king of charge cards  American Express  NYSE AXP   isn t leading the race  it s not even among the front runners 

During the past five years  Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA  delivered more than 150  in total returns to investors  AmEx  at 80   didn t even come close  In the past one year  the situation is even more dire  both Visa and Mastercard performed much better than American Express  in an environment when fears of a prolonged downturn and an economic slowdown hurt financial stocks  Among the three  only American Express showed a negative on its 1 year total return   0 93  
What makes AmEx a low return investment when compared to its high flying competitors is the credit issuer s rigid business model which doesn t help it when consumers decide to go on a spending binge  For example  most credit card lenders offer generous benefits to customers as a way of keeping them loyal as they spend  because the outstanding customer debt makes money for the company over the long run via high interest rates  AmEx s high end cards  on the other hand  generally don t carry balances month to month  depriving the company of this lucrative source of income 
According to Credit Suisse  American Express s cost per dollar spent on rewards for its cardholders came to just 0 81  in 2017  compared to 1 1  for Capital One  NYSE COF  and 1 24  for Discover  NYSE DFS   This makes products with incentives such as cash backs and points for a variety of awards offered by competitors much more attractive  despite AmEx s strong brand and the  experiential value  of its cards 
Another disadvantage we see that continues to drive the underperformance of American Express s stock  the company is more exposed to credit risk than its peers  Visa and Mastercard 
AmEx does not only act as the payment highway for funds  it is also the lender to its cardholders  This means that during an economic downturn  when consumers lose jobs and cannot pay their bills  Amex could see its bad loans rising at a much faster rate  Total provisions for credit losses rose 36  in 2017  and the company said it expects similar growth this year 
Another major challenge for AmEx  to grow its portfolio in an environment where competition from larger banks is intensifying since credit card issuers make some of their richer returns from credit card portfolios when interest rates are low but they are able to charge high rates on outstanding debt to customers 
From its most recent quarterly earnings report  released in mid October  it seems AmEx is doing just fine versus this competitive assault from such big bank rivals as JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Citigroup  NYSE C   After raising its full year guidance  American Express now expects annual revenue to increase 9  to 10  and adjusted profit to reach  7 30 to  7 40 a share in 2018 
For today s Q4 earnings report  scheduled after the market close  analysts expect  1 8 a share profit  up from  1 58 a share a year ago  Sales are expected to grow 20  to  10 56 billion 
Bottom Line
We don t think these double digit top and bottom line gains make AmEx shares an attractive alternative to Visa and Mastercard  our two favorite credit card stocks for long term investors  In our view  American Express s stock  which closed yesterday at  99 41  will continue to lag  especially when the competitive pressures in the U S  consumer market are intensifying 
In order to impress investors  AmEx will need to spend more on technologies and acquisitions  something that may already have begun to happen  On Tuesday  the company announced it had acquired Pocket Concierge  a high end restaurant reservation platform in Japan  This move will give its cardholders enhanced access to top tier eateries there  As well  in December one of the company s executives revealed that AmEx had successfully conducted pilot tests with cryptocurrency XRP to facilitate real time  cross border corporate payments 
In our view  that appears to be the only solid way to truly unlock American Express s brand value and increase shareholder returns ",2019-01-17,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-express-earnings-momentum-wont-impress-investors-heres-why-200376400,200376400

147926,369442,COF,COF Or FCFS  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Financial   Consumer Loans stocks have likely encountered both Capital One  COF  and First Cash Financial Services  FCFS   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Capital One and First Cash Financial Services are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that COF likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FCFS has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
COF currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 63  while FCFS has a forward P E of 23 47  We also note that COF has a PEG ratio of 0 70  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  FCFS currently has a PEG ratio of 1 17 
Another notable valuation metric for COF is its P B ratio of 0 84  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  FCFS has a P B of 2 74 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to COF s Value grade of A and FCFS s Value grade of C 
COF sticks out from FCFS in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that COF is the better option right now ",2018-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cof-or-fcfs-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200359148,200359148

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Capital One due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Capital One Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates  Expenses RiseCapital One announced third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of  3 12 per share  which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 89  Also  it compared favorably with the year ago quarter s adjusted earnings of  2 42 Results benefited from rise in net interest income and strength in card business  Further  a decline in provision for credit losses and improving loans and deposits were the tailwinds  However  lower non interest income and an increase in operating expenses hurt the results to some extent After taking into consideration the non recurring items  net income available to common shareholders was  1 44 billion or  3 01 per share  up from  1 05 billion or  2 16 per share in the prior year quarter Revenues Stable  Expenses RiseNet revenues were  6 96 billion  relatively stable year over year  The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 85 billion Net interest income grew 2  from the prior year quarter to  5 79 billion  However  net interest margin decreased 7 basis points  bps  to 7 01  Non interest income declined 8  year over year to  1 18 billion  The decrease was due to lower service charges and other customer related fees and net securities losses  partially offset by rise in net interchange fees and other income Non interest expenses of  3 77 billion were up 6  year over year  mainly owing to 33  jump in marketing costs Efficiency ratio was 54 19  compared with 51 07  in the year ago quarter  An increase in efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability Credit Quality  A Mixed BagNet charge off rate decreased 20 bps year over year to 2 41   Also  provision for credit losses declined 31  to  1 27 billion However  the 30 plus day performing delinquency rate increased 35 bps year over year to 3 28   Likewise  allowance as a percentage of reported loans held for investment was 3 02   up 8 bps Strong Loan and Deposit BalancesAs of Sep 30  2018  loans held for investment were  238 76 billion  up 1  from the prior quarter  Also  total deposits  as of the same date  were relatively stable sequentially at  247 20 billion Profitability   Capital Ratios ImproveReturn on average assets was 1 66  at the end of the reported quarter  up from 1 28  in the year ago quarter  Also  return on average common equity was 12 40   up from 9 40  in the prior year quarter As of Sep 30  2018  Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 12 8   up from 12 2  in the prior year quarter end  Further  common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III Standardized Approach was 11 2  as of Sep 30  2018  up from 10 7  as of Sep 30  2017 Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter  Capital One repurchased nearly 5 8 million shares for  570 million  This was part of the company s 2018 capital plan OutlookIn the long term  management remains optimistic about deriving efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains In Consumer Banking business  the company projects further rise in average deposit interest rates  driven by higher market rates and increasing competition for deposits along with changing product mix In Consumer banking segment  the charge off rate in auto finance business will increase gradually and loan growth will moderate Attractive and resilient loans in card  auto and commercial banking businesses along with growth in deposits in consumer banking business are anticipated  Marketing expenses in 2018 are likely to be higher than 2017 with mostly increases expected in the second half of the year Management expects 2018 operating efficiency ratio to be roughly flat year over year For 2018  management expects effective tax rate to be around 22  The company s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio  on a fully phased in basis  will rise around 11  by 2018 end

147940,369456,COF,5 Low Price to Book Stocks To Scoop Up For Solid Returns,opinion,Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing usually use the stock s price to earnings  P E  or price to sales  P S  ratio to pick stocks  While P E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price  P S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company Though price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection  the price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use metric for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects  P B is the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityWhat is Book Value Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  The higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditures  high debt companies  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1 PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment equal to A or B  Our research shows

147941,369457,COF,Should Value Investors Buy Capital One  COF  Stock ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
Capital One  COF  is a stock many investors are watching right now  COF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A 
Another notable valuation metric for COF is its P B ratio of 0 84  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  COF s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 0 88  Within the past 52 weeks  COF s P B has been as high as 1 05 and as low as 0 81  with a median of 0 94 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  COF has a P S ratio of 1 34  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 45 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that Capital One is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  COF sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2018-11-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-capital-one-cof-stock-200353989,200353989

147964,369480,COF,Sell These 3 Stocks As Amazon Sets Its Sights On Banking,opinion,"Executives across the world are asking themselves the same question  is there no end to the ambitions of Jeff Bezos and Amazon com  Nasdaq  NASDAQ AMZN  
A good question since it looks like the company nicknamed the  Death Star   after the moon sized  planet killing weapon from Star Wars  is set to take aim at another industry  Just recently  Amazon seemed to be setting its sights on the freight delivery industry then on the healthcare industry and now it seems to be getting ready to target the financial industry  Although as with healthcare  Amazon is in talks with possible established partners in the sector 
Amazon and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM 
Amazon is in preliminary discussions with the largest U S  bank   JPMorgan  NYSE  JPM    to possibly offer its customers a checking account like product 
JPMorgan and Amazon are already partners  having joined forces earlier this year with Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb  to create a not for profit healthcare company  Meanwhile Chase  JPMorgan s retail banking arm  is the issuer of the Amazon Prime Rewards Signature Card  The talks are not exclusive to JPMorgan though as it is believed Amazon is also in talks with Capital One Financial Corporation  NYSE COF  
If discussions with either finance firm come to fruition  it will not be Amazon s first foray into the financial sector  In a very low key launch in 2011  Amazon began offering loans to the small businesses that operate on its Marketplace platform  Amazon said last June that it had made  3 billion worth of loans to these businesses 
The e commerce giant also offers a pseudo debit card  Amazon Cash  It lets consumers add cash to an Amazon wallet and purchase items online without a credit card  And in 2017  Amazon dipped its toe into the deposit business with Prime Reload  This gives customers a 2  bonus when they use their debit card to move funds from a bank account to their Amazon account for use for transactions on the website  This lowered the fees Amazon paid to credit card networks like Visa Inc  NYSE V  and Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  
Amazon Changes the World  Again
If Amazon moves ahead on this venture with JPMorgan or Capital One  it will likely find gold again  A survey from the consultancy Bain found that 60  of U S  bank customers were willing to try a financial product from a technology company  At the top of the list of those most trusted tech firms   you guessed it   was Amazon  along with PayPal Holdings Inc  NASDAQ PYPL  
In fact  a report from Bain found that Amazon s banking services could grow to 70 million customers within five years  That is the same as the third largest U S  bank  Wells Fargo 
At the very least  it will help Amazon lower the amount of fees it pays to financial firms and give it an even deeper insight into its customers  spending habits and income  And of course  it will extend Amazon s web of services that touch a person s everyday life   from food  Whole Foods  to entertainment to healthcare to trucking and now to now financial services 
From an investment viewpoint  I think that Amazon will change the way Americans pay for things  much as it changed how Americans shop  Here s why 
Its move into financial services will most likely not disrupt the banks  which are likely partners  at least right away  But it could disrupt the decades old credit card payment system   the entire swipe fee system is a  90 billion a year industry  This includes not only the aforementioned payment networks  Visa and Mastercard  but also payments processing companies such as First Data Corp  NYSE FDC  that collect 2  on every credit card transaction and 24 cents on most debit card transactions 
Bain estimates Amazon alone could save  250 million in credit card interchange fees every year if just 15  of Amazon customers switch to an Amazon banking account  That assumes  of course  that Amazon finds a bank willing to partner with it on a checking account type product  Amazon Prime members spent about  117 billion with the retailer in 2017  up 50  from the previous year  according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners 
There is a danger down the road for other financial services firms though  if this Amazon venture is highly successful and the ecommerce giant can turn financial products into parts of its ecosystem  Amazon could move into other financial products such as mortgages  property and casualty insurance  life insurance and even wealth management  After all  the online shopping patterns of its customers already tell Amazon a lot about their lives 
The blueprint for such a move has already been laid out by China s e commerce giant Alibaba  NYSE  NYSE BABA  and its success in finance over the past few years  It has amassed the world s largest money market fund  issued  96 billion of loans in five years  and sent  1 7 trillion in total payments through Alibaba s Alipay service last year  That is roughly five times the global payment volume that flowed through PayPal 
If this happens  the much of the U S  financial industry would have been commoditized and firms like Visa  Mastercard and First Data will see their profits shrivel  And the  Death Star  will have struck again

147968,369484,COF,Wall Street hopes software helps it hire loyal bankers,news,"By Olivia Oran  Reuters    Clinching a job on Wall Street soon may have as much to do with beating an algorithm as nailing the interview   Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C  and UBS Group AG are exploring the use of artificial intelligence software to judge applicants on traits   such as teamwork  curiosity and grit   that help in the workplace but don t always show up on a resume or come through in an interview  Banks are turning to the hiring software at a time when they are under pressure to cut costs and finding it difficult to lure and retain top talent  Bank executives hope that artificial intelligence will help them avoid the expense of problem hires and turnover  industry sources said   Up until this point  technology has only allowed you to find the best resume  but now it s a way of truly understanding the people that are applying   said Mark Newman  chief executive of Salt Lake City  Utah based HireVue  a video interviewing platform that uses artificial intelligence to screen applicants  Several banks are in the early stages of adding artificial intelligence software to complement in person interviews and other traditional hiring processes  The banks hope that the technology can help predict which employees will succeed at a given job by creating patterns around large amounts of data that the tests produce  Seattle based Koru Careers Inc makes one version of the technology  which Citi and other banks are using in pilot programs to sort out applicants  Other banks are experimenting with software created internally  Koru begins by testing a client s employees to identify traits that mark high performance  known as a corporate  fingerprint   Then applicants take the same assessment  and the software identifies which candidates are best suited to that company   It may be that what it takes to succeed at Morgan Stanley is different than what it takes to succeed at Goldman Sachs   said Koru Chief Executive Kristen Hamilton  Koru charges its employer clients an undisclosed flat fee for the fingerprint and a license fee for the testing that rises with the number of applicants who take it  Applicants also can record a short video in which they talk about their defining qualities and career aspirations  Koru screens the videos for clients  looking not only at what applicants say  but also their delivery style  including body language and pace of speaking  BAD HIRES RAISE COSTS While Wall Street is not the first place the technology has been tried  it is not yet widespread  The banks hope it will help them compete for recent college graduates who are attracted to Silicon Valley firms and hedge funds  They also hope it will help them avoid hiring the wrong person  which can be expensive and can lead to costly mistakes and lost business opportunities  said bank executives and staffing consultants   Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF  estimates the cost of a bad hire can be as much as three times that employee s salary  The goal of hiring software is to avoid human pitfalls  such as overlooking potentially strong candidates who may not seem desirable at first glance  said Matt Doucette  director of global talent acquisition at Monster Worldwide Inc    The best salesperson usually isn t the one peacocking  it s the mousy person in the corner who is sharp and asks the right questions   Doucette said   But if that person interviewed at face value  they never would have been hired   Koru says its software decreases the number of bad hires by as much as 60 percent   THE HUMAN ELEMENT Some human resources experts say artificial intelligence tools and algorithms don t always capture the best people for a given job and could actually perpetuate existing biases  For example  if a company hired mostly white men who were the eldest children and left handed  an algorithm likely would predict such employees were the most successful  said Brian Sommer  a human resources industry analyst   There may potentially be huge pockets of people who could be even better individuals for a position that end up being excluded because they aren t part of a bigger data set   he said  Citigroup is testing Koru s software on small batches of employees in its corporate and investment bank  a spokesman said  UBS is running an algorithm on digital resumes to identify candidates with preferred traits and is giving those applications priority for interviews  said a person familiar with the bank s hiring process who was not authorized to speak publicly  It also is using the technology to ensure human reviewers don t overlook strong applicants  Goldman is using software developed internally to mine resumes for attributes that reflect desired qualities  such as teamwork  integrity and judgment  according to people familiar with the matter   It also is exploring personality tests to better understand what traits make the most successful bankers and traders  Applicants take a 20 minute test to measure their thinking style  personal associations and emotional intelligence  Their answers are measured against the broader Goldman employee base  Goldman still is considering whether it will use the data as part of its broader hiring process  the sources said  Anthony Onesto   vice president of human resources at Razorfish who is building a robot to help answer HR related questions within companies   said it was still early days for hiring software  
 We re still early  and ultimately it s computers  technology and humans working together   he said ",2016-06-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/wall-street-hopes-software-helps-it-hire-loyal-bankers-406929,406929

147991,369507,COF,Amazon  AMZN  Gains As Company Eyes Bank Deals  Checking Accounts,opinion,"Shares of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   surged more than 1 2  in late morning trading Monday after new reports linked the company to the financial industry  suggesting that the e commerce behemoth s plans to launch new account services might include a major partnership 
Amazon has been in talks with JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM   and Capital One   NYSE COF   about its proposal to launch a product similar to traditional checking accounts  The Wall Street Journal  Monday  Citing people familiar with the matter  the report indicated that Amazon s target is younger consumers and people without existing bank accounts 
A dive into the financial sector would be another addition to Amazon s growing list of attempts to influence its customers  everyday lives  The move would also help the company avoid some of the fees it currently pays financial firms and learn more about people s income and spending trends 
But in talking to JPMorgan and Capital One  Amazon has shown that it does not intend to entirely disrupt the existing structure of the financial business 
 Why put up all the capital that s required to run a bank and why pick up all the extra expense and headache of running a bank when you can go to a Chase and any number of smaller banks and have them license their bank    Ali Raza  managing principal at the payments consultancy Blue Leviathan  said to  
Amazon already has a few services that might help illustrate its financial vision  For one  the company offers Amazon Cash  a platform that lets users add cash to an Amazon wallet by displaying a barcode in person  This enables customers without a credit card to shop online 
Amazon also recently launched Prime Reload  which rewards users with a 2  bonus is they use their debit card to transfer money from a bank account to an Amazon balance  By handling the transaction themselves  Amazon can avoid paying fees to Visa   NYSE V   and Mastercard   NYSE MA

148028,369544,COF,Another Blow For Cryptos  But The Silver Line In Fine Prints  ,opinion,"Another Blow For Cryptos  But The Silver Line In Fine Prints
Another blow for the crypto traders  a sizeable number of banks have disagreed to allow their customers to use their credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies  This had been triggered over the weekend when the US banks  Bank Of America  Citigroup  NYSE C   JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Capital One Financial Corporation  NYSE COF  and Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  have banned their customers to purchase cryptocurrencies  But  take this declaration with a pinch of salt  could there be something bigger coming  We know that Jp Morgan  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  teamed up to form an independent health care company  Nothing can be factored out  but let s stay on the subject on hand 
Back in January  Visa ended it s relationship with a renowned cryptocurrency currency card provider and thousands of people suffered as a result of that  Although  it was a one off case under which Wave Crest did not comply with the Visa s rules and as a result  the company pulled the plug  Nonetheless  the news created enough bad press and gave traders a view that perhaps cryptocurrencies would not be that easily transferred to fiat or readily spendable 
In the UK  the first announcement came from the Lloyds  LON LLOY  banking group  The ban expands to MBNA  Halifax  Bank of Scotland customers  Cryptoexchanges  such as Coinbase allow users to fund their crypto accounts by using credit cards  However  there was a limit  which can be adjusted  by the exchange which has a daily limit  This limit does not allow users to fund their account more than  500 per day  if you are funding your account in a pound  similar limits for other account holders  
Nonetheless  traders and investors should not only look at the big coins and their market cap but look at the ecosystem and the firm is trying to resolve  For instance  R Block is trying to resolve the issue which the recruitment firms have on day in and day out basis  authenticate the references  Using blockchain technology  the reference is saved on the blockchain and is available on request and referees get rewarded for their effort  Looking into the ecosystem and vertical partnership which the firm has would make more sense 
We know Bank s have been against the concept of the cryptocurrency and only now they are catching up with the concept of the blockchain technology  Remember  Bitcoin brought the Blockchain technology on everyone s radar  Banks have used excuses such as higher volatility and money laundering to play down the concept of cryptocurrency  particularly  Bitcoin  In the UK  some institutions have already made headlines by not approving mortgages for those customers who have made their capital gain by investing in Bitcoin and other Alt coin  For me  the message from the banks was that they are using this as a cover by saying that the source of funds can t be verified when in fact they have no clue how to factor that into their accounts 
Remember that the cryptomania is driven by retail investors and these retail clients do use their credit cards and debit cards to fund their account at various different exchanges  Speculations that a credit gives you more secutiry in terms of fraud protection and hence clients use these more instead of a debit card  which doesn t have much merit  Visa has it s protection and it does not make much difference if you spend that under a credit card label or a debit card  Perhaps  what the banks are trying is limiting their exposure to Bitcoin and letting clients use their funds to gamble  Lloyds banking group s initiative in the UK on Monday could only be a start and other major banks could also be looking to adopt the same path  The ban so far is only limited to eight million credit card customers  But here is a big question  which is   should these banks be allowed to control one s transaction when they already have approved their account ",2018-02-05,Naeem Aslam,https://www.investing.com/analysis/another-blow-for-cryptos-but-the-silver-line-in-fine-prints-200286952,200286952
148036,369552,COF,U S  consumers turn to auto loans at a record rate,news,"By Peter Rudegeair NEW YORK  Reuters    A record number of U S  consumers are taking out loans to buy cars  especially those purchasing used vehicles  according to data released on Wednesday 
In the second quarter  85 percent of new car purchases and 53 8 percent of used car purchases were financed  according to data from Experian Plc  L EXPN   an information provider 
That was up 0 5 percentage points and 0 9 percentage points  respectively from the same period in 2013 
Additionally  the size of auto loan amounts and monthly payments continued to rise  especially for used cars  Since the second quarter of 2013  the average used vehicle loan rose 1 9 percent to  18 258 and the average monthly payment on such vehicles rose 1 1 percent to  355  both all time highs 
 More and more consumers  especially those that are credit challenged  are turning to the used vehicle market as a viable option to purchase their next car   said Melinda Zabritski  senior director of automotive finance for Experian  in a statement 
Banks were the largest lenders to consumers buying used cars  financing 35 6 percent of all such purchases  or 0 8 percentage points less than the second quarter of last year 
In recent years banks have begun to focus more on the used car market as automakers  in house financing arms came to dominate the new car market  Such  captive  finance companies made more than one out of every two new car loans in the second quarter  according to Experian 
Regulators have become more concerned with banks  willingness to lengthen terms on car loans  lend to borrowers with lower credit scores and give out loans that are larger than vehicles are worth 
In addition  the U S  Department of Justice has started investigating subprime auto loans that companies such as General Motors Co s  N GM  auto financing arm and Santander Consumer Holdings USA Inc  N SC  have made and securitized since 2007 
But at least in the second quarter  the share of both new car and used car loans that went to borrowers with subprime credit scores declined  according to Experian 
 Lenders are still showing cautionary signs when lending to the subprime market and keeping their risk at manageable levels   Zabritski said 
Wells Fargo   Co  N WFC  remained the largest U S  auto lender in the second quarter with a market share of 5 75 percent  down from 5 89 percent a year prior 
Capital One Financial Corp  N COF  surged past JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  to become the third largest U S  auto lender after Ally Financial Inc  N ALLY   The McLean  Virginia based bank s share of the used car market rose from 3 77 percent to 4 20 percent

148039,369555,COF,U S  retailers gaining upper hand in partnerships with banks,news,"By David Henry NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  banks are finding that  co branded  credit cards they offer with retailers  airlines  hotels and other consumer companies are increasingly a lousy business  one not likely to get better soon  industry executives said   Stiff competition is resulting in margins that are so low they are barely there  analysts said  On Wednesday  American Express Co said it would stop offering a co branded credit card with Costco when its contract with the retailer ends in March 2016  It cited greater competition   These products are big business for companies such as American Express   nearly a third of the company s purchase volume is on co branded cards  In recent years  banks including Capital One Financial Corp and Wells Fargo   Co have increased their offerings of these cards  and Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase   Co have also sought these deals   Retailers are cashing in  Historically  companies rarely switched from one bank to another  But in the last year several big retailers have done so  including Midwest department store Dillard s Inc  which in April switched from what was then a unit of General Electric Co to Wells Fargo   Co  Privately held BJ s Wholesale Club moved its co branded cards from Barclays to Alliance Data Systems Corp   One bank official said competition for co branded cards is heating up but is not necessarily worrisome   Things haven t gone crazy yet   the official said   The official noted that banks that issue Visa or Mastercard credit cards may have more opportunities to generate revenue than American Express does  allowing them to share more money with Costco  For example  card issuers collect fees whenever a consumer uses plastic to pay for something  Because Visa and Mastercard are accepted at more merchants than American Express  a conventional bank might be able to generate more revenue with a co branded Costco credit card than American Express can   But it is unclear how much more revenue banks can wring from Costco cards than has American Express  That card issuer s customers tend to be wealthier than Visa s or Mastercard s  and their higher spending can generate more fees  an American Express spokeswoman said   Co branded cards offer benefits to retailers and banks alike  Customers who  for example  shop often at a department store will spend more there if their credit card gives them discounts  allowing a retailer to reward loyal consumers  These customers will also spend more outside of the store than they might on a regular card  in an effort to earn more discounts  That higher spending translates into higher revenue for banks for processing transactions   With greater competition among banks for this business  more and more of the fees from consumer spending are going to retailers  analysts said  Retailers are increasingly also sharing profits from loans with banks  said Credit Suisse research analyst Moshe Orenbuch in a note on Friday  which could result in lower profits for issuers  Sharing of profits historically has not been common with co branded cards

148055,369571,COF,Should Value Investors Pick Capital One Financial  COF  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Capital One Financial Corporation   NYSE COF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Capital One Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Capital One Financial s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint  which is 10 5  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Capital One Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Capital One Financial s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Capital One Financial has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Capital One Financial currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes COF a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Capital One Financial is just 1 4  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1 5  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 5  which is considerably better than the industry average of 9 0  Clearly  COF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Capital One Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives COF a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter consensus estimate has not witnessed any earnings momentum in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Capital One Financial Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCapital One Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 23  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this

What Investors Cheer For
The company has recently inked a deal valued at nearly  1 05 billion with Parthenon Capital Partners to acquire payment technology company  Cayan  in an all cash transaction  This strategic move has impressed investors 
The buyout would complement Total System s merchant goals to deliver a premium quality of services and solutions  The transaction would further strengthen its huge scale and distribution capabilities

Also last week  the company extended its long term agreement with Capital One Financial Corp    NYSE COF   to continue providing processing services for the company s North American portfolio of consumer and commercial credit card accounts for multiple years 
Can the Momentum Continue 
We believe the company to retain its revenue momentum in the coming quarters on the back of a strong market position as well as attractive core business that continue to be driven by new deals  renewed agreements  accretive acquisitions and expansion of service offerings  These will further fuel a strong contribution to the company s segments comprising Issuer Solutions  Merchant Services and NetSpend 
The company increased its expectation for total revenues of 2017 to the band of  4 839  4 889 billion  reflecting year over year growth of 16 17  from the past guidance of  4 80  4 89 billion   
The company has a strong track of cash flows  enabling capital deployment for acquisition  debt repayment and dividend payment 
Recently  the company completed its deleveraging commitments and resumed share buyback activity which should support the stock 
Further  Total System stock seems undervalued based on its Price Earnings  P E  ratio  The company is currently trading at a forward 12 month price to earnings ratio of 24 9  which although lies near the upper end of its five year trading range of 15 2 25 2 and compares unfavorably with the industry P E ratio of 27 9

148091,369607,COF,Capital One  COF  Accused Of Charging Illegal Overdraft Fee,opinion,Capital One Financial Corporation   NYSE COF   has been accused of charging illegal overdraft fees from customers  Per a Reuters report  a federal appeals court recently revived the proposed class action lawsuit  which had been filed against the company earlier for its wrongdoing According to the 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan  the rules for charging overdraft fee of Capital One were quite confusing and ambiguous  Thus  a lower court judge had wrongly dismissed a breach of contract claim Ideally  if a bank pays their merchant for purchases made by its customers  who do not have enough money in their accounts  it charges an overdraft fee of nearly  35 There can be times when the transaction settlement does not take place immediately  Settlement happens after a merchant requests payment  The process might take a few days sometimes Thus  the overdraft fee to a large extent depends on how and when the transaction is settled  For example  a customer has only  100 in his account and makes five purchases of  10 each and then makes a purchase of  100  If the transactions are settled in the order they were placed  the customer would have to pay only one overdraft fee  However  if the  100 purchase was settled first  the customer would have to face five overdraft fees Tawanna Roberts  a Capital One customer in the New York City borough of the Bronx  who is among the plaintiff  accused Capital One  saying that the company wrongly imposed overdraft fees when it settled transactions i e  at the time of making the payment to its merchants instead of when it authorized transactions at the cash register Notably  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that the total overdraft and bounced check fees in the United States was about  15 billion in 2016 Capital One said to its customers that they could  elect to pay checks and other items drawn on your deposit account or to permit automatic bill payments and withdrawals against your account for an amount in excess of your available balance  an  Overdraft    However  the appeals court  comprising three judges  thought that it was  equally reasonable  to get an understanding of the term  overdraft  in connection with Capital One s decision of making payments at the time of authorization  or the payment itself at the time of settlement Hence  it returned the case to U S  District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan for further proceedings  The appeals court has upheld Schofield s dismissal of three other claims Capital One did not comment on the decision Shares of Capital One have gained 8 8  so far this year  outperforming 1 3  growth of the  it belongs to Currently  Capital One carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A few better ranked stocks in the finance space are First Bancorp   NASDAQ FBNC    Farmers Capital Bank Corporation   NASDAQ FFKT   and Capstar Financial Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ CSTR   First Bancorp s earnings estimate has been revised 9 7  upward for the current year over the last 60 days  In the past year  the company s share price has been up 50 3   It currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Farmers Capital Bank has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Its earnings estimate for the current year has been revised 5 3  upward over the last 60 days  The stock has risen 14 5  in a year Capstar Financial also has a Zacks Rank of 2  Its earnings estimate has been revised 71 4  upward over the last 60 days  The company s shares have increased nearly 7 1  in a year Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2017-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/capital-one-cof-accused-of-charging-illegal-overdraft-fee-200270600,200270600

148128,369644,COF,Cryptocurrency Investing,opinion,"When Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto  no one expected that this blockchain technology would revolutionize purchases  transactions  businesses and operations on personal data within a few years  Now  over a period of eight years  there are 873 cryptocurrencies having a total market cap of  151 323 010 347 
Since the start of the year  we have seen a whopping 850  increase in the value of the crypto market and analysts say that there are several reasons behind this growth including a steady supply of Initial Coin Offerings  ICOs   increased trade in cryptocurrencies  and a sustained number of investors contributing to the expansion of this trend 
Continuing ICO Activity
The research firm Autonomous revealed in its research that companies were able to raise  1 3 billion through the ICOs during the first half of this year  These stats were also reported by CNBC  Surprisingly  FinTech firms have raised a lot more through ICOs than they could through venture capital investment  According to forexvestor com 

With the appearance of ICOs  Bitcoin s market share dropped from over 90  in 2016 to less than 50  today 

These token sales are also undermining the popularity of other traditional means of raising money as the convenience brought by them appears to be attractive to investors and entrepreneurs 
More Funds Entering The Market
The growing number of hedge funds in the market is another key factor which has hiked the popularity of cryptocurrencies  According to reports by Business Insider  there are over 50 hedge funds in the market which are inclined to focus on these currencies  With more funds completing the legal paperwork and purchasing crypto assets  the market will soon be seeing new highs 
The speed at which companies raise money through ICOs is remarkable and one such example is that of Gnosis which raised  12 million is about 10 minutes in April  Putting it to shame were the  35 million raised in less than 30 seconds by Brave which was a web browser startup initiated by the founder of Mozilla  Acceptance in the Market
Mainstream players like Nasdaq  Capital One Financial  NYSE COF   New York Stock Exchange  Visa  NYSE V  and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  have also invested in this underlying technology establishing its importance and potential for growth  Every day  as much as  6 6 billion changes hands in digital tokens 
The most recent fluctuation in the values of different cryptocurrencies was brought about by the Chinese central bank as it issued a notice of prohibiting ICOs  In 2013  China did the same with Bitcoin to promote its own local currency  yuan  However  the price of Bitcoin still managed to see greater heights as more people saw potential in it 
A Bitcoin analyst Kay Van Peterson predicts 

Bitcoin price can reach  100 000 in ten years from now  He expects that cryptocurrencies  not only Bitcoin  will account for 10  of the daily turnover in the Forex market  which is dominated by fiat currencies  

Today  the trading volume of all the cryptocurrencies on a daily basis is  7 billion and if they get to a 10  share then it will rise to a whopping  500 billion which is nothing less than an impressive figure ",2017-10-09,Faizan Raza,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-analysis-to-invest-in-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-200217532,200217532

Stash also offers ROTH IRA accounts that you can start with as little as  50 
Similar to Acorns  it also charges  1 a month and the 0 25  yearly fee when the account reaches  5 000 
Want to Move Up to the Next Level 
Motif offers investing in portfolios  trading and IPOs so it is more advanced than the other two platforms

148165,369681,COF,GLOBAL MARKETS Dollar  yen gain  US stocks up on Verizon results,news,"  Most equity markets slide on fear of worldwide recession
   Dollar retreats after rising to a two year high vs euro
   Oil prices fall  but off 17 month low

previous LONDON 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 27  Reuters    The dollar and yen gained on
Monday as a slide in world stock markets and fears of a global
recession prompted investors to abandon risky assets  but U S 
stocks bucked the downward trend on Verizon s good results 
 Pessimism about the deteriorating global economic outlook
weighed on investors around the world  driving oil prices to a
17 month low below  62 a barrel at one point and keeping alive
a modest safe haven bid in U S  and euro zone government debt 
 The dollar climbed to its strongest level against the euro
in about 2 1 2 years  while the yen hovered near 13 year peaks
against the dollar  The yen also rose to its highest since May
2002 versus the single euro zone currency despite concern by G7
finance officials about its excessive volatility 
 Both the dollar and yen have been the biggest beneficiaries
of global capital flows as investors unwind carry trades  which
use the low yielding Japanese currency to buy everything from
higher yielding currencies to stocks and commodities 
  This is a continuation of deleveraging and unwinding of
risk that has been happening the past week and this has
benefited the yen and the dollar   said Omer Esiner  senior
market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington 
 The Dow and the S P 500 seesawed heavily  with a tendency
to stay positive on optimism over Verizon Communications Inc s
 higher quarterly profit  The company s strong wireless
sales cheered investors 
 Verizon shares jumped more than 11 percent 
 Large banking stocks also got a boost after at least 10 of
them  including Capital One Financial Corp   State
Street Corp  and SunTrust Banks Inc   joined the
U S  Treasury Department s  250 billion plan to recapitalize
the troubled sector and spur lending 
 The KBW banking index  rose 3 68 percent 
 Before 1 p m   the Dow Jones industrial average  was
up 126 48 points  or 1 51 percent  at 8 505 43  The Standard  
Poor s 500 Index  was up 7 00 points  or 0 80 percent  at
883 77  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 6 76 points 
or 0 44 percent  at 1 558 79 
 European shares fell to a fresh 5 1 2 year closing low 
weighed down by fears of an economic downturn 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed down 1 7 percent at 816 04 points    the lowest close
since May 2003 
 The chemicals sector weighed heavily on the benchmark
index  with BASF  down 10 9 percent  Clariant 
8 4 percent lower and Wacker Chemie  falling 9 7
percent 
 Fear of a global recession remained high in other markets 
too  helping push the yield on two year bunds  to its
lowest in three years 
 The price of U S  government debt  which moves in the
opposite direction of yield  were capped by a slight
improvement of sentiment in short term funding markets  helped
by a Federal Reserve program to buy commercial paper 
The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  fell
7 32 in price to yield 3 70 percent  and the 2 year U S 
Treasury note  fell 5 32 in price to yield 1 57
percent 
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies 
with the U S  Dollar Index  up 0 38 percent at 86 887 
 The euro  fell 0 70 percent at  1 2534  and against
the yen  the dollar  was down 0 82 percent at 93 50 
 U S  light sweet crude oil  fell 14 cents to  64 01 a
barrel 
 Gloom about the world economy has had a greater impact than
a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
on Friday to chop output by 1 5 million barrels per day 
  What OPEC did is constructive  but right now that is
beside the point   said Mike Wittner of Societe Generale 
 Gold pared losses as the dollar retreated from highs
against the euro 
 Spot gold prices  rose  2 90 to  736 20 an ounce 
 Japan s Nikkei index  swung wildly overnight in
Asia  before ending down 6 4 percent at its lowest close since

148166,369682,COF,Moscow property bubble to burst   top Russian banker,news,"By Dmitry Sergeyev
 MOSCOW  Oct 31  Reuters    The  bubble  in Moscow
residential property is about to burst and sky high prices in
the centre of the city are likely to tumble  Russian billionaire
banker Pyotr Aven said on Friday 
 Russian property prices have soared every year since 2000
after record oil prices and domestic demand fuelled the longest
economic boom for a generation  Prices in central Moscow are now
on a par with Wall Street and the City of London 
 The global financial crisis  however  has closed
international debt markets for domestic developers and hammered
confidence in Russian assets  leaving many investors to forecast
Russia s ten year economic boom could be about to stall 
  Forty to fifty percent of residential property in Moscow
has been bought up for resale at a later date  not for living
in   said Aven  who was ranked as Russia s 29th richest man in
May by Forbes  with a fortune of  5 5 billion 
  Prices inside the Garden Ring  Moscow s central ring road 
could fall by several times   said Aven  the 53 year old
president of Alfa Bank  Russia s largest private bank 
 Construction  seen as a key component of Russian economic
growth  is forecast by many banks to slow next year to the
lowest level since 1998  when the economy contracted under the
burden of a debt default and rouble devaluation 
 In Russia  where equity and bond markets are still not fully
developed  Moscow property was seen    until the crisis    as an
ideal investment for some of the oil money that has made
Russia s capital one of the most expensive on earth 
 Moscow was ranked as the world s most expensive city on
earth for expatriates in July  in a survey of living costs in
143 cities 
 
 MOSCOW BUBBLE
 The Moscow property market has attracted large numbers of
investors who have ratcheted up prices to levels far above what
most Russians earn in a lifetime 
 Flats in one newly finished but empty house in central
Moscow were being sold for as much as  50 000 per a square metre
  4650 per square ft  on Friday  according to an estate agent
contacted by Reuters 
  The purchase of residential housing is a psychological
thing   Aven said at a conference in Moscow   Since the times of
Soviet shortages  people have bought flats because they thought
it the best place to invest money  
 Aven  a former foreign trade minister  who made his fortune
with banking and commodity deals in the 1990s  said the
liquidity crisis in Russia could force many investors to unload
their flats onto the market  sending prices tumbling 
 Kremlin economic aide Arkady Dvorkovich said he agreed that
prices were overheated inside the Garden Ring  but that prices
in other Russian regions were not  a view that Aven said he
agreed with 
 Aven is not the only billionaire betting against the Moscow
real estate market  Mikhail Prokhorov  ranked as the country s
fifth richest man with a  22 6 billion fortune  said in June
that the Russian property market risked a hard landing 
 Russian developers did a flurry of stock market listings and
borrowed aggressively in Russia and abroad over recent years 
but now banks are unwilling to lend to developers and expect
property prices to fall sharply 
 Rating agencies have forecast a wave of bankruptcies and
forced asset sales in the real estate sector if companies fail
to refinance their debt 
 Russia has said it will buy unfinished residential property
to help developers and Russia s largest property builder  PIK
Group  has been awarded about  1 billion in bailout contracts by

Well  isn t this familiar  The markets have a down day only to bounce back  The S P 500 posted its largest one day gain in two months while NASDAQ Composite recorded its best day in eight months  The S P 500 has been somewhat fickle this month with three of this year s biggest gains and two of its worst losses having occurred in June 
For the first time in seven years  the Federal Reserve did not object to any of the capital plans of 34 banks it reviewed in the second part of the annual  implemented in the wake of the financial crisis  Only Capital One Financial  NYSE COF  needed to submit a new capital plan by Dec  28 to address  weaknesses in its capital planning process  
Last Thursday  all 34 banks passed the Dodd Frank Act Stress Tests for the third time by topping the Fed s requirements for being able to handle a severe recession  Wednesday s results from the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  or CCAR  marked the first time since the test launched seven years ago that the Fed did not object to any of the banks  capital plans 
The passing grade means banks can use extra capital for stock buybacks  dividends and other purposes beyond a cushion against possible catastrophe  And we are already hearing from big banks  Citigroup  NYSE C  announced plans to repurchase up to  15 6 billion of common stock over the next 12 months and double its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share  bringing total payouts to  18 9 billion 
Fewer buyers signed contracts to buy existing homes in May  likely because they can t find or afford what they want  The pending home sales index from the National Association of Realtors dropped 0 8 percent month to month and is now 1 7 percent lower than May 2016 
The number of home sales that closed this spring was slightly higher than a year ago  but the lack of listings clearly held the market back  The supply of homes for sale at the end of May was down more than 8 percent from a year ago  and homes that were listed sold at the fastest rate on record  The tight supply is pushing home prices higher  considerably faster than income growth 
Low mortgage rates have not been much help in offsetting these big price gains  and in fact may be exacerbating the problem  especially if rates begin to rise as is widely expected  The inventory crisis is worst on the low end of the market  where demand is highest 
The number of starter and trade up homes currently on the market is down 15 6 percent and 13 percent  respectively  compared with a year ago  according to Trulia  The inventory of premium homes has fallen 3 9 percent 
The supply situation has buyer confidence in the housing market dropping  Just over half of renters say they think now is a good time to buy  That is down from 62 percent one year ago  While about 80 percent of current homeowners think now is a good time to buy  they are not listing their homes for sale  This may have more to do with weakening affordability than anything else  They don t want to sell if they can t afford a move up home

United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  will freeze a pension plan for about 70 000 nonunion U S  employees because of escalating costs and volatility in determining future payments  replacing it with a different retirement benefit  UPS s pension plans in the U S  had a  9 85 billion shortfall at the end of last year  meaning they were about 76 percent funded  The shift won t occur until Jan  1  2023  giving affected workers more than five years to prepare 
The US announced today it s rolling out a set of new  largely undisclosed security measures targeting some 2 000 international flights arriving at American airports every day  The new rules will apply to 180 airlines flying out of 280 airports in 105 countries  and could prompt additional screening time for the 325 000 airline passengers arriving in the United States daily

Blue Apron s new pricing guidance gives the company a valuation of up to  2 08 billion  below both the  3 2 billion implied by its previous estimate and the  2 2 billion by its latest private fundraising round two years ago  Blue Apron is the biggest U S  meal kit company and the first set to go public

Illinois is already the worst rated state at BBB   S P s lowest investment grade rating  The state owes at least  800 million in interest and late fees on its unpaid bills  Any further downgrade will make it more expensive the next time the state needs to sell bonds 
Two years ago  Illinois s budget impasse meant that the state s lottery winners had to wait for months to get their winnings  Now  with  15 billion in unpaid bills  Illinois is on the brink of being unable to even sell Powerball tickets  And winning the Powerball was probably their best chance of breaking the budget impasse

148336,369852,COF,A Relevant Liquidity Lesson For Complex Structures,opinion,"In the third quarter 10 Q from Capital One  the bank notes a rather large change in funding  At the start of the year  Capital One  N COF  had drawn  17 72 billion in advances from the Federal Home Loans Banks  which of the twelve isn t stated and it is likely there were funding agreements with several   The FHLB system allows banks to pledge collateral in order to receive these advances as one subsidized method of funding bank assets  primarily residential or commercial mortgage loans  That balance was safely less than the overall standby borrowing capacity for Capital One of  29 5 billion 
By the end of Q3  however  the bank had repaid some  13 billion of the advances  Some of that gap was funded by a net increase of  3 billion in longer term debt  The bulk was transitioned by interest bearing deposits which rose by  7 billion  leaving the rest funded when the bank issued another  4 billion securitized debt obligations  The latter are securitization tranches of various forms likely on the bank s credit card trusts that were consolidated years ago under FAS 166 167  post crisis  
In Table 30 of Capital One s SEC filing  the bank suggests the reasons for the rejiggered accounting as perhaps relating to the current phase in of Basel III s Liquidity Coverage Ratio  LCR   We are not privy to the calculations  but a major part of the numerator is FHLB drawing capacity  Again  at  29 5 billion in what could be secured  after generous haircuts  at FHLB  Capital One had  only   11 8 billion available potential liquidity to start the year  The LCR phased effect was to be 80  effective on January 1  2015  but 90  of the final rule by January 2016  and 100  January 2017   Reducing the outstanding advances allowed the bank increased its liquidity potential  satisfying a larger LCR standard  via untapped FHLB advances of  23 6 billion  the difference remaining being a lower advance ceiling by September 30  
It also required the shift in overall funding mix as noted above  which included a healthy increase in potential interest cost via those interest bearing deposits  which had not impacted the bank s profits by the end of Q3  and a real increase in interest expense due to  other borrowings   The first nine months of 2015 cost the bank  241 million in interest on  other borrowings  compared to  226 million in the same period of 2014   82 million in Q3 2015 alone vs   71 million in Q3 2014  
What was interesting was that the moves by Capital One were opposite the general trend in FHLB activity overall  Total advances made by the consolidated FHLB system actually grew by about  21 billion from the start of 2015 to the end of Q3  from  570 7 billion to  591 5 billion  The FHLB system gets its funding for these advances by issuing its own debt  one form of the agency class  There was a reported  858 billion in FHLB debt outstanding at the end of Q3  up about  10 billion from  848 billion at the start of 2015  The rest of that increase in advances was made up through FHLB s asset side  with Held to Maturity securities declining by  10 billion to  95 billion  bonds in the portfolio that matured and were not rolled into new bond positions  and a reduction in cash and deposit balances with banks of a further  9 billion  Between the increase in debt liabilities and the decreases in the bond portfolio and cash and equivalents  that left more than enough to fund the  21 billion uptick in outstanding advances  Whatever was remaining after all that was placed in the money markets  about  4 1 billion 

That makes the FHLB a significant conduit for risk and maturity transformation in terms of funding asset positions at the banks  The remainder is left available for both money markets as well as FHLB s own portfolio  but those are remainders subject to the primary mission of advances 
In August 2007 alone  as the eurodollar market broke down   the FHLB was hit with a  110 billion increase in bank draws on standing collateral for advances  Instead of taking the Discount Window approach with the Federal Reserve  there was practically no increase in Primary Credit   liquidity shifted mightily to the FHLB  For the whole third quarter of 2007  FHLB advances increased by an enormous  184 billion to  824 billion total  By the end of Q3 2008  FHLB advances had ballooned to  1 011 trillion  To fund that huge liquidity draw  the FHLB floated almost  300 billion new discount notes and  100 billion in bonds 
Further  there were other money market effects to consider  As the advances ballooned throughout 2008  that sucked up enormous resources that FHLB could not provide elsewhere including money markets  Total overall advances actually declined by the end of 2008 in Q4 to  928 billion  while the remaining resources that were offered into federal funds and repo markets dropped by about half  some  40 billion  The reduction in FHLB support to general liquidity through advances or remainder money market activity was due to impairment in even its once invulnerable agency debt  From the 2008 FHLB Annual Report 

The FHLBanks experienced a deterioration in debt pricing as investor capital and dealer focus  including investment by the U S  Treasury  was redirected toward those securities offered under the U S  government s programs that carry an explicit guarantee of the U S  government  Furthermore  international investors reduced their holdings of GSE debt securities in 2008  which adversely affected the FHLBanks  funding costs  liquidity and results of operations  During the second and third quarters of 2008  the FHLBanks  funding costs associated with issuing long term consolidated bonds became more volatile and rose sharply compared to LIBOR and U S  Treasury securities  reflecting dealers  reluctance to underwrite  and investors  current reluctance to buy longer term GSE debt  coupled with strong investor demand for high quality  short term debt instruments  such as U S  Treasury securities and FHLBank consolidated discount notes   emphasis added 

Where does monetary policy enter this equation  The Fed believes it controls money markets but it clearly does not  particularly in times of acute stress  The FHLB played a much larger role in money markets  as a secondary money market itself no less  than the Federal Reserve did  Further  this convoluted structure does not easily lend to monetary policy interjection should it have ever been ordered  The Fed could have  of course  bought outright agency FHLB debt to increase that floatation funding  but that still would have left the FHLB system with which to find its own means of distribution far removed from unrestricted flow 
The point of systemic liquidity is for the general order of securities and loan holdings to remain sustainable  Liquidity is not what you see today but what it might be under far worse conditions where bottlenecks and stress points are not easily determined ahead of time  In other words  what makes a bank hold an MBS position yesterday but want or need to sell it at any price today  In the case of MBS in 2007 and 2008  actual liquidity even in the form of an FHLB advance wasn t nearly enough  even though said advances were as good as cash 
Since this bypass liquidity turned on the perceived viability of the collateral itself  the idea of cash was nowhere near enough to forestall systemic retrenchment  The Fed could have bought FHLB debt which might have allowed more advances to be offered  but none of that would have changed the underlying nature of the problem with MBS collateral itself   it still had to be revalued compared to the overly optimistic  unrealistic  numbers that prevailed before August 2007 
The huge increase in FHLB advances from August 2007 on was due to past standby balances that had been approved but undrawn  But as banks drew upon those facilities in greater numbers and quantities it only further impaired both banks  market standing  the unwanted stigma  and then the standing of the FHLB itself  again  the more liquidity provided by the FHLB under old assumptions  the riskier the FHLB appeared to outside investors  international  who were very much aware of collateral assignments and distributions under stressed volatility math  Thus  the very fact that the FHLB was acting as an emergency liquidity conduit meant that it would at some point be shut down by the  market    as it was 
Nothing the Fed did or could have done  even through the FHLB  would have changed those systemic circumstances 
As noted not long ago  that is one reason why UST fails in repo surged to biblical proportions during the worst of the panic liquidations  The Fed could have expanded its balance sheet as much as it wanted and it likely would not have made much difference because the distribution of liabilities or what is taken as  cash  periodically matters more than the quantity of  money supply  the Fed might create  Currency elasticity takes on an entirely different aura in the wholesale format  It just isn t as simple as commanding a lower federal funds rate or even  printing money  because there are chains of liabilities that produce negative feedbacks even when it seems to be the right course of action 
In this one instance  banks essentially offloaded their collateral risk onto the FHLB which only had the effect of  buying  a little time before that strain was visited there   and then  of course  it only amplified where before individual banks were in trouble but now one of the mighty GSE s was  The problem wasn t cash or a shortage of it  but that you had the collateral and had only bad options for dealing with its revaluation   funding it in increasingly convoluted ways or dumping it on the market to take a huge loss  The latter seems the worst possibility  except that continued holding of the security only meant worse and worse funding conditions anyway 
Cash is only one perception of liability and it isn t even the most  liquid  at times  as difficult as that might be to process  The actual structures and plumbing matters  and that includes changing circumstances of factors like collateral standing  And I haven t even addressed the further and perhaps greater complexity that much of these financial  resources  supporting both private money markets and the  market  for the FHLB took the form of eurodollars offshore  leaving even greater question as to how to untangle the illiquid mess as it dissolved further and further  The Fed never had a prayer of forestalling crisis even if it had actually realized that its  rate cuts  and  stimulus  were nothing to anything  It s a relevant lesson that should have been learned eight years ago  but it barely rated notice 
This is not to say that mortgage markets and banking irregularity are to be repeated  only that liquidity is never what you think it is   especially in reverse  The more complex the system  the less knowable and predictable its weaknesses

148401,369917,COF,Is Amex Slumming It ,opinion,Reputations can take decades to build and only minutes to throw away  I thought of that last week when I read that American Express  AXP  was gutting its travel services  laying off more than 5 000 employees    or roughly 9  of its workforce    most of whom work in travel Remember  Amex is the card for the global elite    executives and high net worth consumers  There s a certain cachet to pulling an Amex card out of your wallet    particularly the Centurion Card  also known as  the Black Card    In the company s own words  Amex targets super affluent high net worth individuals on a continual quest for the best and most exclusive  They own companies and frequently travel  they define success Risky MoveHigh end travel services were part of what gave Amex its prestige  So pulling back on the perks that lends Amex that aura of exclusivity might seem risky  Though as Amex CEO Kenneth Chenault noted in the post earnings conference call  the economics of corporate travel are changing In a time of threadbare budgets and global austerity  full service travel agency may seem a bit frivolous  And cost conscious businesses are finding ways to reduce travel costs  both by traveling less  Skype conference call anyone   and by using lower frill airlines and hotels  I have no hard data on this  and I don t know if it s even tracked  But I ve observed on recent flights that Business Class has been noticeably devoid of suit wearing gentlemen in their 40s and 50s    what we might think of as  the business crowd   There are a lot more grey flannel suits in Coach Class these days  Again  no hard data here  just an observation Opposites AttractSo Amex s decision to scale back its travel services may simply be an acknowledgement of changing times  But Amex has made some other moves recently that would seem to be chipping away at its high end image  For example  the company partnered with Wal Mart  WMT     yes  Wal Mart  in launching a reloadable pre paid card targeted at lower income consumers who often have no access to the traditional banking system Now  I have nothing against Wal Mart  It s a fantastic company  I own shares for myself and clients  and I myself have saved thousands of dollars over the years buying my sundries there  But I can t escape the thought that Amex is going slumming Amex should tread carefully here  What separates Amex from the Visa  V  and MasterCard  MA  cards used by the lumpenproletariat masses is the image of exclusivity  Amex doesn t sell financial services  you can get those from any bank down the street  No  Amex sells image And Wal Mart prepaid cards might not quite be the best way to sell that image  Just sayin  Not Your Average SpenderAmex can never compete with MasterCard and Visa in the mass market  but it doesn t need to  The company has roughly 8  of the market based on cards in circulation  according to Card Hub  Yet it has 23 8  of market share by purchase volume  barely 3  below MasterCard  There are a lot fewer Amex users  but collectively they spend a lot more than the average credit card user Unlike MasterCard and Visa    which are payment networks  not banks    Amex is an actual financial institution with all of the assorted risks this entails  Not surprisingly  Amex trades at a substantial discount to its payment network rivals    a forward P E of 12 vs  19 and 20 for Visa and MasterCard  respectively  But given the higher credit quality of its borrowers  it trades at a premium to mass market card issuers like Capital One  COF   which trades for just eight times expected earnings Based on the numbers  Amex is probably priced  about right   neither expensive nor cheap  But I am not a buyer at current prices  Amex seems like a company struggling to find its way in a changing market  A marketer of exclusivity has no business offering prepaid cards at Wal Mart Disclosures  Sizemore Capital is long WMT ,2013-01-15,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-amex-slumming-it-150998,150998

148449,369965,COF,Hedge Funds Are Bullish About These Agriculture Plays,opinion,Severe drought and record heat is wreaking havoc on the mid west food harvest  Lower farm yields and dwindling inventories have resulted in a 50  surge in corn prices over the past month with little relief in sight  But record food prices have created a boom for agricultural chemical companies  The sector is up 13  in the last month with traders are betting that higher food prices will boost demand for fertilizers  The rally in the agricultural space has attracted the attention of institutional investors  Here are the top 4 fertilizer plays hedge funds are betting on  Mosaic Co   NYSE MOS  On July 17  Mosaic reported their 4th quarter earnings  The company beat the Street s expectations by reporting an EPS of  1 19  down 18  YoY due to weaker demand for potash and other agricultural products  However  management provided an optimistic industry outlook  stating that farmers will    with regards to producing more grain due to record high agricultural prices  Trading at 10 6x forward earnings  Mosaic is valued at a premium compared to its peers  With an estimated 5 year EPS growth rate of 8   the stock trades at a rich 1 3 PEG ratio  However  Mosaic has the highest dividend yield in the industry at 1 75   In addition  several hedge funds have been building positions in Mosaic  Michael Kaufman at MAK Capital One doubled the size of his position during the 1st quarter bringing his total stake in the company to  77 million  Richard Chilton at Chilton Investment Company also increased his position by 30   bringing his stake in the fertilizer company to  102 million  Billionaires Ken Fisher and Steven Cohen are also among Mosaic shareholders  CF Industries Holdings  NYSE CF  CF Industries has been the top performers in the fertilizer space  The stock is up 200  over the past 5 years and has returned 14  in the last month  The company reported record profits during the 1st quarter  posting an impressive 54  YoY increase in earnings to  5 54 share  CF Industries is the cheapest stock in the fertilizer space  The stock trades at 8 3x forward earnings  below the company s historical 10 12x forward multiple  The stock also has the lowest dividend yield in the industry at 0 81   Several hedge funds initiated positions in CF during the 1st quarter including Anthony Bozza at Lakewood Capital Management and Michael Messner at Seminole Capital  Billionaire Jim Simons  Renaissance Technologies boosted its stake in CF by 62   Simons  hedge fund has the second largest position in CF among the 400 hedge funds we are tracking  Potash Corp Oof Saskatchewan  NYSE POT  Potash Corp posted sluggish 2nd earnings results on April 26th  The company reported a quarterly EPS of  0 56  missing the consensus estimates by  0 08  The company s revenue was also down 20 8  on a YoY basis  Potash Corp  is the most expensive stock in the fertilizer space trading at 12 3x forward earnings  However  analysts believe this premium multiple is justified due to the company s exceptional growth profile  Potash Corp  is projected to grow EPS by 14  next year  giving the stock a 1 35 PEG ratio  Several hedge funds have initiated positions in Potash Corp  during the 1st quarter including Paul Tanico at Castlerock Asset Management and Michael Karsch at Karsch Capital Management  The company is scheduled to release their 2nd quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday  July 26  Analysts expect a strong report with improved guidance on higher commodity and potash prices  Billionaires Richard Chilton  Steve Cohen  and James Dinan are among the top five holders of Potash  Agrium  NYSE AGU  Agrium shares hit a new 52 week high following a strong earnings report on July 18th  Management raised their EPS guidance by 15  citing robust demand for agricultural products  The impressive results sparked a series of upgrades and target price hikes by equity analysts  Agrium is one of the cheaper names in the industry  The stock trades at 9 2x forward earnings  slightly below the company s 11 1x average forward multiple  Hedge funds were actively building positions in Agrium during the 1st quarter including Wayne Cooperman at Cobalt Capital Management and Michael Messner at Seminole Capital  Value investor Joel Greenblatt and billionaire Israel Englander are among the hedge fund managers who initiated brand new positions in this stock  Disclosure  I have no positions in any stocks mentioned  and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours ,2012-07-31,David Brown,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hedge-funds-are-bullish-about-these-agriculture-plays-131396,131396

148452,369968,COF,Turkcell  Never A Dull Moment,opinion,There is never a dull moment when owning Turkish telecom provider Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri  TKC   As I ve highlighted in recent articles  the company is still embroiled in a multi year  intercontinental boardroom struggle that would rival a daytime soap opera for melodrama and intrigue  Two rival shareholder factions are fighting for control  and after bouncing around courtrooms in Turkey and the Caribbean  the case is now being reviewed by Britain s Privy Council  Yes  the Privy Council of the Queen of England for a Turkish mobile phone company  I couldn t make this up if I wanted to  And now  Turkcell is involved in another international scandal that involves Iranian espionage  United Nations vote rigging and Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney  Turkcell is suing South African mobile giant MTN for  4 2 billion over allegations the company won contracts by bribing Iranian officials with promises of weapons and South African support for Iran at the United Nations  see    MTN also allegedly helped the Iranian regime spy on its own citizens  No  this isn t a movie script  It s business as usual in this part of the world  though the dispute has managed to spill over into U S  politics  One of President Obama s chief advisors took  100 000 from MTN to deliver speeches  leading Republicans to allege that the President has an Iranian fifth columnist in his ranks  Meanwhile  Mitt Romney is a shareholder in Turkcell  meaning that he has a vested interest in the outcome of the lawsuit against MTN  In spite of all of this drama  Turkcell s management has done a fine job of running the company  And as investor risk appetites have returned  Turkcell has seen a monster rally in its shares  Since hitting a bottom in late May  Turkcell is up nearly 40   And barring a relapse into crisis by the Eurozone  I believe the stock has much further to run  It is priced at only 11 times expected 2013 earnings  and once the boardroom fiasco is put to rest and at the risk of sounding like a broken record  it soon will be investors will likely enjoy a large cash bonus from past years  unpaid dividends and a regular dividend in the ballpark of 3 4   I chose Turkcell as my entry in InvestorPlace s  10 stocks for 2012  contest because I considered it a conservative way to play the emergence of Turkey and its up and coming middle class  Thus far  the pick has performed even better than expected  up 26  year to date  With one quarter remaining  Turkcell is in second place  trailing only Capital One  COF  ,2012-09-12,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/turkcell:-never-a-dull-moment-136063,136063
148456,369972,COF,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington and Wall Street,opinion,The European Union was to meet this weekend to come up with a solution to the euro debt crisis that would then be submitted for final approval to the G20 summit on Nov  3 4  but the politics between Germany and France  in particular  are such that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy realized they couldn t agree on anything by Sunday s summit conclusion  so they said a second summit would be held by next Wednesday evening at the latest But to give you as good a sense as any as to how rapidly the situation in Europe is imploding in terms of the economy  one need look no further than new forecasts from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  which took a look at its July outlook for growth for Central and Eastern Europe in 2012 and took it down from 3 7  to 1 6    in just three months  This is staggering  and the numbers are far less than the IMF s forecast in September  to give you another example of how quickly the region is deteriorating Slovakia  for example  was pegged for 4 1  growth by the EBRD in 2012 and now the bank is calling for 1 1   Romania was expected to grow by 3 8  and is now estimated to also have just 1 1  growth next year These aren t the PIIGS  These were the countries that had already gone through their wrenching changes to join the EU in the first place  but without a Western Europe solution  you have a vivid projection of the spillover into the rest of the area  let alone the U S  and Asia  Turkey is another  with the EBRD slashing its forecast for GDP in 2012 from 4  to 2  But it all starts with Greece  You saw the awful pictures  the riots  leading up to another austerity vote in the parliament  Prime Minister Papandreou begged his people to accept a further round of tax increases and fresh cuts to pensions and wages  along with plans to dismiss 30 000 state workers  or Greece wouldn t receive a needed 8 billion euro slug from the Troika  IMF  European Central Bank  and European Commission  as part of the first Greek bailout  Without the 8 billion  Greece won t have funds to pay state workers   Actually  they were supposed to have gone broke by Oct  15  remember  The thing is  Greece is still headed to inevitable default but Germany  France and the others keep delaying the day of reckoning which only makes matters worse  It was once thought Greece needed about 110 billion euro in bailout funds  through 2020  to give it time to finally get its house in order  Yet the economy is imploding so quickly  its needs are now thought to be as high as  get this  440 billion by one estimate  That figure  of course  matches the initial European Financial Stability Fund  which I ve been writing all year was initially thought to be enough to backstop Greece  Ireland and Portugal  I ve also written about a needed second fund of 500 billion euro and sure enough that was the talk by week s end  the European Stability Mechanism  which would replace the EFSF in mid 2013   The original theory behind the second fund was to be big enough to backstop Italy and Spain  if necessary  with both funds also being a source of capital for the big banks as needed  The EFSF wasn t technically to start until mid 2012  but now there is talk of combining the two as rapidly as possible  though it s my understanding the 17 parliaments haven t approved the ESM  certainly Germany s parliament is required to approve it  and so you d have that mess all over again I don t even know what to write anymore  frankly  I want to get everything down  as it happens each week to lay out the history and give a little opinion  but as I started this section  for the first time during the past 18 months  I really don t have a clue what the heck is happening  I mean consider one factor about the 440 billion EFSF  Recall that after Slovakia s parliament became the last to vote to approve the fund  Slovakia was guaranteeing 4 billion of it  the guarantees being proportional to the size of each of the 17 eurozone nations  economies  Well what about Spain and Italy  200 billion or so is coming from them  meaning troubled countries are lending to each other  It s why some of us said way back this whole crisis and the supposed solution was nothing more than history s greatest Ponzi scheme So whatever euro leaders come up with the next few days  assuming they do come up with something because the alternative is a global Crash highlighted by old fashioned runs on the bank that will make Athens  demonstrations look like a church carnival  any solution must be big enough to  at a minimum  guarantee the bonds of the likes of Italy and Spain  let alone the other PIIGS And it has to offer a solution on recapitalizing the banks  which has become the stickiest issue  The EU said only 90 billion was needed to shore up the continent s big institutions  while others say it is closer to 200 billion  and Goldman Sachs says 300 billion These sums never stop amazing  Where is it going to come from  The banks don t want to have to raise more capital because it reduces their profits and leaves them open to government control  Small business doesn t want the banks to have to raise more capital because then there will be nothing left to lend to them and thus you have further stagnation  credit availability already being near nil   France doesn t want to have to use any of its government funds to shore up its banks because then it is guaranteed to lose its Aaa rating  as Moody s warned Monday would be the case  The deterioration in debt metrics and the potential for further contingent liabilities to emerge are exerting pressure on the stable outlook of the government s Aaa debt rating   Moody s said in a statement  If France  or Germany  lose their triple A status  then the EFSF can t raise rescue money  it is supposed to through the sale of bonds  at low interest rates  meaning a French downgrade could lead to a collapse of the entire rescue system   Spain  by the way  suffered another wave of credit downgrades from the three leading agencies  including S P and Fitch  Spain s GDP forecast for 2012 has been slashed to 1  from 1 8  by Moody s  And I haven t even mentioned the  haircuts  Greek debt holders are going to have to take as part of its restructuring  Originally slated at 21  in July  now the talk is 50  to 60   which kills the banks  capital ratios further  they being the prime holders of the scrip Want more bad news  Greece s privatization program was supposed to bring in 66 billion euro that was to be used to pay down debt  Now the estimate is it will raise no more than 46 billion  I d be surprised if they raise 30 billion But wait there s more  We never talk about little piggy Portugal  but Richard Barley of the Wall Street Journal had a piece this week on the country that is the leader in cork and the economy here is now expected to shrink 5  in 2011 2012  with 2012 seeing a contraction of 2 8   The government is at least being as transparent as possible  but consider this  In August  70  of Portugal s exports went to the EU and 24  to Spain  which has no growth  Citigroup says Portugal will contract 5 7  next year As for non euro Britain  Bank of England Gov  Sir Mervyn King warned that as the austerity program hits in earnest  wages in 2011 would be less than in 2005  a further dampening of his January expectation they d be flat over this time period   the worst period for living standards in the U K  since the 1920s  In Britain  the main culprit these days is utility increases  with gas and electric bills going up 13  and 7   respectively  at a time when wages are falling  The Financial Times has a piece Friday night on how even the Queen is having major problems with the utility increases  After all  the bill for gas and electric is expected to account for 8 2  of her frozen income and she has four palaces and a draughty castle  But before we head across the pond to the U S   a word on China  GDP for the third quarter came in at 9 1  vs  expectations of 9 3   The trend since the fourth quarter of last year is 9 8   9 7   9 5  and 9 1   Troubling to some  but still more than solid In fact the consensus GDP forecast for China next year is 8 6   comfortably ahead of the accepted 8  figure that assures a sufficient level of job creation to keep up with urban migration  So while some continue to call for a hard landing here  I m staying in the soft landing camp Other positive figures this week  industrial production rose 13 8  in September vs  a 13 5  rise in August  and fixed asset investment rose 24 9  for the first nine months of the year  better than expected   But China s key stock market barometer hit its lowest level since March 2009 and the price earnings multiple  trailing  here is 10 8  the lowest in memory   If my own large holding in Fujian traded at a 10 multiple  I wouldn t be writing this column anymore just sayin   While I m on the topic  I exchanged notes with the CFO this week  knowing its quiet time  Like all shareholders I m extremely frustrated  but I pretty much got the answer I was looking for  Two other items of import when trying to read the tea leaves in China and whether there will be a hard or soft landing  China Southern Airlines  the largest domestic carrier  cut its 2012 outlook for passenger demand from up 13  to up 8   Not cause for concern  but something that needs monitoring And a major negative  China has suspended work on some 10 000 kilometers of rail projects due to financing issues  Many of the six million migrant workers employed haven t been paid in months as state banks have tightened lending  This definitely requires attention Washington and Wall StreetStocks finished mixed with the Dow Jones rising a fourth straight week but Nasdaq declining as reported earnings were generally positive  More on this later  Sentiment at week s end bordered on absurd  though  as traders took the news that the EU was extending a deadline to resolve the debt crisis as a positive because it meant they wouldn t have to wait out a potential disappointment Sunday night and deal with a down Monday  ergo  they went into the weekend bullish because they wouldn t have to deal with any negativity until Tuesday or Wednesday  by this logic  as if whatever the EU comes up with is anywhere near being a long term solution in the first place More importantly for the health of the U S   we learned the federal government spent a record  3 6 trillion in fiscal 2011  ending Sept  30   Isn t that special  Congratulations to all of us for electing such fine representatives  from the president on down  and congratulations for allowing the unelected power brokers and lobbyists to have their way with us as well You know  I was listening to CNBC s Jim Cramer spout off on Friday about Kelly King  CEO of BB T  and how great the guy is and how you need to listen to one of his bank s conference calls where Mr  King  who seems to be a decent sort  talks about how great America is blah blah blah I m tired of this inane chest thumping  We are a mess  for the handful of you out there who haven t noticed  and to just say stuff like  America s best days are in front of us  is incredibly stupid Do you want to see the future of our country  Aside from the staggering debt and entitlement obligations we ve given ourselves  just look at our kids the supposed future  95  are walking around like zombies glued to their FREAKIN  SMARTPHONES THAT WILL DO NOTHING BUT MAKE THEM DUMBER   So don t give me this America is great garbage  I only want to deal with the facts  I only want to listen to Republicans like Congressman Paul Ryan or Senator Tom Coburn  They may not be the life of the party if you re entertaining  but in case you haven t noticed  the party is over The country is so dysfunctional that we ve stupidly given a protest movement  Occupy Wall Street  a platform when it s increasingly looking like no more than a bunch of Greek anarchists and communists I gave myself the  wait 24 hours  notice when it came to discussing the kinds of kids that are occupying lower Manhattan and while I admit I haven t been there personally  and won t have a chance to get there for a few weeks  I ve seen all the local New York area broadcasts and read the accounts and it s absurd  as pointed out further below  that these lowlifes  who comprise 90  of the crowd  are even granted a forum  Come up with a real protest movement and I ll listen  This isn t one Sorry to get off track  but this week the Senate failed to pass even a stripped down jobs bill   35 billion for teachers  firemen and the like  which highlights the antagonism between Democrats and Republicans  as well as President Obama s failures in leadership as he runs around playing his class warfare game But just a few economic notes  September housing starts came in better than expected but the increase was due to a 51 3  rise in multi family dwellings as opposed to just a 1 7  increase in single family home construction  Existing home sales were still at lousy levels I saw a piece in USA TODAY that addresses the fact local governments have slashed  535 000 positions since September 2008 to close massive budget deficits resulting largely from sharp declines in property tax receipts  That exceeds the 413 000 local government job cuts from 1980 to 1983  the only other substantial downturn in local government employment  according to federal records that go back to 1955    Paul Davidson Wells Fargo revealed as part of its earnings report that delinquencies on mortgages and credit cards rose 4  in the third quarter  the first increase since 2009  which isn t good  Citigroup reported a similar rise in delinquent mortgages  CFO John Gerspach saying the bank was seeing  re defaults  on mortgages that had been modified to make them more affordable  Capital One saw an increase in credit card delinquencies  which means a future increase in defaults on same And remember that congressional supercommittee devoted to debt reduction  You know  the bipartisan group of 12 that has to cut at least  1 2 trillion by Nov  23  thus giving Congress a full month to vote up or down on the proposal or face automatic draconian cuts  half of which come from defense Nothing s happening  The Washington Post reported they have yet to reach consensus on the most basic elements of a plan to restrain spending  Remember  the  1 2 trillion is nothing  Unless the economy takes off like a rocket ship  and in case you haven t noticed  with the end of the space shuttle program  NASA doesn t have a rocket ship and we re relying on the Russians to take us to the International Space Station  the deficit will continue to grow  so we want this supercommittee to think  big   like a minimum of  3 trillion in savings

148457,369973,COF,IPO Look  Regional Management Corporation,opinion,Based in Greenville  South Carolina  Regional Management Corp   RM  scheduled a  76 million IPO with a market capitalization of  216 million at a price range mid point of  18 for Wednesday  March 28  2012  Manager  Joint Managers  Jefferies  Stephens RM is one of nine new IPOs scheduled for the week of March 26  For a summary  SUMMARYRM is in the specialty finance business providing credit to credit challenged individuals in four south eastern states  RM is 75  owned pre IPO by private equity funds  and the IPO proceeds from 2 8 million company shares are allocated to repay debt  except for  1 4 million allocated to pay a management termination fee to RM s private equity sponsors  Shareholders intend to also sell 1 4 million shares RM is priced within range of similar companies  such as World Acceptance  WRLD   a competitor named in the S 1 filing and Capital One  COF  CONCLUSIONRM s IPO is on the small side and may have trouble attracting much institutional investor interest  Plus  there is nothing really compelling about their business outlook  although it is priced at a slight discount to WRLD on a P E basis and is in the same price to book value range Therefore  we think it will probably go up a little on the IPO  but we re not particularly enthusiastic about RM BUSINESSRM is a diversified specialty consumer finance company providing a broad array of loan products primarily to customers with limited access to consumer credit from banks  thrifts  credit card companies and other traditional lenders RM began operations in 1987 with four branches in South Carolina  Update  As of December 31  2011 there are 170 locations with 174 000 active accounts across South Carolina  Texas  North Carolina  Tennessee  Alabama and Oklahoma REGIONALA substantial majority of RM s revenue is generated by branches in South Carolina  Texas and North Carolina FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEYear Ended December 31  2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31  2010 Interest and Fee IncomeInterest and fee income increased  17 1 million  or 23 0   to  91 3 million in 2011 from  74 2 million in 2010  The increase in interest and fee income was due primarily to a 22 2  increase in average finance receivables in 2011 as compared to 2010 and an increase in the average yield on loans from 34 4  to 34 6  Interest RatesRM s costs of funds are affected by changes in interest rates  In particular  the interest rate that it pays on the senior revolving credit facility is a floating rate based on LIBOR Although RM has purchased interest rate caps to protect a notional amount of  150 0 million of the outstanding senior revolving credit facility should the three month LIBOR exceed 6 0   RM s cost of funding will increase if LIBOR increases  The interest rates that RM charges on its loans are not significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates Efficiency RatioOne of the key operating metrics is RM s efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing the sum of general and administrative expenses by total revenue  RM s efficiency ratio has improved from 40 5  in 2007 to 38 6  in 2011 as a result of a focus on operating efficiencies and gains in productivity Following the IPO offering  RM expects to incur new expenses associated with operating as a public company and potentially increased personnel expenses  which will tend to adversely affect its efficiency ratio SEASONALITYRM s loan volume and corresponding finance receivables follow seasonal trends  Demand for loans is typically highest during the fourth quarter  largely due to holiday spending Loan demand has generally been the lowest during the first quarter  largely due to decreases in demand as a result of the timing of income tax refunds During the remainder of the year  loan volume typically grows from customer loan activity  In addition  RM typically generates higher loan volumes in the second half of the year from its live check campaigns  which are timed to coincide with seasonal consumer demand  Consequently  RM experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash needs COMPETITIONThe consumer finance industry is highly fragmented  with numerous competitors  The competition RM faces for each of its loan products is distinct Small and Large Installment LoansThe small and large installment loan industry is highly fragmented in the six states in which RM currently operate  The largest installment loan competitor in most of the markets is World Acceptance Corp   an installment finance lender with approximately 1 120 branches  half of which are located in states that RM serves Additionally  RM competes with Security Finance Corporation for small installment loans as well as for automobile purchase loans  RM believes that Security Finance Corporation has in excess of 1 100 branches nationwide RM also competes with a handful of private competitors with between 100 to 250 branches in certain of the states in which RM operates  RM believes that the majority of competitors are independent operators with generally less than 100 branches RM believes that competition between installment consumer loan companies occurs primarily on the basis of price  breadth of loan product offerings  flexibility of loan terms offered and the quality of customer service

148460,369976,COF,One Of Buffett s Favorite,opinion,In the 1994 investment classic The Warren Buffett Way  author Robert Hagstrom delves into great detail on the stocks that catapulted Buffett s fortune into what it is today  In the chapter describing Berkshire Hathaway s primary holdings  he quotes Buffett as saying  I find that a long term familiarity with a company and its products is often helpful in evaluating it     Familiarity  coupled with a great business that does nothing but grow  are two of Buffett s most important investment philosophies    A holding period that for all effective purposes is  forever   is another of his cornerstones  At StreetAuthority  we refer to such stock holdings as  Forever Stocks   and it s little coincidence that many of the Forever Stocks we recommend happen to be in Buffett s wheelhouse    In Hagstrom s book  he discusses Berkshire holdings such as Coca Cola  NYSE     GEICO  The Washington Post Co   NYSE    and American Express  NYSE     Nearly 20 years after the writing of the book  it s little surprise that Buffett still holds all of these names  He details that Buffett first owned American Express back in the 1960s  when he ran Buffett Limited Partnership the precursor to Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE       Today  Berkshire owns a staggering 13  of American Express  Its original cost basis on the 152 million shares is owns is about  1 3 billion  At the end of 2011  it sported a market value of  7 2 billion  It counts as the largest percentage ownership stake in Berkshire s investment portfolio of publicly traded companies Clearly  Buffett has little intention of selling American Express  Its namesake credit cards continue to hold high brand recognition among wealthier consumers around the globe who spend freely and generally pay off their balance every month  This helps the firm avoid bad debt risk that most other rivals  such as Capital One Financial  NYSE     must deal with    Retailers will do nearly anything to accept the American Express card  which gives them access to a higher end consumer base  This includes paying a higher fee to accept American Express Cards  Amex plastic charges were recently pegged in one study at a 34  premium to the 1 6  fee per transaction that market leader Visa  NYSE    charges retailers    A well respected brand such as Amex can be quite profitable  Last year  American Express logged profits of nearly  5 billion on sales of  30 billion  This is an impressive net profit margin of close to 17  that leads the industry average of less than 16     Returning to the growth equation  sales growth over the past decade has been more pedestrian at less than 4  annually  the credit crisis has a lot to do with this   but profit growth has been solid  at more than 15  annually  Bad debts did rise dramatically during the Great Recession  but snapped back even more dramatically since  Net write offs per average loan are close to 5   but rivals have much higher rates  For example  Citigroup wrote off more than 8  of its loans recently and saw a peak above 11  during the financial crisis  Amex s write off rate remained in the single digits at the worst of the downturn    The latest piece of good news out of American Express came in the form of moves to boost shareholder returns  In late March  it announced an 11  increase in its dividend as well as plans to repurchase 150 million shares  The dividend increase was the first since 2007  just before the credit crisis  It will boost the quarterly payout to  0 20 per share  up from  0 18 per share    The dividend yield will now be 1 4   or right around the industry average  Investors familiar with Buffett know he focuses on overall company growth  rather than solely on dividends  And as the world moves away from cash payments and adopts plastic  Amex s premium brand recognition is likely to attract more high end customers from developing economies  This should lead to further growth in sales  profits and dividends over the long run  Share buybacks help too  as they help boost per share earnings over time    Risks to Consider  Shares of American Express are currently bumping up against their highs over the past year  A quick run up so far this year could mean the stock stops to take a breather  but future growth is what is most important for investors  In fact  Buffett has established several positions in stocks trading at their highs because he expects continued strong growth in the years to come     Action to Take     American Express currently trades at a forward P E ratio of about 13 4  This is still quite reasonable in light of the recent run in the stock  And by reasonable  I mean that the multiple is still about 10  shy of its average valuation over the past five years  It is also well below the market average of 15 5 and the industry average of 14 8  Given American Express  easy to understand business model and stellar track record that has spanned many decades now  it should easily trade at a premium to the market and its key rivals  In other words  despite a strong recent run  it should still warrant consideration as a Forever Stock in many investor portfolios  By Ryan Fuhrmann,2012-04-13,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/one-of-buffett's-favorite-120039,120039
