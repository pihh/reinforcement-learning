140364,361879,HIG,Insurers ache for qualified inspectors after U S  hurricanes,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn and Catherine Ngai  Reuters    Insurers are scrambling to find inspectors in Texas and Florida after fierce hurricanes battered the states one after the other  causing tens of billions of dollars  worth of property damage in less than two weeks  Although insurers maintain some number of inspectors  known as claims adjusters  across the U S  year round  they must redeploy staff from other areas or hire contract workers to fill gaps when catastrophes like Hurricanes Harvey and Irma strike  The speed with which they can do so is critical to residents and business owners awaiting insurance payments   The one two punch of Harvey and Irma is no question challenging to the industry   said Kenneth Tolson  who heads the U S  property and casualty division of Crawford   Co  which provides claims adjusters and staff after disasters  Adjusters investigate claims on behalf of property insurers like Travelers Cos Inc  Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG  Inc  Allstate Corp  NYSE ALL   State Farm and Farmers Insurance  Many other policies are backed by federal or state flood insurance programs  Texas and Florida together have more than 340 000 licensed adjusters  according to state agencies  but it was unclear precisely how many were on the ground  Insurers and industry groups said thousands were headed to affected areas from other parts of the United States  On Sunday afternoon  Hartford was prepared to send adjusters into Irma battered areas  as authorities allow access   spokeswoman Kelly Carter said  Hartford inspectors from Georgia  South Carolina  Alabama  Tennessee and Kentucky were poised to assist  she said  Zurich Insurance Group AG had Florida based claims adjusters riding out the storm locally on Sunday  with plans to begin visiting commercial properties as soon as possible  spokesman David Hilgen said  Once Irma passes  a group of risk engineers at Zurich s Tampa hub plan to fan out across South Florida to assess damage alongside forensic accountants  building consultants and mitigation contractors  he said  Some are using drones to help  Brent Hazen  a Farmers adjuster and drone pilot  spoke to Reuters while inspecting a roof in Missouri City  Texas  The drone buzzed above the house for 11 minutes  a process that would have taken an hour otherwise  Hazen said   It is     safer because it means I don t have to get up on the roof   he said  FACT OF LIFE Insurers have been put to the test before  After Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy in 2005 and 2012  it took months for many property owners to receive payouts  partly because there were too few adjusters with the needed expertise  Novice errors like not pulling off drywall to inspect for hidden damage  or not being familiar with software used for loss estimates  can reduce or delay insurance payments  adding to hardships residents are already facing   It s a fact of life after every disaster that there s a shortage of experienced adjusters   said Amy Bach  executive director of United Policyholders  a consumer advocacy group  The inspector shortage may be worse this time because insurers have not faced hurricanes of this magnitude   certainly not two in a row   in half a century  industry experts said  Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide expects  10 billion in insured losses related to Harvey  and perhaps another  50 billion for Irma  Early estimates are likely to change  and do not include claims covered by the government  Many large insurers use their own adjusters  while smaller and midsize rivals are more likely to hire outside help  For hire inspectors can charge  1 000  2 000 per claim in the aftermath of major disasters  industry sources said  Work on the ground can be punishing  After Hurricane Harvey  Steve Sherin  executive general adjuster for Zurich s North American unit  spent five days in Houston  He left his hotel at 4 30 a m  each day to begin long days surveying damage at commercial properties  Last Thursday  he spent six hours walking through ankle deep water and mud in one building  surrounded by the stench of dead fish decomposing on a parking garage floor and the loud noise of cleaning equipment  His workday lasted about 17 hours   It s tiring beyond belief   Sherin said   but there s a lot of purpose in what we do   LONG PROCESS For property owners  an inspection is often the first step in a longer  paperwork heavy process  Few adjusters can immediately authorize payments  especially if policyholders are insured though state agencies or the National Flood Insurance Program  Richard Campell  whose Houston home was flooded  said his inspector was armed with an iPad and estimating software  The adjuster measured rooms  asked about water levels and photographed mounds of ruined belongings in the yard  he said  Campell  67  must now submit an inventory with price replacement costs  including details like his refrigerator s model and serial number  Still  he is grateful that the inspector reached his home in only five days   It was the luck of the draw   he said  Sean Maxwell  27  also of Houston  had to leave her mother s flooded home in a boat  An adjuster visited last week  and the family is now waiting for documents explaining the payout  
 The funny thing is  when it comes in the mail  I don t know how we re going to get it because we don t live there   Maxwell said ",2017-09-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/insurers-ache-for-qualified-inspectors-after-us-hurricanes-527258,527258
140365,361880,HIG,Business interrupted  hurricane damaged firms dig in for insurance fight,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn NEW YORK  Reuters    Business owners who are trying to get back on track after hurricanes Harvey and Irma now face a different sort of challenge  trying to recoup lost income from their insurers  Exclusions in the fine print of policies  along with waiting periods and disagreements over how to measure a company s lost income  make business interruption claims among the trickiest in an industry renowned for complexity   I think the whole thing is a rip off   said Thomas Arnold  an optometrist in Sugar Land  Texas  He said his business  Today s Vision  was shuttered for almost five days after Hurricane Harvey struck because nearby flooding kept employees and patients from getting there  Arnold says he pays  1 083 per month for coverage  But after he filed a claim  he said the U S  unit of Zurich Insurance Group AG  rejected it because his business was not physically damaged  Zurich does not comment about specific claims  the company said in a statement  It added that business interruption coverage generally requires  direct physical damage  to a property for a payout  It was Arnold s second disappointing experience with business interruption coverage  He said another insurer denied his claim in 2008 after a nine day power outage from Hurricane Ike  Devastating storms are hitting the United States with increasing frequency  Risk modeling firm AIR Worldwide predicts losses to all properties from the flooding in Texas alone will be  65 billion to  75 billion  regardless of whether they are insured   For a graphic on the costliest U S  hurricanes  see   The income lost by shuttered firms makes up a significant chunk of overall losses from a natural disaster and can hobble the pace of a community s economic and social recovery  Hurricane Katrina in 2005  for example  caused about  25 billion in insured commercial losses  of which  6 billion to  9 billion has been attributed to business interruption  according to information posted on AIR s website  The National Flood Insurance Program  NFIP does not offer a business interruption component  The program is largely used by homeowners  but it also covers commercial structures for up to  500 000 in damage  with another  500 000 for the contents   That is why companies able to afford the additional protection of business interruption insurance  usually large and medium sized firms  often purchase it despite the potential for unsuccessful and drawn out claims  Big Star Honda  a car dealership in Houston  lost 600 vehicles   95 percent of its inventory   and was shut for five days after Harvey  Its managers are now girding themselves for a potentially long slog with the firm s insurance company as the dealership prepares to make a claim on its business interruption policy   We re collecting every single invoice that pertains to the hurricane   said Allen Paul  Houston regional vice president of Ken Garff Automotive Group  which owns the dealership   I m really curious to see how that goes   he said  The dealership also has a flood policy through the NFIP  but relatively few firms do  As of June 30  2017  the NFIP had just 264 681 non residential policies  said a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency  the agency that runs the government backed flood insurance program   That figure covers businesses but could also include churches  private schools and community centers  and is a sliver of the estimated 2 4 million small businesses located in flood prone Florida alone  NUMBER CRUNCHING Insurers such as Travelers Companies Inc and Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG  Inc are bracing for a wave of claims from businesses in Texas and Florida  They face a daunting task  The size and scope of the two storms  which pounded the states within two weeks of each other  affected everything from energy refineries to hoteliers   Insurers are craving information now   said Allen Melton  Americas Leader of Insurance Claims Services for Ernst   Young LLP   They want to know how big a claim we are looking at and what the issues are    The answers to those questions are often difficult for businesses and insurance companies to pinpoint  Both sides often hire their own forensic accountants to comb through profit and loss accounts from the current and prior years  It can take months  and sometimes years  for a policyholder to receive monies owed  Insurance brokerage Aon PLC is still working on claims from Hurricane Matthew  which struck South Carolina last October  said Jill Dalton  who leads claims for Aon  Many business owners in the storm ravaged Florida Keys are not even close to estimating their losses because they cannot get to their properties yet   When you have property damage  you can pretty much figure out how much it costs to buy nails and a hammer and wood   said Gary Marchitello  North American Head of Property Broking for Willis Towers Watson PLC   But reasonable minds can differ about how the business would have done if the loss hadn t occurred   Payouts can hinge on factors such as whether a storm hits during a slow season or if a business can make up for lost time in another quarter  Back in Texas  Arnold  the optometrist  is rethinking his coverage   I m going to sit down with my insurer and drastically cut my insurance   he said   If my office burns down or a tornado hits it  I want coverage for that   Arnold said   But if people come in my office and steal my glasses  I ll pay for that

140389,361904,HIG,Is Hartford Financial  HIG  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Hartford Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE HIG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Hartford Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 62  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 64  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Hartford Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 36  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Hartford Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Hartford Financial has a P S ratio of about 1 14  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Hartford Financial currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Hartford Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  What About the Stock Overall Though Hartford Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A  This gives HIG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up and one down in the same time period  This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 3 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Hartford Financial Services Group  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineHartford Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 26  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through Q3 2019  while the S P 500 gained  39 6   five of our strategies returned  51 8    57 5    96 9    119 0   and even  158 9  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   Q3 2019  while the S P averaged

140426,361941,HIG,Why The Hartford  HIG  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider The Hartford  HIG   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This insurance and financial services company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 15 96  
For the most recent quarter  The Hartford was expected to post earnings of  1 11 per share  but it reported  1 33 per share instead  representing a surprise of 19 82   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 24 per share  while it actually produced  1 39 per share  a surprise of 12 10  
Price and EPS Surprise

For The Hartford  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
The Hartford currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 52   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 4  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric

140454,361969,HIG,Why The Hartford  HIG  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
The Hartford in Focus
The Hartford  HIG  is headquartered in Hartford  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 33 41  since the start of the year  The insurance and financial services company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 3 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 02   This compares to the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield of 2 15  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 9  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 20 is up 9 1  from last year  In the past five year period  The Hartford has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12 15   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  The Hartford s current payout ratio is 26   meaning it paid out 26  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  HIG expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 24 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 21 02  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  HIG presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-09-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-hartford-hig-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200463717,200463717

140496,362011,HIG,Should Value Investors Buy The Hartford  HIG  Stock ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is The Hartford  HIG   HIG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A 
Another notable valuation metric for HIG is its P B ratio of 1 44  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks solid versus its industry s average P B of 1 48  Over the past year  HIG s P B has been as high as 1 53 and as low as 1 15  with a median of 1 37 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  HIG has a P S ratio of 1 03  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 05 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in The Hartford s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  HIG looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-the-hartford-hig-stock-200435293,200435293

140500,362015,HIG,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For The Hartford  HIG ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider The Hartford  HIG   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this insurance and financial services company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 16 05   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  The Hartford was expected to post earnings of  1 24 per share  but it reported  1 39 per share instead  representing a surprise of 12 10   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 65 per share  while it actually produced  0 78 per share  a surprise of 20  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for The Hartford lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
The Hartford has an Earnings ESP of  0 63  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 1  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-the-hartford-hig-200442665,200442665

140523,362038,HIG,The Hartford  HIG  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of The Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  54 95 in the previous session  The Hartford Financial Services Group has gained 23 6  since the start of the year compared to the 11 2  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 11 7  return for the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 1  2019  The Hartford reported EPS of  1 39 versus consensus estimate of  1 24 
For the current fiscal year  The Hartford is expected to post earnings of  5 12 per share on  20 22 billion in revenues  This represents a 18 24  change in EPS on a 6 04  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 46 per share on  21 49 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 74  and 6 28   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
The Hartford may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
The Hartford has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 5X versus its peer group s average of 9 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 13  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  The Hartford currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if The Hartford meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though The Hartford shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does The Hartford Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of The Hartford have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Prudential  LON PRU  Public Limited  PUK   American International Group  NYSE AIG   and Kemper  KMPR   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 4  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for The Hartford  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-06-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-hartford-hig-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200429207,200429207
140524,362039,HIG,Is Hartford  HIG  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Hartford Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE HIG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Hartford has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 35  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 79  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Hartford s current PE level is in line with its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 98  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Hartford has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 74  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Hartford stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Hartford has a P S ratio of about 1 04  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 22 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  HIG is near the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Hartford currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Hartford a solid choice for value investors     What About the Stock Overall  Though Hartford might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives HIG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the current year estimate has seen five upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1 7  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has risen by 2 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Hartford Financial Services Group  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Hartford is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 4  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech

140527,362042,HIG,The Hartford  HIG  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of The Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  55 8 in the previous session  The Hartford Financial Services Group has gained 25 3  since the start of the year compared to the 11 6  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 14 3  return for the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 1  2019  The Hartford reported EPS of  1 39 versus consensus estimate of  1 24 
For the current fiscal year  The Hartford is expected to post earnings of  5 08 per share on  20 22 billion in revenues  This represents a 17 32  change in EPS on a 6 04  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 45 per share on  21 49 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 28  and 6 28   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
The Hartford may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
The Hartford has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 6X versus its peer group s average of 9 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 15  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  The Hartford currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if The Hartford meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though The Hartford shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does The Hartford Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of The Hartford have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including American International Group  NYSE AIG   Kemper  KMPR   and Cigna  CI   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 8  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for The Hartford  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-hartford-hig-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200434191,200434191

140530,362045,HIG,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  The Hartford  HIG  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
The Hartford in Focus
Based in Hartford  The Hartford  HIG  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 26 05   Currently paying a dividend of  0 3 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 14   In comparison  the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield is 2 3   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 92  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 20 is up 9 1  from last year  Over the last 5 years  The Hartford has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12 93   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  The Hartford s current payout ratio is 27   meaning it paid out 27  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
HIG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 11 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 18 01  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that HIG is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-06-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-the-hartford-hig-could-be-a-great-choice-200434929,200434929
140557,362072,HIG,3 Reasons Why The Hartford  HIG  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
The Hartford  HIG  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this insurance and financial services company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for The Hartford is 3 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 4  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  The Hartford has an S TA ratio of 0 31  which means that the company gets  0 31 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 2  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And The Hartford looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 0 5  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for The Hartford have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made The Hartford a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that The Hartford is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-05-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-the-hartford-hig-is-a-great-growth-stock-200418056,200418056

The Hartford in Focus
The Hartford  HIG  is headquartered in Hartford  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 21 96  since the start of the year  The insurance and financial services company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 3 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 21   This compares to the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield of 2 42  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97

140565,362080,HIG,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love The Hartford  HIG ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
The Hartford  HIG  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this insurance and financial services company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for The Hartford is 3 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 18 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 11 6  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  The Hartford has an S TA ratio of 0 31  which means that the company gets  0 31 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 2  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And The Hartford looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 6  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for The Hartford have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made The Hartford a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that The Hartford is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-the-hartford-hig-200427745,200427745
140566,362081,HIG,Are Investors Undervaluing The Hartford  HIG  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company to watch right now is The Hartford  HIG   HIG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A 
Investors should also recognize that HIG has a P B ratio of 1 36  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  HIG s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 40  Over the past year  HIG s P B has been as high as 1 53 and as low as 1 15  with a median of 1 37 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  HIG has a P S ratio of 1 01  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 07 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that The Hartford is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  HIG sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2019-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-the-hartford-hig-right-now-200428243,200428243

Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  HIG presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-hartford-hig-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200418004,200418004

140625,362140,HIG,Should Invesco Defensive Equity ETF  DEF  Be On Your Investing Radar ,opinion,"If you re interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market  look no further than the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF  DEF   a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12 15 2006 
The fund is sponsored by Invesco  It has amassed assets over  200 55 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market 
Why Large Cap Growth
Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above  10 billion  They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies 
While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates  and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market  investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations  Further  growth stocks have a higher level of volatility associated with them  They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer term  value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets 
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts  other things remaining the same 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 60   putting it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 1 28  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk  investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund  Luckily  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Healthcare sector  about 18 60  of the portfolio  Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc the  NYSE HIG  accounts for about 1 13  of total assets  followed by International Business Machines Corp  NYSE IBM  and Fiserv Inc  NASDAQ FISV  
The top 10 holdings account for about 10 92  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
DEF seeks to match the performance of the Guggenheim Defensive Equity Index before fees and expenses  The Guggenheim Defensive Equity Index is comprised of approximately 100 stocks selected from the S P 500 Index based on investment and other screening criteria  The companies selected have potentially superior risk return profiles during periods of stock market weakness while still offering the potential for gains during periods of market strength 
The ETF has added about 8 42  so far this year and it s up approximately 1 82  in the last one year  as of 02 05 2019   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  41 71 and  50 42 
The ETF has a beta of 0 78 and standard deviation of 11 07  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 100 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
Invesco Defensive Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3  Hold   which is based on expected asset class return  expense ratio  and momentum  among other factors  Thus  DEF is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box   Large Cap Growth area of the market  Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space 
The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF  IWF  and the Invesco QQQ  QQQ  track a similar index  While iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF has  41 B in assets  Invesco QQQ has  66 39 B  IWF has an expense ratio of 0 20  and QQQ charges 0 20  
Bottom Line
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs  transparency  flexibility  and tax efficiency  these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors

140768,362283,HIG,U S  Insurance Stock Outlook   August 2016,opinion,"The long awaited benefits of a rising rate environment that the insurance industry were highly hopeful of after the Federal Reserve s first rate hike  in Dec 2015  in almost a decade  are unlikely to be felt any time soon  as any further liftoff is probably off the table for the rest of 2016  Though domestic economic factors   including growth  labor market conditions and consumer price inflation   are favorable for the Fed s next rate hike move  it will perhaps wait to see stability on the global front 
If concerns over global economic growth weren t enough  the Brexit storm gave the already dovish Fed more reasons for staying away from the next rate hike 
The insurance industry is one of the very few to thrive in a rising interest rate environment as its investment strategies are liability driven  But a prolonged low rate environment could not stop the industry from drawing investors  attention  as evident from the SPDR S P Insurance ETF s 124  gain in the past five years versus 94  gain of the S P 500  What made this possible 
Many insurers have changed their asset allocation strategies in an effort to minimize the impact of the prolonged low rate environment on their business  Moving beyond their traditional holdings  they are investing in racier asset classes for increased returns 
In fact  this has now reduced their ability to reap the benefits of rising rates  Of course  pricing changes based on rising rates will let them earn more  but their revenue model is now stable enough to counter a low rate environment 
A rising rate environment will surely brace insurers  business sooner or later  But the business dynamics of insurers are not that simple  and the relationship of profit with the interest rate is not direct either In particular  Property   Casualty  P C  insurance  which is not very sensitive to the interest rate environment  holds a significant amount of bonds  which would fall in value with interest rates rising steadily  which is very unlikely  though   This will lead to capital volatility in the industry However  a rising rate environment would keep alleviating the pressure on P C insurers  investment income  and thus their earnings  Moreover  a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive  further supporting carriers to grow Life insurers  however  depend heavily on investment income  so they will benefit more from a rising rate environment  There will be relief from operating pressures resulting from tight credit spreads that the low rate environment has exerted for so long  However  the benefit is expected to be modest as life insurers have significantly reduced their interest sensitive product lines in this low rate era  No matter how the changing interest rate environment impacts insurers  normal catastrophe losses   11 billion insured losses in the in the first half of 2016 versus  8 billion a year ago  and continued influx of capital are expected to keep most lines of P C insurance favorable for buyers  Yet  evolving threats such as cyber attacks and a persistently soft market pose challenges for carriers On the other hand  containment of underwriting expenses and a modest increase in premiums are shoring up the prospects of life insurers  But the prolonged low rate environment has been intensifying their struggle to generate adequate returns to meet their commitment to policyholders 
With glaring dissimilarity in business dynamics  it makes better sense to look at the prospects of these two key segments of the U S  insurance space separately  read our subsequent posts for a detailed insight  Overall Insurance Market at a Glance  While continued economic uncertainty across the globe is not leaving the U S  totally unscathed  domestic economic progress makes the backdrop stronger for the country s insurers  Insurers might not see significant improvement in their rate sensitive business in the near term  but growing demand for coverage with improving labor market conditions and evolving insurable risks  such as cyber threat  endemic disease  etc   should keep them afloat  In fact  increasing demand from economically recuperating American households should eventually place insurers in a favorable pricing cycle  too    Moreover  a strong liquidity profile by virtue of continued capital inflow into the industry  ample capacity  conservative product design and evolving coverage will not only limit any downside but will also keep the growth trend alive  Also  the ongoing reserve development should continue to support insurers  financials Further  recovery in underwriting and a lower combined ratio for P C insurers are expected to continue if the trend of modest catastrophe losses prevails  Then again  lower catastrophe losses indicate lower premium rates Moreover  heightened competition might curb insurers  profitability in the quarters ahead  But the rapid influx of alternative capital will keep prices down and expedite M A activities Will Regulation Hinder Insurers  Growth Prospects    Apparently  a safe and sleepy business nature keeps U S  insurers out of federal regulations  which could have marred business expansion  But the industry is yet to be strongly braced by the advantages of operating under state run regulations  Instead  decentralized regulation and consumer protection make the industry susceptible to insolvency  Now  the changing nature of business    more like banks in terms of liabilities    perhaps calls for federal oversight  Though the necessity for a regulatory revamp has been strongly felt after banks witnessed success  this would deliver another blow to the insurance industry  A provision of the 2010 Dodd Frank Act requires setting minimum capital and leverage standards on insurance companies  but these have yet to be implemented by U S  lawmakers  who are considering distinct business fundamentals different from banks  But the industry  which is increasingly contributing to GDP  has scant chance of being relieved of Federal Reserve control for very long  Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification  insurers are broadly grouped in the Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  and are further sub divided into five industries at the expanded  aka  X   level  P C  Multiline  Accident   Health  Life and Brokers  The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry We rank 265 X industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry We put our X industries into two groups  the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1   To learn more visit   The Zacks Industry Rank is  60 for Life   180 for Accident   Health   218 for P C   224 for both Brokers and Multiline Earnings TrendsAll S P 500 companies in the broader Finance sector  of which the Insurance industry is a medium level  or M level  component  have reported second quarter 2016 results  The earnings beat ratio  percentage of companies coming up with positive surprises  is 66 7   while the revenue beat ratio is 54 4

140801,362316,HIG,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Hartford Financial Services Group  HIG ,opinion,"Hartford Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE HIG   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for HIG broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 8 5  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for HIG stock 
If that wasn t enough  Hartford Financial Services Group isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  6 estimates have been reduced  while one has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for HIG ",2016-08-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert:-hartford-financial-services-group-(hig)-200148001,200148001
