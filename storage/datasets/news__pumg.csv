4804,226319,PUMG,Nike May Start Selling Directly To Amazon  Sports Retail Stocks Decline,opinion,"On Wednesday morning  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann said Nike  Inc    NYSE NKE   is close to selling directly through Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN    citing channel checks  Nike stock rose 1  as shares of Amazon gained 0 30  in morning trading 
This announcement has already negatively affected popular athletic retail chains as this move by Nike raises their competition with Amazon  So far today  Foot Locker  Inc    NYSE FL   and Dicks Sporting Goods  Inc    NYSE DKS   are down 6  each  Shares of Hibbett Sports   NASDAQ HIBB   have also lost 6  and Finish Line  Inc    NASDAQ FINL   lost 4  in late morning trading 
Dick s Sporting Goods fell as much as 8  in early morning trading  hitting an almost one and a half year low  while Hibbett Sports fell as much as 6  to a more than seven year low 
Currently  Nike sells on Amazon subsidiary Zappos  but only sells on Amazon through unlicensed third party resellers  Selling directly through Amazon will allow Nike to limit discounted inventory by third party sellers and push full price products 
Nike s shift to selling directly on Amazon s Marketplace could see a 100 basis points increase  Mann said this could amount to  0 6 1 billion in retail sales globally  The company s stock has been the worst performer among Dow stocks over the last three months 
 Taking this step would give NKE direct economic exposure to a large and fast growing distribution channel  while improving the brand presence and expanding access to Millennial shoppers   Mann said in a client note 
Nike follows the lead of popular athletic wear company Under Armour Inc    NYSE UAA    which already sells directly on its own  customized page on Amazon  Licensed third party sellers also sell the company s products on Amazon Marketplace  This arrangement has allowed Under Armour to release its newest merchandise before Nike 
Mann also said this could affect the selling strategies of other sportswear companies   NKE s move could inspire other wholesale brand  many of which have so far resisted a partnership with Amazon com  to directly engage  
So far  the announcement hasn t had as big of an impact on other sportswear companies  stock  Under Armour and Adidas  DE ADSGN  AG   OTC ADDYY   are both down 1   while Puma SE   OTC PMMAF   was up 0 05  in morning trading

4978,226493,PUMG,Puma sees  female future  helped by Rihanna designs,news,"By Emma Thomasson
HERZOGENAURACH  Germany  Reuters    Strong demand for sneakers designed by singer Rihanna helped Puma  DE PUMG  achieve higher than expected sales growth in the fourth quarter and the German sportswear firm said on Thursday a busy sports calendar should help it in 2016 
Puma  which fell out of favour as a fashion brand for women  has made tapping into the booming female sportswear market a key part of its strategy for getting back into the race with industry leaders  Nike   N NKE  and Adidas  DE ADSGn  
It has appointed Rihanna  famous for hits such as Umbrella  as creative director and the singer launched her first clothing collection for the company last week in New York  a goth inspired range in black and white sported by models wearing black lipstick 
 The future is female     we see more and more women across the world are doing sports   Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told a news conference   We feel we can be the brand that owns the space between the gym and the runway  
Puma also announced a deal for reality television celebrity Kylie Jenner to act as a brand ambassador  despite brother in law Kanye West  who designs for Adidas  having previously said on Twitter  N TWTR  she would not sign up to the rival brand 
Puma said quarterly sales rose a currency adjusted 11 5 percent to 879 million euros   979 million   beating average analyst forecasts for 839 million 
Earnings before interest and taxation  EBIT  rose 2 6 percent to 10 9 million  also ahead of forecasts for 6 5 million  although a net loss of 4 3 million was a slight miss 
Despite a busy sports calendar with the Rio Olympics  European soccer championships and Copa America  Puma gave a relatively cautious outlook for 2016  saying it expected sales growth of a high single digit rate  as well as an unspecified improvement in EBIT and net earnings for 2016 
Adidas earlier this month said it expected currency neutral sales and operating profit to both grow by at least 10 percent in 2016 
CEO Gulden said he had high hopes for Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt at the Olympics and said he would continue to be a major asset for Puma even when he stops running  Bolt has said he will decide whether to retire after the Olympics 
 Usain will stay with the brand he has been with since he is 15 if he runs or if he doesn t run   Gulden said 
Puma shares initially rose after the numbers but were down 1 9 percent by 1001 GMT  compared with a 0 7 percent firmer German small cap index  
Puma said footwear sales grew a currency adjusted 11 percent  driven by strong gains in the running and training categories as well as the launch of the first Rihanna designed shoes  punk inspired  thick soled remakes of classic Puma suede sneakers

5134,226649,PUMG,Puma commemorates  black power  salute in U S  market push,news,"By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    Puma  DE PUMG  is launching a campaign to mark the 50th anniversary of U S  sprinter Tommie Smith s black gloved salute at the 1968 Olympics  shortly after rival  Nike  scored a hit with an ad featuring a modern day activist for racial equality   Nike  N NKE  saw a jump in sales after its advertisement with American footballer Colin Kaepernick  who began kneeling during the U S  national anthem at NFL games in 2016 to protest against police shootings of unarmed black men   a gesture that has drawn the ire of President Donald Trump  Puma s  REFORM campaign will see brand ambassadors such as rapper Meek Mill call for people to post images of themselves online with a raised fist to commemorate Smith s silent salute at the Mexico Olympics on Oct  16  1968  The brand is working with rap mogul Jay Z s Roc Nation on live and social media events to fight racism and sexism  and will match donations to charities such as the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU   up to  100 000 in total  Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said it was a coincidence the anniversary comes soon after the Kaepernick ad  and also shortly after Puma launched its garish orange and black  Clyde Court Disrupt  basketball shoes   marking its return to a sport with close links to the social justice movement    We are not trying to make commercial advertising out of this but we think it is good for the brand because it is part of our values   he told Reuters  Puma has sponsored Smith for more than 50 years  He took a pair of their shoes onto the platform when he did his salute  Puma is launching a collection of shoes called  Power Through Peace  on Oct  16  with the proceeds going to charity  Gulden said Smith was a trailblazer for other athletes like Kaepernick  who could not find a job for the 2017 season and is still without a team  Smith never competed again after 1968  received death threats and struggled to make a living for years   What he did then     was the bravest thing an athlete has ever done when you think about the consequences   Gulden said  Nike sales jumped after the Kaepernick campaign  but its shares fell late last month when that did not feed through to an increase in the company s full year forecast  Both Puma and German rival Adidas  DE ADSGn  have been taking share from Nike in its home market in the last couple of years  helped by the popularity of their retro fashion styles  RETURN TO BASKETBALL CEO since 2013  Gulden has rebuilt Puma s flagging business by putting a big focus on soccer and running  while partnerships with celebrities like singers Rihanna and Selena Gomez have revived its popularity among women  It is now making a drive to widen its appeal in the U S  market by returning to basketball  naming Jay Z as its creative director for the sport and signing sponsorships with four top picks in the National Basketball Association  NBA  draft   We are doing it not only to sell basketball shoes     but to sell more soccer shoes  to sell more training and running shoes in America to that kid who then perceives us a performance brand   Gulden said    Doing basketball is a real commitment to the American market and a necessary one to be a successful global company in the long term   Puma s global marketing head Adam Petrick said basketball had a tradition of supporting social justice  with the NBA backing those who speak out such as Puma athlete Skylar Diggins Smith  who is fighting unequal pay for female players   If we re going to participate in the basketball culture  then we have to participate in all aspects of that   he said  Puma s core consumers aged between 14 and 30 have shown an increased interest in activism since the financial crisis in 2008  and Trump s election in 2016   As a brand we can t be worthy of their business unless we are sensitive to that   Petrick said  Adidas faced brief boycott calls in May after the rapper Kanye West  who makes its Yeezy brand  described slavery as a choice and praised Trump  Apart from that  it has not ventured into race politics in the same way as Nike and Puma  although it has scored with consumers with an environmental conscience  who have snapped up its  Parley  shoes made out of recycled ocean plastic  Matt Powell  a senior adviser with market research firm NPD  said the sports industry was ahead in seeking to align with the values of its consumers  with Puma s rivals like Patagonia and Vans owner VF Corp  N VFC  putting a focus on sustainability  He predicts Puma s  fist raising  campaign will bring only a limited boost to sales but will help the brand longer term   The consumer     wants brands to take visible and vocal stands on social issues   he said   There are many more people who would respond positively than negatively   Puma saw second quarter sales jump almost 19 percent in the United States  after stripping out currency effects  Gulden declined to comment on current trading ahead of third quarter figures on Oct  25   Analysts expect the focus on the United States will help boost profitability  which lags well behind Adidas and Nike  as Puma currently lacks scale and distribution muscle in the world s biggest market for sportswear  
Puma s shares  which dipped in January when former French parent  Kering   PA PRTP  said it would spin off the brand  have since rallied on an upbeat 2018 outlook and are trading up almost a third in the last year ",2018-10-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/puma-commemorates-black-power-salute-in-us-market-push-1640849,1640849

 Reuters    European shares steadied on Wednesday  as strong results from lenders  BNP Paribas  and  Credit Suisse  countered a poor report from British bank Lloyds in a market marking time ahead of a keenly awaited U S  Federal Reserve decision on interest rates

After inching lower in early trade  the pan European STOXX 600  STOXX  was flat on the day by 0813 GMT 
In a month dominated by corporate earnings and expectations of monetary easing by both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to help the economy  the STOXX is now only marginally higher for the month 
 It s just position tweaking more than anything else  Definitely a feeling of some risk on rotation  You ve got a combination of both  month end and the Fed this evening   Mark Taylor  sales trader at Mirabaud Securities 
 Given how much hype there has been around this event  Fed meeting   I would be surprised if people weren t already prepositioned and literally just having to react to the earnings headlines  You ll see volumes drift throughout the day

Lloyds Banking Group  L LLOY   Britain s biggest mortgage lender  dropped 3 9  after posting weaker than expected pretax profits  taking London s FTSE 100  FTSE  down 0 3   in an otherwise quite market 
The Fed s decision is expected after European market hours at 1800 GMT  with Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to hold a press conference soon after 
A quarter point cut by the U S  central bank has been fully priced in by money markets  but investors will be looking at the comments with the decision for signs of how far it could go with further easing this year

Investing com    Has the fashion sector cracked the digital age 
You might be forgiven for thinking so    Next    often seen as a rough proxy for the sector in the U K   certainly looks in rude health after a quarterly update that surpassed its own expectations by a long way 
Full price sales rose by 4  in the second quarter  much better than the small drop it had predicted  That s despite sales at its physical shops dropping 4 2    Salvation came   as it almost always the case these days   in the form of online sales  which leaped 12  
 Next   LON NXT  shares were leading the FTSE higher by mid morning in London  At 4 15 AM ET  they were up 7 8   while the FTSE was down 0 3   Other European markets were largely treading water ahead of the Federal Reserve s interest rate decision and press conference later Wednesday  The benchmark Stoxx 600 was effectively flat after its steep drop on Tuesday 
Next is one of a growing band of retailers who appear to have cracked the transition to multichannel distribution  moving away from traditional bricks and mortar operations  Its bigger fashion rivals    Inditex    MC ITX   the owner of Zara and Massimo Dutti  and H M  ST HMb  have offered variations on the same theme in recent years  H M suffering particularly acutely from inventory management problems and misjudged commitments to new store openings 
At the depths of their respective falls from grace  Next was down 48  from its all time high  Inditex was down 39  and H M was down a whopping 66   But Next is now at its highest in a year and H M is testing an 18 month high  Inditex is up 22  from its December low  
Elsewhere Tuesday  German sportswear company Puma  DE PUMG  went from strength to strength  rising 6 1  to an all time high on the back of lucrative deals with soccer clubs Manchester City and European champions Liverpool  as well as its re entry into the U S  basketball market  The company raised its guidance for full year operating profit and sales after a strong second quarter that contrasted starkly with disappointing reports from   Nike    NYSE NKE  and   Under Armour    NYSE UAA  in recent days 
But if Next  H M and Inditex all owe the revival in their fortunes in some degree to transcending the traditional physical store  this week s earnings reports have shown that there s one sector that can t do that  Shares in   Intu Properties    LON INTUP   which owns malls in the U K  and Spain  fell 22  to their lowest in over 27 years on Tuesday after it reported widening losses in the second quarter  That dragged down rival   Hammerson    LON HMSO   which had reported its own tale of woe on Monday and which is now down 18  over the last week   For those whose business is the high street itself  salvation seems as far away as ever ",2019-07-31,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--next-joins-zara-hm-in-cracking-the-digital-age-1940184,1940184

Markets will look for guidance on the future path of interest rates  Fed funds futures put the chance for another 25 basis point cut to arrive in September at just under 70  with the odds for a third in December hovering just above 50  
The Fed s meeting comes against a backdrop of loosening monetary policy around the world  The Bank of Brazil is also expected to cut interest rates at its meeting later Wednesday 
Ahead of the Fed decision  markets will receive input on the health of the U S  labor market with the monthly ADP private payrolls report at 8 30 AM ET  14 30 GMT   That comes ahead of the official government data set for release on Friday 
A regional reading on manufacturing activity in the Chicago area will also be released at 9 45 AM ET  13 45 GMT  
2  Apple  AMD provide mixed messages on earnings front
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  shares jumped more than 4  after quarterly earnings beat consensus even as iPhone sales dropped to less than half of its revenue for the first time in seven years  Revenue from services  Macs and iPads all rose  and CEO Tim Cook s sales forecast for its fiscal fourth quarter topped expectations 
By contrast  shares in Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  sank more than 5  as the chipmaker provided lower than expected revenue guidance for the third quarter 
General Electric  NYSE GE  will be the most watched earnings release before the open  with markets focused on progress in its turnaround plan  Spotify  NYSE SPOT  will also report ahead of the bell  with Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  set to release after the market close 
3  U S  China trade talks end without clear progress
High level negotiations in Shanghai ended ahead of schedule without any clear progress 
No official explanation was given for U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s early departure  The news came after U S  President Donald Trump released a series of tweets Tuesday lashing out at China for what he called its unwillingness to buy American agricultural products  and repeating accusations of unfair trade practices 
Playing down speculation of a complete failure in the talks  China s Global Times editor in chief Hu Xijin   who is often considered a spokesperson for Beijing policy   said that negotiators had an  efficient and constructive deep exchange  
He tweeted that both sides discussed China increasing purchases of American farm products and the U S  agreed to facilitate conditions towards that end  while both parties planned to  hold future talks  
4  U S  futures rise on earnings ahead of Fed decision
Positive earnings and guidance from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  seemed enough to break a two day losing streak for Wall Street as traders braced for the Fed announcement  While the U S  China trade talks ended with little sign of progress  there was relief that there was also no obvious escalation of tensions 
Dow futures gained 72 points  or 0 3   by 5 42 AM ET  9 42 GMT   S P 500 futures rose 6 points  or 0 2   while Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 31 points  or 0 4  
European stocks were also higher  helped by surprisingly strong earnings from BNP Paribas  OTC BNPQY   Credit Suisse  NYSE CS   Next  OTC NXGPY  and   Puma   SE  OTC PMMAF   Trump s Twitter rant against China had sent European stocks to their largest daily loss in three months on Tuesday  while Asian shares closed sharply lower overnight 
5  Euro zone economic growth halved in Q2
The euro zone produced another sign of the global slowdown as economic growth slowed in the second quarter  dropping to just 0 2  from 0 4  in the previous three months 
Inflation data for the region also cooled  paving the way for the European Central Bank to proceed with an expected easing of its monetary policy in September

5468,226983,PUMG,Take Five  Trade war whiplash and other market themes for the week ahead,news,"LONDON  Reuters    1 TRADE WAR WHIPLASH
It s been a familiar pattern in the Sino U S  trade war since 2018  Combative tweets from Donald Trump  high level talks between the two sides  a stalemate  more tariffs and counter tariffs  and then conciliatory messages 
This time it was Trump s turn for a surprise move  raising the stakes in this real world version of the poker game  China then swiftly said it will have to take counter measures 
Global stock and commodity markets are diving deep into the red with investors skeptical over chances of success for Trump s gamble and scrambling for cover in traditional havens such as top rated government bonds  Swiss francs and Japan s yen  Benchmark bond yields have plummeted  with the entire German government borrowing horizon out to 30 years now in negative territory for the first time 
Chinese seed and food company shares and rare earth firms are rising as they anticipate Beijing won t buy more from the United States  U S  shoe  apparel and consumer goods manufacturers are groaning about potential input price rises as well as hits to demand for their exports and damage to their supply chains 
The question of who s suffering most from a trade war has no straight answers  Many reckon no one wins  The Fed s interest rate cut this week may help ease the manufacturing pain in the United States  but the dollar has surged against the yuan since and will offset that for U S  firms  China has done a lot more targeted fiscal and monetary easing  can more easily source U S  imports from elsewhere and also has the ability to inflict pain on U S  commodity and farm sectors that back a Trump presidency 
Trade data due out from China on Thursday is likely to reinforce a trend of declining exports and imports  the latter also a function of slowing investment and demand at home  Its trade surplus with the U S  has been rising too  Growth may be at its weakest pace in 27 years  but foreign investor inflows into China suggest there is no hand wringing yet

2 BOND BONANZA
Investors can t get enough of U S  Treasuries these days and that s good news for the upcoming auction of  84 billion of new debt  The U S  Treasury Department is looking to sell  38 billion of 3 year notes   27 billion of 10 year notes and  19 billion of 30 year bonds between August 6 and August 8 
Appetite seems insatiable for U S  Treasuries after the U S  Federal Reserve s first interest rate cut in more than a decade and President Trump s move on Thursday to extend tariffs to essentially all Chinese imports  escalating a trade conflict that is now poised to further hit U S  consumers and businesses 
And with Trump and Congress having struck a deal on a two year extension of the debt limit in July  another obstacle is out of the way 
Trump s tariff curve ball to the Fed saw markets immediately price in chances that policy makers may have to cut rates more aggressively  U S  10 year Treasury yields touched 1 832  in the wake of Trump s tariff move  The massive drop in benchmark yields marked their lowest level since Nov  9  2016   the day after Trump s surprise presidential win  Thirty year yields hit 2 368   the lowest since October 2016 
Raising a red flag of recession ahead  the inverted U S  Treasury yield curve between 3 months and 10 years has fallen deeper into negative territory since the latest Trump tariff threat   falling to close to the 12 year lows of minus 26 basis points set earlier this year

The central banks of Norway  New Zealand  Australia  India  Philippines and Thailand all hold interest rate meetings next week and hot on the heels of the first cut in U S  rates in over a decade  action is almost guaranteed 
Some will be looking to follow suit  New Zealand is expected to trim another 25 basis points off its 1 50  main rate and there are outside bets that Australia could even make it three cuts in row having already dropped borrowing costs down to 1  
India is expected to make its fourth cut of the year too as growth continues to slow there and while Thailand is not expected to move the strength of the baht is clearly causing worries again 
Then there is the outlier Norway  The issue there is whether or not it sets up a September rate hike  It has been flirting with the idea for months but it might decide that now might not be the best time to do it  If that s the case it will have to massage its message accordingly

It will be busy in Europe next week with a blitz of data ranging from updated euro zone July services PMIs and HSBC results on Monday  German industrial orders  output on Tuesday and Wednesday and ThyssenKrupp  DE TKAG  and Adidas  DE ADSGn  results on Thursday that should show how European consumer and industrial wallets have been holding up 
It comes after two top German firms offered a snapshot of the euro zone s flagging economy this week  Industrial heavyweight  Siemens   DE SIEGn  joined a chorus warning of weaker demand for automotive parts and other products  highlighting how the region s manufacturing recession is sending shivers through the corporate heartland 
The warnings came as data showed euro zone manufacturing contracted at its steepest rate since late 2012 in July as China s slowdown and escalating global trade tension bite 
In contrast  results from Europe s biggest e commerce fashion retailer  Zalando  DE ZALG   UK retailer  Next   L NXT  and sportswear group Puma  DE PUMG  have not shown any major belt tightening on the high street or online  On Thursday  Zalando hiked its profit outlook after a big jump in visits to its website 
This suggests that consumer spending may help the region avert a corporate recession in the second quarter  It also provides another rare ray of hope that household spending may help prop up the region s economy with little sign that factories will be cranking up the gears any time soon

5 NOT SO STERLING
The plunge in the British pound in recent days delivered investors a dose of what might happen should the market s worst fears about Brexit   a disorderly  disruptive break from the European Union in October   come to pass 
Sterling skidded to a 30 month low against the dollar  below  1 21  and down 2 2  in less than a week  as fund managers  industry executives and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney all lined up to warn about the hit to the economy of a no deal Brexit under new Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
The week should provide some insight into how the economy is holding up amid the political uncertainty  On Monday  the Purchasing Managers  Index for Britain s all important services sector is published for July  with a Reuters poll forecasting a reading of 50 2  barely above the line of 50 that separates growth from contraction 
Friday sees the release of June gross domestic product data  Economists predict 0 1  growth rate month on month and 1 2  on a year earlier  down from 1 5  in May  Industrial output is forecast to have shrunk  as is manufacturing 
Some expect the economy may have shrunk in the second quarter  while the BoE on Thursday slashed its growth forecasts for this year and next 
The pound s fortunes remain at the mercy of Brexit uncertainty  but should the economy s downturn prove worse than feared  expect more losses for the British currency

5488,227003,PUMG,Adidas shares slip on disappointing sales figures,news,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN  Reuters    German sportwear company Adidas  DE ADSGn  reported disappointing second quarter sales on Thursday but expects a recovery in the second half after it stemmed a decline in Europe and saw its long struggling Reebok brand recover 
Adidas shares fell 2 3  by 0725 GMT  The stock had rallied in recent weeks on hopes it might lift its outlook   particularly after German rival Puma  DE PUMG  raised its sales and profit forecasts following a strong second quarter 
 Given the recent rerating in the shares since April and narrowing valuation gap versus peers  the lack of a sales or earnings beat is unusual and brand momentum remains concerning    Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  analysts wrote of Adidas 
Second quarter sales rose a currency adjusted 4  to 5 51 billion euros   6 18 billion   shy of average analyst forecasts for 5 54 billion as the company saw a strong decline in the soccer category a year on from the World Cup 
Adidas had already warned in March that supply chain issues would hit sales growth in the first half  citing particular problems meeting North America demand for mid market clothing 
Adidas has eroded Nike s dominance of the U S  market in recent years  pushing retro styles and teaming up with celebrities such as Kanye West and Beyonce 
 Nike   NYSE NKE  has responded by ramping up spending on marketing  with its sales rising a currency adjusted 10  in the quarter ended May 31  driven by a rise of 22  in Greater China and 9  in Europe  Middle East and Africa 
Adidas quarterly sales were flat in Europe  recovering from a 3  fall in the first quarter after the firm took steps to reduce its reliance on its Originals fashion line and boost sales of sports performance gear  with new product launches 
Group sales rose 14  in China and 6  in North America 
Adidas said it was confident sales would accelerate in the second half  allowing it to confirm a full year outlook for currency neutral sales growth of 5 8  and net income from continuing operations of between 1 88 and 1 95 billion euros 
Quarterly net profit from continuing operations rose 10  to 462 million  helped by another quarter of strong growth for ecommerce  where sales rose 37   Margins are higher for online sales than wholesale 




Reebok sales rose 3   driven by the popularity of retro styles  particularly in North America  where the brand expanded 10   and in emerging markets ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/adidas-shares-slip-on-disappointing-sales-figures-1949036,1949036

5535,227050,PUMG,Asia seeks ways to cope with trade war s hit to China demand,news,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
 Reuters    Asian countries are looking for catalysts beyond China to drive their economies as the Sino U S  trade war forces Chinese demand for their exports to shrink 
Luring foreign companies to their shores  finding ways to boost domestic consumption and scouring for alternate export markets are part of that policy mix as China s neighbors cope with flagging demand from the mainland  hitherto a large market for Asia in the regional supply chain 
Thailand has unveiled a  relocation package  comprising tax incentives and changes in laws to attract foreign firms 
Malaysia set up a panel to fast track investments to woo businesses  and said it approved more than  500 million in proposals this month 
Indonesia s central bank cut its benchmark interest rates for the third time in three months last week  while also announcing measures to prop up domestic spending  India and the Philippines have cut rates multiple times

Exports to China from Asia have slowed this year  prompting the sellers to look for substitute markets  Japan and South Korea saw their exports to China fall in the first half  but their shipments to the United States  United Kingdom and Russia rose during that period 
Malaysia and Thailand s exports to markets such as United States  Singapore and Vietnam grew 
 Efforts to look for unconventional markets have seen an increase in shipments to countries like Chile  Qatar  and Sri Lanka   Bank Indonesia deputy governor Dody Budi Waluyo told Reuters 
 We have diversified our export destinations so we can cover the disappearing shipments to China or to America

A Reuters analysis of eight major economies including South Korea  Indonesia and Taiwan showed the contribution of export revenue from China to the total GDP fell to 8  at the end of 2019 s first half  compared with 9 3  a year earlier

Meanwhile  domestic demand added 0 7 percentage point to Japan s GDP growth of 1 8  in the second quarter  more than offsetting the 0 3 point negative contribution from external demand 
Malaysia s economy saw solid growth of 4 9  in the second quarter  on the back of strong private consumption 
 Economic growth is showing signs of slowing in emerging Asia  partly due to trade tensions  However  domestic private consumption is holding up well   OECD said in a July report 
SUPPLY CHAIN SHIFT
A recent trend of Asian companies shutting factories in China and shifting them home would help lower their dependence on China  economists said 
According to a Nomura note this month   Taiwanese companies such as  Flexium  Interconnect  TW 6269  and  Quanta  Computer  TW 2382   South Korean firm SK Hynix  KS 000660  and Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi Electric  T 6503  and Toshiba Machine  T 6104  are looking to move production back to home from China 
Also  some U S  and European companies are shifting their factories from China to other lower cost countries such as Vietnam  Philippines and Cambodia 
German sportswear group Puma  DE PUMG  has moved some of its production to Vietnam and Bangladesh from China  while U S  retailers like Gap Inc  N GPS   Steve Madden Ltd  O SHOO  and Macy s Inc  N M  are also moving out of China 
India is targeting companies including Apple  O AAPL   Foxconn  TW 2354  and Wilstrong Crop  TW 3231   according to a document seen by Reuters 
 Graphic  FDI into Asia    
Foreign direct investment  FDI  has risen sharply in some of these low cost markets in the region  bolstering their current account balances and helping give more room for their central banks to cut policy rates this year 
FDI into Vietnam climbed to  12 billion in the first eight months of 2019  from  11 25 billion a year earlier  Malaysia and Thailand have also seen an increase in FDI

Tommy Wu  senior economist at Oxford Economics  said production processes that require high skills would move to economies such as South Korea and Taiwan while others would likely go to countries such as India and Vietnam 
     Even before the U S China trade war  a lot of companies had been looking to relocate due to rising production costs in China  But then  the U S  China trade war is a stimulating factor to speed up this whole process  ",2019-09-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/asia-seeks-ways-to-cope-with-trade-wars-hit-to-china-demand-1985483,1985483

5630,227145,PUMG,Puma sees profit hit from U S  tariffs on China,news,By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    German sportswear group Puma  DE PUMG  cautioned on Thursday that it would take a hit from U S  tariffs on China in the fourth quarter but still raised its sales forecast and narrowed its profit target after a strong third quarter in all regions   So far everybody is eating the tariffs in their margins   Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told journalists  adding that he expected rivals to increase U S  prices  but Puma would not hike first as it is not the market leader  Instead  Puma would seek to shift even more production for the U S  market from China to countries like Vietnam and Indonesia  Gulden said   Production in China for the U S  market has already been cut to about 20  from more than 50  five years ago  he said  That has incurred extra costs as some styles are now produced in two places  However  it has not led to reducing production in China because the domestic market there is growing so fast and has absorbed volume previously destined for the United States    The fourth quarter will be the first quarter where the U S  tariffs on China will have an impact  Currently  without price increases  this is putting pressure on EBIT  at least in the short term   Gulden said  Puma said its third quarter sales rose by a currency adjusted 17  to 1 48 billion euros   1 65 billion   beating average analyst forecasts for 1 45 billion  while operating earnings were up 25  to 162 million euros  in line with analyst expectations  Inventories rose 28  to 1 14 billion euros as Puma front loaded products for the United States to beat the tariff rise  Puma s shares  which have risen by almost three quarters in the last year  were down 2 8  at 0842 GMT  the second biggest loser on the German mid cap index   The company s growth has been outpacing rivals like Adidas  DE ADSGn  and  Nike   N NKE   which recently reported that its quarterly revenue and profit beat market expectations as a push to sell sneakers direct to consumers gained pace  boosting margins  Puma said it now expects currency adjusted sales to rise around 15  for the full year  up from a previous forecast for 13   while operating earnings will come in at 420 million euros to 430 million euros  versus a previous 410 430 million range  In the third quarter  Puma s sales rose 28 5  in Asia Pacific and 17 9  in the Americas and recovered in Europe  the Middle East and Africa to 9 7   Growth in the Americas was powered by Puma s return to selling basketball products  while the European market was holding up well despite the lack of a major soccer tournament  Gulden said ,2019-10-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/puma-ups-guidance-despite-us-tariffs-on-china-2002948,2002948
5681,227196,PUMG,German business morale steadies  Ifo sees slight fourth quarter expansion,news,"BERLIN  Reuters    German business morale held steady in October and Europe s largest economy should expand slightly in the fourth quarter after contracting earlier in the year  the Ifo economic institute said on Friday 
Ifo said its business climate index was unchanged from the prior month in October at 94 6  That was just above the consensus forecast for 94 5 
 The German economy is stabilising   Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement 
Europe s economic powerhouse contracted in the second quarter and many economists expect it to have shrunk in the third quarter  That would put it in recession   usually defined as a period of at least two consecutive quarters of contraction 
But Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters   For the fourth quarter  we expect a slight expansion  
Ifo s index on current conditions fell to 97 8 from 98 6 in September  But its expectations index rose to 91 5 from 90 9 
Germany s export reliant economy has been suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U S  President Donald Trump s  America First  trade policies and Britain s planned  but delayed  exit from the European Union 
 The uncertainty stemming from Brexit remains high   Wohlrabe said  but added   The downward trend in industry has stopped for the time being  
German sportswear group Puma  DE PUMG  said on Thursday it would take a hit from U S  tariffs on China in the fourth quarter but still raised its sales forecast 
Chancellor Angela Merkel s coalition government has resisted calls for a stimulus package to counter the slowdown
