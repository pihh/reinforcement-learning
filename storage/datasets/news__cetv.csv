107009,328524,CETV,5 Best Performing Stocks Of April,opinion,"Markets continued to gain over last month  even though their advance was curbed by a number of factors  A rise in geopolitical tensions dragged down stocks over the month  Relations between the U S  and Russia worsened over the attack on Syria 
Additionally  North Korea continued to worry political analysts and market watchers alike with its continual saber rattling  Economic data also took a turn for the worse  following a decline in retail and particularly auto sales  GDP also dipped and only first quarter earnings performance held out the hope for further gains 
April s Performance
For the month  the Nasdaq  S P 500 and Dow advanced 2 3   0 9  and 1 3  respectively  During the month  benchmarks suffered a setback due to weak auto sales data  a dip in manufacturing growth and rise in geopolitical tensions 
Meanwhile  retail sales fell in March for two consecutive months  posting their worst two month stretch in two years due to weak demand in automobile sector  However  strong quarterly earnings reports from companies helped benchmarks finish in green for the month 
Domestic Data Mixed  Retail Sales Fall 
Economic reports released last month were something of a mixed bag  Both the ISM manufacturing and services indexes declined to 57 2 and 55 2  respectively  Consumer confidence declined in April to 120 3 from 124 9 in March 
Notably  retail sales declined in March for two consecutive months  posting their worst two month stretch in two years  The decline is attributable to weak demand in automobile sector  Auto sales fell 1 2  declining for a third straight month  Moreover  gas and service station sales fell 1  because of lower fuel prices 
On the positive side  industrial production increased 0 5  while capacity utilization moved upward to 76 1  Construction spending increased by 0 8  in February  Additionally  durable orders increased by 0 7  while factory orders gained 1  
Q1 GDP Plummets
The U S  economy grew at its slowest pace in the first quarter in three years  owing to the smallest increase in consumer spending since the end of 2009  As per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  real gross domestic product  GDP  increased at an annual rate of 0 7  in the first quarter of 2017  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 2   The last quarter of 2016 recorded a real GDP growth of 2 1  
The slowdown in first quarter GDP growth is primarily attributable to sluggish consumer spending  Consumer spending increased 0 3   marking the smallest increase since the last quarter of 2009  Number of purchases of durable goods  including big ticket items  such as cars and refrigerators dropped  Spending on services also recorded its slowest growth in four years  Government spending at state and local levels also declined 1 7   marking its largest fall in four years 
GDP growth was dragged down by almost a percentage point by low inventory investment  Meanwhile  fixed business investment gained 10 4  and was accountable for bulk of the GDP growth in the first quarter 
Job Additions Fall  Unemployment Slips
The U S  created 98 000 jobs in March  significantly lower than expectations of 176 000 additions  One of the reasons for this weak payroll growth number was weather related effects of the big storm that hit the Northeast last month  On the positive side  unemployment rate declined from 4 7  to 4 5   its lowest level in almost ten years  Payrolls data also showed that average hourly wages increased 0 2  to  26 14 
While the actual unemployment figure was within the range of predictions  the number of jobs created missed economists  expectations by nearly 80 000  Moreover  the number of job additions for January and February were revised down a cumulative 38 000 with 216 000 jobs witnessed in January followed by another 219 000 in February 
Q1 Earnings Depict Momentum
A 15 month decline in earnings was snapped in the third quarter  As companies begin to report earnings for the first quarter  that momentum seems to have been retained  We now have Q1 results from 181 S P 500 members that have reported as of Jan 30 and which together account for 40  of the index s total market capitalization 
Total earnings for these 181 S P 500 members are up  10  from the same period last year on  4 3  higher revenues  with 75 7  beating EPS estimates and 64 1  beating revenue estimates  For the Finance sector  we now have Q1 results from 59 2  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Finance companies are up  9  from the same period last year on  7 3  higher revenues  with 67 4  beating EPS estimates and 65 1  beating revenue estimates 
Growth comparisons remain favorable even when looked at on an ex Finance basis  highlighting the broad based nature of the positive Q1 showing  This broad based positivity comes across from the standout Q1 earnings reports in recent days  which have been from diverse backgrounds such as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   DuPont  NYSE DD   McDonald s and others   Read   
Geopolitical Tensions Rise
The month witnessed a significant increase in geopolitical tensions  which had a detrimental impact on stocks  Initially  investors remained focused on the meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping 
Subsequently  the U S  carried out a cruise missile attack on Shayrat air base near Homs  in a possible attempt to target President Bashar al Assad s regime which was held responsible for the chemical weapons attack in Syria last week  A meeting between U S  and Russian foreign secretaries in Moscow on the Syrian chemical attack only served to raise tensions between the two countries 
Tensions between the U S  and North Korea also continued to rise  Earlier  President Trump had said the U S  is ready to deal with North Korea in case China does not come to help in this regard  Meantime  U S  Navy sent a strike group towards the North Korean Peninsula  while North Korea warned the U S  of a possible nuclear attack in case U S continues to threaten her security over the region 
Trump s Tax Plan Disappoints Investors
On Apr 26  the Trump administration unveiled a single page outline for tax reform plan at a press conference  Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn rolled out the outline of White House s tax reform plan which included reduction of individual and corporate rates and simplification of the tax code  The plan promised to slash the top income tax rate from 39 6  to 35   According to the plan  the number of personal income tax brackets would be reduced from seven to three 
However  investors had expected more details about the proposed tax reform package from Trump administration  Investors remained disappointed with the lack of details  leading to losses for stocks 
French Election Fears Recede 
During the second half of the month  investors remained focused on the Presidential election in France scheduled to be held on April 23rd  The rise in popularity of Melenchon  who is a euro skeptic  had unnerved investors with many expressing concern over a possible  Frexit  
After a close contest  centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far right candidate Marine Le Pen emerged as top contenders for the final round of the presidential election in France scheduled to be held on May 7  Macron s victory in the first round not only contributed to gains for European equities but also lifted investor confidence in the U S 
Fed Hints at Balance Sheet Cuts  Warns on Valuations
In the minutes from its March meeting  the Federal Reserve hinted that it could begin reducing its  4 5 trillion balance sheet later this year  Though no time table was mentioned about the unwinding of the  4 5 trillion in bonds on its balance sheet  speculation arose that the central bank may roll back the principal amount to treasuries 
The Fed also raised concerns that stocks were overvalued  The minutes released by Fed showed that some measures of valuations  like price to earnings ratios had risen above historical norms

Will Stocks Regain Momentum in May 
Stocks are facing challenges on several fronts at this time  Geopolitical tensions have heightened and are making themselves felt by curbing gains for stocks  The defense industry has notched up gains as a result  a trend which is likely to continue in the days to come 
Likewise  relations with North Korea  in particular  are likely to remain strained  However  a downturn in the tone of economic data is likely to have a more significant impact on stocks going ahead  Markets will now look to a stellar first quarter earnings performance to provide a much needed boost next month
