3906,225421,AGYS,Retail Sales  Lululemon Earnings To Drive Markets,opinion,The next week brings a relatively light week on the data front  with few earnings and scarce data economic data marking the calendar  The May retail sales report on Thursday and earnings from key companies including Lululemon Atletica  LULU   Navistar  NAV   and PVH Corp   PVH  highlight the vacant calendar  Key Earnings Markets will focus eyes on retailers Lululemon Atletica and PVH Corp  Lululemon is expected to report earnings on Monday after the bell while its fellow retailer PVH will report Wednesday after the close  Truck maker Navistar will also report earnings Monday  Lululemon Atletica The maker of women s athletic clothes is expected to report earnings Monday after the close  Wall Street is looking for first quarter earnings per share of  0 30 on revenue of  341 00 million  In the same period a year ago  the company reported earnings per share of  0 32 on revenue of  285 7 million Analysts at Morgan Stanley weighed in on the stock Friday ahead of the earnings release next week  Morgan Stanley has an equal weight rating on the stock and does not have a price target for the stock   We think 1Q13 expectations are in line with the event s most likely outcome  The market is looking for raised FY13 guidance and probably gets it  We anticipate the pant recall impact debate ends and old debates re emerge  changing stock dynamics    LULU said on 3 21 its black luon pant recall would cost 2013 EPS  0 25  0 27 and this led to a  13  Street FY13 earnings revision  Since then however  the stock is up 26   We believe the market has assumed a less severe impact and we agree  Our store checks suggested customers substituted luon pants with other products and revealed recalled items back in stores earlier than expected    We model  2 03 FY13 EPS vs  the Street s  1 99  We think LULU has to raise its  1 95  1 99 FY13 EPS guidance to  2 00  2 05 to meet market expectations  This is the most probable scenario in our view and likely causes a muted stock reaction  We don t see much guidance upside since LULU usually forecasts conservatively  If LULU misses 1Q EPS or guidance falls short  the stock likely drops  but the converse is also true  We doubt either happens  although the risk reward seems slightly skewed down  The options market is pricing in a     7  jump  270 bps below the avg  move   Canacord Genuity analysts are more bullish on the stock heading into earnings  Already with a buy rating on the stock  they boosted their price target to  92 from  87 Monday ahead of earnings   Weekend store checks confirm LULU has begun restocking stores with the Astro and Groove yoga pants   two of the three styles that were recalled in mid March  the Wonder Under crops have yet to be restocked   This timing is consistent with our note from April 22 in which our supply chain checks indicated LULU would be restocking the recalled Luon pants in early June  As such  we continue to believe Q2 comps will benefit from pent up demand    Not only is the impact to the brand from the recall expected to be negligible  we believe LULU benefited from increased traffic and substitute purchases  As such  we expect to see upside to our Q1 estimates when the company reports Q1 results on June 10  We reiterate our BUY and are raising our target to  92 from  87 based on a 35x P E multiple that is more consistent with its growth rate   Canaccord Genuity expects Lululemon to report first quarter EPS of  0 30 on revenue of  335 8 million  roughly in line with Wall Street forecasts  Navistar Heavy vehicle manufacturer Navistar is also expected to release earnings Monday  The company is expected to report a loss of  1 20 per share in the quarter on revenue of  2 88 billion  In the second quarter last year  Navistar earned  0 67 per share on revenue of  3 3 billion  J P  Morgan analysts commented on the stock Friday ahead of earnings  They reiterated their overweight rating on the stock ahead of the earnings   Navistar will report earnings Monday afternoon after the close   4PM   with a conference call at 4 30PM ET  NAV s FQ2 13 is expected to be messy  with improvement expected in FH2 13 as the new 13 L engine was launched at the end of April  EBITDA is expected to be flattish  and cash burn is expected to be   100MM   200MM on the back of restructuring expenses and pension contributions    Key risks to FQ2 results include ongoing costs related to the Garland plant closure and field campaigns to repair existing issues on older engines  NAV s Class 8 production was slightly higher than JPMe  though market share was slightly below as engine offerings remained in transition  We continue to expect market share to be bumpy as new offerings roll out  J P  Morgan forecasts a loss per share of  1 09 and revenue of  3 0 billion  both higher than Wall Street estimates  The analysts note three key questions that need to be answered 1  How are customers responding to the new 13 L offering 2  How far along is the cost reduction program 3  Have any new cash needs arisen that might affect near term cash burn Jefferies reiterated its buy rating and  45 price target on Navistar earlier this week  They forecast a wider loss per share than the street of  1 16 per share on revenue of  2 9 billion  Last quarter  NAV realized EBITDA of  57 mln  versus the guidance of   50    50 mln and ended the quarter with  1 189 mln in cash versus guidance of  950  1 050 mln  Our EBITDA forecast for F2Q is  39 mln  but we don t include a possible warranty campaign of  25 mln or so as timing remains uncertain  We believe management will provide guidance for F3Q  which should show a slight sequential improvement in EBITDA   Our  45 PT applies an average historical multiple to our FY13 sales   32  EV Sales  However  we continue to see significant upside when uncertainty fades  Risks  another downturn in the North American truck market  as well as potential lack of adoption of NAV s enhanced EGR engine technology  PVH Corp The maker of brands such as Calvin Klein and Izod is expected to report earnings Wednesday after the close  Analysts forecast earnings per share of  1 35  higher than the  1 30 reported in the same period last year  Revenue is expected to rise to 1 91 billion from 1 43 billion a year ago Bank of America re assumed coverage of the company in April with a neutral rating and a  115 price target  They forecast earnings per share of  1 33  slightly below the street as they fear the recent Warnaco acquisition will negatively weigh on earnings  Given near term revenue   expense headwinds following the Warnaco acquisition  completed 2 13 13  we see limited 2013 EPS upside  Our  115 PO is based on 14x our F15  Jan   operating EPS estimate of  8 20 and is supported by our DCF analysis  assumes a 7 8  expected return and 7 5x terminal EBITDA multiple    Cost synergies are still expected to reach  100MM over 4 years now  instead of 3  as PVH makes incremental investments in WRC s infrastructure  Calvin Klein Jeanswear product   design quality  in store marketing  and talent  new heads of Europe   Asia being recruited   Expected WRC EPS dilution of   0 25  in F14  reduced from previous   0 35 accretion  also reflects mark downs associated with global CK inventory rationalization  particularly the CK Jeanswear business    PVH sales thru 2013 should be pressured by   1  the impact of global CK inventory clearance on sell thru of current CK goods   2  plans to reduce CK off price distribution by  40 50MM over the next 2 years   3  continued weakness in Heritage  particularly Bass outlets   and  4  the loss of the  Chaps  license   250MM sales   J P  Morgan has PVH at a neutral rating and has a slightly higher price target at  120   We are setting our quarterly 2013E EPS estimates for PVH following 4Q12 Earnings  We estimate 1Q13E EPS of  1 33  2Q13E EPS of  1 36  3Q13E EPS of  2 53  and 4Q13E EPS of  1 82  For 2013E  we adjust our estimate from  7 45 to  7 05  We are lowering out FY14 estimate from  8 60 to  8 25   We believe the WRC acquisition is a game changer longer term with a united  House of Calvin Klein  and ability to expand Tommy to underpenetrated  higher growth Asia and South American markets attractive  in our view  Incorporating 6 8  revenue growth and mid to high teens EPS growth  we see potential for  10  11 in EPS in FY15  That said  we see FY13 as a  transition  year with SG A investments  systems  distribution  marketing  potentially offsetting transaction

timeline for the Federal Reserve to ratchet down its stimulus programs  The multi year rally in risk assets has been driven in large part by huge liquidity injections from the Fed and other central banks  and investors worry about economic growth in the absence of these programs   Given the run up in the major averages in 2013  the markets are also vulnerable to profit taking bouts in the absence of good news  Sentiment has been turning bearish in recent days  and a triple digit decline on Wednesday saw the Dow close below 15 000   Major Averages The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell

 Ramesh Srinivasan  President and Chief Executive Officer of Agilysys  Ramesh  please go ahead Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Dave and good afternoon everyone  Welcome to our fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings call  Joining Dave and me on the call today is Tony Pritchett  our CFO  We re pleased to report that we completed yet another strong quarter  highlighted by revenue of  42 million  a 17     17  increase over Q3 of last year with record revenue across all three received lines  recurring revenue  product revenue  and professional services revenue  With respect to overall quarterly revenue  this is our ninth consecutive sequential revenue increase  seventh consecutive record revenue  and sixth consecutive double digit year over year revenue increase quarter Recurring revenue was a record  21 million  led by a 28  year over year growth in subscription revenue  Our customer s satisfaction levels continue to improve  As a result  customer churn as a percentage of recurring revenue continues to decline significantly year over year  as has being the case the past couple of years  That improving metric continues to validate our organizational improvements across all aspects of our business  especially in product development  professional services  and customer support Professional services revenue for Q3 fiscal 2020 was a record  8 9 million  This was our second consecutive record revenue quarter in professional services  As we mentioned in our last call  professional services is a good measure of how busy we are with various software implementations all across the globe and is therefore a good leading indicator of the overall strength of our business  especially our future growth of recurring revenue  Due to changing customer preferences  an increasing number of new customer software implementations involve subscription revenue arrangements Our selling momentum continues to be strong with our global selling success in Q3 fiscal 2020 being one of our best ever  Please note  we use the word sales  selling and bookings to mean new product and services sale arrangements with customers  while revenue is  of course  recognized revenue  In many other places  the word sales and revenue tend to be used interchangeably  while it means different things for us  For us  sales this quarter will partially effect the current quarter revenue and also contribute toward building future recurring revenue  product revenue  and services revenue backlog With the exception of one quarter  way back in fiscal 2016  which contained a couple of significant deals  The last five quarters have been our five best selling quarters ever  This has helped build our revenue backlog significantly  making our revenue growth increasingly more consistent and predictable  In addition  the last six quarter through Q3 of this fiscal year have been our sixth best subscription booking quarters on record  which offers well for our continued subscription revenue growth During Q3 fiscal 2020  we added 18 new customers to our family  Our international momentum continues to grow  Q3 this fiscal year was a record sales quarter for us in the APAC region and was our second best overall international sales quarter  To a large extent  our current sales and revenue growth is still being led by our market leading point of sale  POS solutions  InfoGenesis and rGuest Buy Kiosk  Alongside  our star performer InfoGenesis which for the most part handles POS staff facing software solutions  rGuest Buy Kiosk  which handles the growing demand for guest facing kiosk and other functionality requirements continues to build momentum in the market place with increasing instances of competitive systems being replaced in employee cafeterias in multiple  large and prestigious workplace campuses all across the US While our POS solutions by themselves are good enough to drive our revenue and profitability levels further forward at a significant pace for the foreseeable future  we continue to improve our property management systems  PMS offerings  Several of our new logo wins during Q3 fiscal 2020 included PMS software solutions as well  We ve also had good success during the past couple of years  building a set of emerging products  which are ancillary software modules which work in conjunction with and adds strength to the core POS and PMS products Especially on the PMS side of the equation  there is a major industry need for well integrated solutions  which can bring together the world of core PMS with modules like direct channel web based booking systems  mobile check in  check out  kiosk check in  check out  guest loyalty management  service optimization to better manage various hospitality tasks and operations  and spa  golf and other guest activities management software We have several customers sites as already implemented such modules integrated with the core PMS products also provided by us  resulting in significant improvements in operational efficiency  guest experience  and guest satisfaction  While there are many completing POS vendors in the marketplace today  there are far fewer major PMS providers  And a number of providers who are actually trying to create fully integrated model of PMS ancillary modules is even fewer Customers are increasingly inclined to use as few vendors as possible to get such integrated software solutions from and that s a trend which is favorable to our product and strategy direction  We have now sold close to 100 deals containing a huge one of these emerging product modules with about half of them coming just in the past six months  Thanks to these additional software products  Our average deal size is increasing and more crucial than that our competitive advantage is increasing with no comparable competing vendors as intensely focused as we are in providing end to end software solutions and delivering a fully integrated technology platform to serve the full breadth of hospitality operators and their evolving guests engagement to ecosystem Customers in this industry have starved for such progress and are steadily rewarding us for being the partner they can depend on for both day to day rate execution and industry leading innovation  With respect to US domestic markets during Q3 fiscal 2020 in the gaming vertical  Fortune Bay Resort Casino located in Minnesota  and the Grand River Casino and Resort located in South Dakota invested in both our PMS and POS solutions  along with a couple of other software models  while the Sky Dancer Casino and Resort recently purchased our rGuest Stay PMS solution to run their lodging operations In addition  we significantly expanded our POS business partnership with one of our largest gaming customers during the quarter  In addition to our historical strength in the gaming  hotel resorts and cruises  and traditional managed foodservice verticals  During the last couple of quarters  we ve also made good breakthroughs into renewed areas of focus in managed food service  higher education and healthcare During Q3 fiscal 2020  we had new customer wins in this segment  including Longwood University  Virginia and another healthcare facility in Texas  Backed by a stable management team with senior executives  who have all been with us for a while now  all of them wonderful team players  who are passionate about the company and the huge potential we have before us  We continue to make good progress with all the business initiatives we started on a couple three years ago We started this fiscal year with annual revenue guidance of 11  growth over the prior year   141 million level then increased it during our last call to 14   which we now are increasing to 16     16   We continue to expect this significant revenue growth to also be accompanied by a strong adjusted EBITDA profitability year over year growth of 25   Our adjusted EBITDA for Q3 fiscal 2020 was  3 2 million  which is close to record levels Encouraged by our successes during the past couple of years  we continue to increase our R D resource strength to drive home our widening competitive advantage without any significant increase in R D costs as a percentage of revenue  Our R D teams are currently about 730 personnel strong compared to about 230 at the beginning of calendar 2017  This increase has afforded us the ability to strengthen and modernize our core products quicker and more effectively  while also increasing innovation levels  creating well integrated  additional high value software modules  which face much less competition in the marketplace  and it s helping us focus on our long term  top line and bottom line growth strategies In summary  they are hitting our stride operationally as a small company with a big realistic vision and the resources necessary to execute and innovate consistently well  We understand well the nuances and operational realities of disciplined profitable revenue growth  There is a high demand in the growing hospitality industry  we are currently and intensely focused on for the kind of integrated software solutions  we continue to create and enhance  We are beginning to see the results of having a solid good team in place  which is well positioned to significantly outperform the competition with great innovation  We look forward to talking to all of you again in about four months from now  when we will be reporting our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and end of fiscal year results With that  let me hand over the call to our CFO  Tony Pritchett for more color on our financial results and future outlook  Tony Tony Pritchett    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ramesh  We re happy that our business momentum continued into the fiscal 2020 third quarter  We re hitting our stride with respect to the plan we set out on three years ago  obtaining this company into a consistently profitable top line growth company  The fact that this quarter was our sixth consecutive quarter of double digit year over year revenue growth with strong adjusted EBITDA to back it up  is solid evidence of that  We are focused on delivering the best most reliable products to our customers and supporting our customers ever changing business needs  and we are confident that this will continue to drive our success Looking at our financial results  third quarter fiscal 2020 revenue was a record  42 million  or 17  higher than total net revenue of  36 million in the prior year period  This quarter s  42 million in revenue is made up of record revenue in all three revenue categories of our income statement  the fact that we re understandably proud of  The increase in our top line was driven by an 18 5  increase in product revenue to  12 1 million and 8 4  increase in recurring revenue to  21 million  and a 38 2  increase in professional services revenue to  8 9 million I want to highlight that the 8 4  recurring revenue growth includes subscription revenue growth of 28  for the quarter  Subscription revenue comprised approximately 38  of total recurring revenue  compared to 32  of total recurring revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  Total recurring revenue represented 49 9  of total net revenue for the fiscal third quarter  compared to 53 7  of total net revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2019  It is important to keep in mind that this drop in recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue is not a negative fact for our business  This is a representation of strong business momentum and selling success Our product revenue remains consistently strong  growing sequentially  as well as year over year  And increasing professional services revenue is a leading indicator of future growth for our total recurring and subscription revenue  We continue to feel that subscription revenue growth rates on an annual basis will remain above 20   The trailing 12 month growth rate is just over 22   With regard to endpoints  we currently service approximately 274 000 rooms and approximately 61 000 point of sale endpoints  reflecting an increase of 1  and 15  respectively  compared to Q3 of last year Moving down the income statement  total gross profit was  21 1 million  representing a 13  increase from  18 6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019  The increase in gross profit is the results of growth across all three revenue line items  Gross profit margin was 50 2  compare to 51 8  in the third quarter of fiscal 2019  Total gross profit margin is down slightly compared to last year due to the acceleration of selling momentum  as mentioned earlier  which results in converting product and professional services contracts to revenue in the near term As indicated by our increased top line guidance from 14  to 16   total revenue is a little better than expected this year  This acceleration of revenue growth starts with product and professional services revenue is that is the flow of revenue with our deals  Product revenue is recognized first shortly after contract signature  Professional services revenue is next  as we implement the systems we now delivered  and then recurring revenue begins  As our selling momentum continues and with revenue growing faster than expected  our gross profit margins are going to be less than planned since product revenue and professional services revenue had lower margins then our consolidated results  As such  we announced that gross profit margins for fiscal 2020 to be slightly less than those of fiscal 2019 Moving on to operating expenses  excluding charges for legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges  the third quarter saw a 5 7  increase in operating expenses to  23 7 million that compares to  22 5 million in the prior year period  This increase is in line with our operating plan to increase costs at a slower pace than we increase revenue  Combined our three main operating expense line items  product development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and general and administrative expenses were 53  of revenue this quarter  compared to 59  of revenue during Q3 of fiscal 2019  The increase in the same operating expense lines combined was only 5  while revenue increased to 17   There s still much work to be done and many more opportunities to grow  As such  we will continue to invest in the business including an R D  SaaS operations  customer services and support  while maintaining our focus to increase costs well below the pace of revenue growth Operating loss of  2 7 million for the third quarter is an improvement compared to an operating loss of  3 9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019  Net loss for the third quarter was  2 6 million or  0 11 per diluted share  favorably comparing to a loss of  4 million or  0 18 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2019  You will note that we have included the non GAAP measures  adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share in our earnings release this quarter We feel that considering income before these non cash and non recurring charges results in an EPS measure that is a meaningful representation of earnings available to common shareholders on an ongoing basis  It is important to remember that our amortization expense  which is significant now  starts to taper off starting in fiscal 2022  our fiscal year after next  Less than half of our current run rate of amortization will remain in fiscal 2022 and then less than 10  will remain in fiscal 2024Moving to the balance sheet  Cash and marketable securities as of December 31  2019 was  41 9 million  compared to  40 8 million at March 31  2019 and compared to  37 million at December 31  2018  As it relates to our cash flow  we reported net cash provided by operating activities of  5 3 million during the third quarter  compared to  1 7 million of net cash provided during Q3 of fiscal 2019  a  3 6 million improvement  Our free cash flow for the nine months ended December 31  2019 is  4 3 million better than the comparable prior year  These cash flow results indicate that we are on track for our expectations of significantly improved free cash flow this year over last During the fiscal 2020 first quarter  we recorded a right of used asset on our balance sheet within current assets and an operating lease liability  which is split between current and long term liabilities  These balances are the result of our implementation of ASC 842  the new lease accounting standard that became effective for us in the first quarter of this fiscal year  This new accounting standard requires companies to record liabilities  which were previously off balance sheet obligations and the associated assets onto the balance sheet  There is no impact to the income statement classification of rent expense or depreciation expense for us For the fiscal 2020 third quarter  adjusted EBITDA was  3 2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of  2 1 million in the year ago quarter  We continue to carry approximately  220 million of NOL carry forwards with a full valuation allowance on our books that will enable us to remain liable for taxes only in certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future  Our NOLs that are subject to expiration expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2038  As it relates to our guidance  given the continued improvements across our business  we are confident in raising our guidance for fiscal 2020 year over year revenue growth from 14  to 16   compared to full year fiscal 2019 revenue of approximately  141 million We continue to expect an approximate 25  improvement in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2020  compared to fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA of about  10 million  The reason  we are again not raising adjusted EBITDA guidance is that  given the increased business momentum we are currently enjoying  we have made some continued investments and accelerating our R D  professional services  and customer support strength  Please keep in mind that fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA of  10 3 million had the benefit of about  2 2 million of capitalized software costs  which did not occur in fiscal 2020 Growing adjusted EBITDA by 25  between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 is actually the equivalent of growing adjusted EBITDA by 60   if we remove the  2 2 million capitalization benefit from the prior year  That 60  improvement on revenue growth of 16   reflects the significant operating leverage  we continue to work with  as we manage expense related investments carefully to continue to support future profitable revenue growth We re excited about what the future holds for Agilysys and the hospitality industry  Customers repeatedly confirms to us that they re hungry for a world class vendor that can provide a fully integrated suite of solutions  and they equally confirm they are impressed with how we continue to innovate and progress toward that challenge  We are executing well against our strategic plan  a plan that was set out three years ago and remains materially the same to this day Our financial results were strong this quarter  but more importantly  the longer term financial trends we have reported are strong and we feel the business is set up well for the future  We will continue to focus  work hard  and deliver the products and services our customers want With that  I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions  Sheri Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from George Sutton with Craig Hallum George Sutton    Craig Hallum Capital Group    AnalystThank you  and congratulations on the results  I m curious  when we do due diligence we    and talk to existing and potential customers  what we find is a competitor systems being replaced is a fairly slow process  and you mentioned this quarter  you actually saw a fair bit of that  I m curious is there certain functionality or foreign types that are the appeal that s causing that change to be made Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Hi  George  Thank you for joining the call  This    the competitive replacements picking up  we ve been noticing the trend for quite a few quarters now  I would say for the last four or five quarters  The rate at which we ve been replacing major competitive systems because that is what we keep track of replacing major competitive systems has really picked up  And they don t necessarily take too much time  George  There have been cases where a customer has contacted us and they have gone live with our product like a couple of months later  Now  some of the things that trigger that is    there could be a competitor system for whom a hardware refresh is coming up  on the POS side  And while they are spending that kind of money on that refresh they start thinking  why don t we go look for a system  That could be one The other thing that very often happens is they want certain enhancements done to help their business and very often a lot of those vendors just don t have the engineering breadth and wherewithal to get those changes done quickly  They will want an interface created with another system that they have bought that many competing vendors just don t do and that becomes a compelling event for them to change the system  And their business could expand for which the other vendor may not be able to keep up I don t think these decisions take too much time George based on our experience  but there are cases where  let s say  they are marginally like another system  But they are quite happy with their current system  but they would really like to have a competing system that could take time  They might wait for a year or so before they really make that decision  But when there are compelling events and there are many  especially with many vendors not doing great customer support  These kinds of things do tend to happen a lot faster than probably what you re sample size is shown George Sutton    Craig Hallum Capital Group    AnalystPerfect  Thank you  And your product strength and your professional services strength  which has been a consistent thing for us to see  Can you give us a sense on  is that something we should continue to expect for a period of time or we re going to start to see the subscription side of it really start to show that benefit Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s the product and services trends that you re seeing will lead to recurring revenue and subscription revenue strength  So  like how Tony described in his prepared remarks  What comes first is the product revenue  So as part of a sale  given the nature of our POS business a certain amount of hardware comes with it  a certain amount of services revenue comes with it  That s the first thing that happens  And then as we go implement and the customer wants more activities from us  The services revenue picks up and that s a good indicator of the fact we are doing a lot of implementations now  We are taking    we are replacing a lot of competitor systems and we are doing a lot of new product installs of customers who already have other product  So as a services activity picks up as we are seeing in the last six months that leads to recurring revenue So those customers go live and the recurring revenue  you should expect will pick up and it just so happens that more and more of our customers are preferring subscription based arrangements  We don t force them into that  We want to be customer centric  and we try to do what the customer wants us to do  It just so happens more and more customers want software solutions based on the cloud and subscription base arrangements  So as you    the product revenue is a good indicator that our business is doing well  We are doing a lot of sale    selling now  Services revenue is a good indicator that we are doing a lot of implementations  And in turn that will lead to recurring revenue in the future  and it just so happens a good portion of the implementations we are doing happen to be SaaS subscription basis George Sutton    Craig Hallum Capital Group    AnalystGot you  Lastly  if I could  Tony may be helpful  because I ve had a few client questions last few days on the potential virus impact on your PMS business  Obviously  I understand the model  but I m not sure most people understand what limited impact you might see if travel were reduce Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  limited impact on our business  but before that George  we do have employees in the Shenzhen and Hong Kong area  So we are very concerned about this because employee well being comes number one for us and we care about all our global employees a lot  So we are very concerned about our employees in Shenzhen and Hong Kong and to a certain extent Singapore as well and Malaysia  We have a number of employees there  So we are very concerned about their well being  Phonetic  and so far so good  They have not been effective  We are nowhere close to the affected region  So we are closely monitoring it and keeping a tab on that  And we are taking very safe decisions as far as travel and anything else is concerned  So that s the employee part of the answer  which is our number one concern now As far as business is concerned  we have more than 4 000 properties all over the world  who are currently using our system property sites  of which only 20 are in China at the moment  Our China is an initial business for us now  We have a lot of growth potential there  but we have traditionally  historically not had a major presence there  So we only have 20 properties live there  And there are about 20 other new selling opportunities that we are working on many properties of them belong to one or two big hotel chains that we are working with  So it is possible that those deals get postponed  due to travel and other restrictions  So when you think about possible revenue impact  may be a  500 000 revenue impact in Q4 and on this fiscal year is possible for us  It is not significant at the moment  but we are watching it carefully  It is not a major part of our business George Sutton    Craig Hallum Capital Group    AnalystThanks  guys OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from Tyler Wood with Northland Securities Tyler Wood    Northland Securities    AnalystThanks for taking our questions  First one for Ramesh  You talked about increasing success selling modules into your existing customers  maybe could you drill down a little bit more into that  what specific modules are you seeing  having the most impact there  And then going forward  what do you see being the most important modules for drive a growth Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  good to talk to you  Tyler  Thank you for joining the call  So the modules  let s break them up into POS and PMS separately  So as far as POS is concerned  the two main flagship products that we have are InfoGenesis  which is more staff facing solutions  and rGuest Express Kiosk  which is more guest facing kiosks  where the guests can self help where they can order food items directly from a kiosk  And it just speeds up a lot of queues and other things and employee cafeterias Now there we have an additional product call on demand  which helps you order the food from either your desktop  So imagine you are in the 15th floor of a building and it s 11 30 in the morning and you re getting ready to order lunch  You can order it from your desktop or you can order it from your phone as well    from your smartphone  So you re sitting in a hotel room  you can order for food items from the phone and it will even give you details of exactly how many minutes they can serve you the food  depending on what kind of pressure there is in the kitchen  So that on demand product is an additional software module  which is a good margin module for us  That many of our POS customers are considering and a few of them have already purchased Now on the PMS side of the business  on the hotel management system  property management system side of the business  there are a number of products that are already getting good traction in the industry  Like  one of them is a direct channel web booking system  So customers have always wanted a web booking system that is PMS aware that can differentiate you from being a platinum player versus the silver player  Customers have always wanted that  because most web booking systems that are out there involve commissions and they are not PMS aware  so that is one module  That has already gone live with about five or six customers already Then the other one is mobile check in  check out  So that you don t need to go to the reception counter stand in a queue  Right from your smartphone  you can get a digital key and you can directly walk to your room or you can do other check in check out facilities  Instead of going to the reception counter you can also walk to a kiosk  So a couple of customers  a couple of big customers have already gone live with that  Then we introduced a product call rGuest Service  which basically optimizes all the tasks and operations in the hotel  So if you are running a hotel that there are just a lot of things happening in the hotel  lot of tasks  including housekeeping tasks that you are assigned to various people and if somebody doesn t react quickly it should automatically get escalated to a supervisor  So that product completely automated to solve that and it integrates well with PMS and POS So there is a number of software modules like that  that we are creating now that is adding strength to POS and PMS  And very often when you go to our competing vendors they will point you to a third party company that will do that module  Quite for us  the advantage is  because of our R D strength  we can do it ourselves and it s also much better integrated with all our core products Tyler Wood    Northland Securities    AnalystThanks  That s helpful  And I guess going back to the competitive displacements question  You mentioned kind of a factor that could get people switches POS refresh  Is there any kind of  developments you see on the horizon  be it pay a table or something like that  that would    a new feature that could sort of spur people into having to refresh those Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So Tyler  I can t give you one magic bullet like you create one module and suddenly tips a scale over  All these additional modules  right  including pay a table  which one of our biggest gaming customers went live with recently and that is an additional thing we support now  You keep adding all these modules  You keep modernizing your core product  You keep adding more functionality to your core product  And somewhere along the line  the scale tilts in your favor  And with each customer  how much weight does it take to tilt a scale varies  I can t give you one magic module that now that we have that everybody has to go to us  It doesn t happen that way  We keep adding these competitive advantage trends  And for different customers  that tilting of the scale happens at different times  right  or for different reasons  Like  there is no one magic module that s going to create it  But as we keep doing all this R D innovation work  it keeps tilting more and more toward our favor Tyler Wood    Northland Securities    AnalystAll right  Thanks  That s all from me Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Tyler OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ishfaque Faruk with Sidoti Ishfaque Faruk    Sidoti    AnalystHi  Congrats  guys on the great results  A couple of questions from me  Ramesh  you said you guys got around 18 new customers this quarter  Can you give a sense for how many of those had added PMS solutions Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think out of the 18 new logos  new customers we won  I think the PMS number is four  if I m not mistaken  Once  we finish this call  Ishfaque  I ll    Tony and Dave will confirm that number for you  but I think the number is four Ishfaque Faruk    Sidoti    AnalystGreat  And Ramesh  you also said that you re seeing your average deal size increasing would reduce churn in terms of more competition  Can you give a sense of like how much you ve seen maybe your average deal size growing relatively maybe on a year over year basis Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  Ishfaque  I don t think    the three separate things that you mentioned  Ishfaque  average deal size has to do with the fact that when you go sell a product now there are three other modules we can sell in that same deal  which very often the customer picks up  And we don t measure it exactly my average deal size  but we do keep track of how many of our deals more than 50k per  Phonetic  and how many of our deals are less than 50k per  And the number    the value of these deals now selling about 50k per deal have increased  It s now at record levels  That s much we continue  but we can t give you an exact number on that Customers churn that you mentioned is an entirely different matter  right  That is a matter of regaining the customers we have  And that is because we service the customers better  now we support them better  And customers normally stay with you when they see you innovating and moving the products forward  So more and more our customer retention is world class levels now  our customer churn is going down  And then new customer  when is of course is an entirely different matter that we already talked about Ishfaque Faruk    Sidoti    AnalystOkay  And last one from me  Tony  I think you mentioned that your R D group went up to as much as a 738  Phonetic   I believe  Do you guys expect that to flatten out at some point or you expect that to move a little higher Tony Pritchett    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Hey  Ishfaque  We do expect the R D team to continue growing on an absolute headcount basis  The R D team will continue to expand from the 730 number that we mentioned  The way to think about R D from a financial modeling perspective though  is that  this fiscal year you should see R D pretty close on an annual basis as a percentage of revenue to last year  It s in the 27   28  of revenue range  That s a pretty reasonable number to expect going forward for the near term Looking into next year  we don t expect any major shifts in that as a percentage of revenue  In out years  past next year  you d likely to start seeing that number tick down as a percentage of revenue  But yeah  we ll continue to expand the team as far as headcount goes  But again  we do that smartly as revenue increases and as the business support the need  And again  percentage of revenue is really where we focus from that perspective Ishfaque Faruk    Sidoti    AnalystThanks  guys  Congrats  once again on a great quarter Tony Pritchett    Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Allen Klee with National Securities Allen Klee    National Securities    AnalystYes  Hi  My questions on the PMS side  The growth there has been relatively modest for a while now  and I m just trying to understand what has to change to accelerate that  And how do you think about the timing of what it would take to get that to double digits  Thank you Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Allen  Good question  Allen  Hey  good to talk to you  Yes  the PMS side of it is  is actually less than modest right  So  that is the core worry that is the biggest elephant in the room for us  And we are improving the product  those products are getting better  Now what you see in the room count that Tony gives you is after implementation  So for example  the four or so customers we have signed this quarter  we have not yet implemented them  They have not yet gone live  So  they will add to the room count in the next quarter  that room count we give you is not a sold room count  but an implemented room count  So that will improve over time But to answer your question  there is still more product work to be done  right  in fact Ishfaque s question about R D expanding  we are expanding our R D will continue to do so for the foreseeable future while keeping it as a percentage of revenue at the same or levels below where we are today  But we still have some more product work to finish on the PMS side  before we have the kind of competitive advantage that we currently have with the POS side of the business In the meanwhile  we are also adding all these additional software modules  which    when the core product work gets done will put us in a very  very good spot where our competitive advantage in PMS will also be as big as it is in POS today  So  growing the PMS side of our business has a lot of our focus now Allen  And in terms of taking are revenue and shareholder value and all that to great levels  PMS will start contributing in the next few quarters Allen Klee    National Securities    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then in the guidance  it was mentioned that you re keeping your EBITDA guidance and you would mentioned that that s due to reinvesting some of the higher revenue  Could you maybe give some details of what that s being reinvested in Tony Pritchett    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  Allen as we mentioned  I mean  it s a consistent message last quarter and this quarter as well  where we ve seen some opportunity this year is to invest in our SaaS infrastructure  We ve seen a lot of growth with our SaaS implementations  and we obviously have a lot of new products coming on  So  there s some SaaS infrastructure investments that we ve done as well as the R D team as we ve talked the decent amount about already And then  with customer facing services personnel and support personnel  there s been some additional headcount added there as well  just to support    continue to support our customers as well as we can  So that we can help address all of their issues  post implementation and any support all the go live that are happening  But as you can see  our professional services revenue is growing  that comes from the services team that we ve built  And that s where most of the investment that we ve talked about I mentioned and that we ve invested this fiscal year Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd also Allen  as Tony mentioned in his prepared remarks  even though  we re saying that adjusted EBITDA is growing by 25  this year from  10 million or so it was last year  If you remove the  2 2 million software capitalization advantage FY  19 had  it s actually a 60  increase in EBITDA    60   So while you grow revenue by 16  that we are guiding to now  growing EBITDA by 60  is quite significant operating leverage  We don t want to overdo that because we want to make sure our focus is on growing the top line as well  So  we are balancing that out about as best as we can Allen Klee    National Securities    AnalystThank you  And then last question on professional services  which has been growing very fast  Can you help us understand like  how    if you win some business  the timing that it takes to implement  And are you uncomfortable with how long it takes and you get paid up front for that or is there an issue of paid or is that an area that you think that you have to put more resources into  Thank you very much Tony Pritchett    Chief Financial OfficerSo  as far as the payment goes Allen  for professional services  just as a general rule  all of our one time items that are in a contract  As a general rule  we usually collect 50  of that upfront  That s pretty standard in the industry and generally  that s what we experience as well  Of course  there are certain customers that there s exceptions made for that  etc  But generally speaking  50  of our one time items upfront and that includes professional services Now  as far as the timing goes of getting installations done  the way to think about that is usually    and again  this is a broad generalization  but usually we can sign a contract  This quarter  the product revenue would come in  this quarter  the professional services would come in a quarter after that  and then the recurring revenue would start coming in a quarter after that  If you re looking at    generally speaking  it s about a three month lead time from contract signature to implementation  We re pretty happy with that  It s a pretty good balance at this point  And we ve got the ability to get customers implemented faster  if they need that  Some customers push out implementations longer than that  So  it s a pretty good balance from that perspective  So we re happy with the level that we ve got now Now  as revenue grows as professional services revenue grows  certainly we re going to have to increase the size of the services team  But we feel like profession services margins in the range they re at today  high 20s  mid to high 20s  is reasonable to expect going forward  So  we don t expect those margins to come down because we have to add people Allen Klee    National Securities    AnalystOkay  Actually  could I sneak in one more question Tony Pritchett    Chief Financial OfficerSure Allen Klee    National Securities    AnalystOkay  Thank you  I know you re having your user conference next week  And I was just wondering  kind of what you think that is going to be kind of the focus or there may be something new that you think is important to happen there Tony Pritchett    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  There s    Allen  there s no special one time thing you are expecting in terms of any major announcement or anything like that  So all our customers getting together in the user conference is mostly to give them an update of all the product improvements that have happened in the past 12 months and all the product roadmap  the future improvements that are coming in the next 12 months Now why that is important for us is that a lot of our customers use either only one of our products or maybe they use two of our products  and now we have a lot more modules and products to offer  So for example  if the POS customer it is important  they understand how much advancements we made in the PMS area and vice versa  And if there is already a PMS customer  they should know all the other modules that we have to offer And the advantages  there will be another customer there  who is actually use that module and who can tell them the kind of return on investment they are getting out of those modules  So there s a lot of shared knowledge among the customers that normally works out very well for us  And also in terms of some of the challenges that they have  they can share with each other as to how the challenge for one of those customers has got sorted out  So that s a major part of it And we have breakout sessions where we also do training programs  where customers want to get more in depth training on the products  So  we do that as well  So  it s an excellent gathering of hundreds of customer users  And it also helps us improve our relationships with them  give them both resources updates and there is a company is going  and share with them all those details  So  it s a very powerful event for us that we do once a year that brings our customer base together  and that is a big part of our business growth for us  But no particular  there is no major announcement or anything we are planning at that time  It s a fairly routine once a year event for us Allen Klee    National Securities    AnalystThank you so much Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Allen OperatorThank you  I m showing no further questions at this time  I will now turn the call back over to Ramesh for any further remarks Ramesh Srinivasan    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Sheri  Thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your continued interest and support  Agilysys continues to be well positioned to increase shareholder value
