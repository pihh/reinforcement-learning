3852,225367,APA,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Schlumberger s Q4  Eni s Agogo Start Up   More,opinion,"It was a week where oil futures settled lower and natural gas prices fell to their lowest level since May 2016 
On the news front  oilfield service major Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   reported upbeat fourth quarter earnings on strength in its international operations  Meanwhile  Italian energy behemoth Eni S p A    NYSE E   announced the flow of first oil from the Agogo field  offshore Angola 
Overall  it was a pretty bad week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures suffered a loss of 0 9  to close at  58 54 per barrel  while natural gas prices slumped 9  for the week to finish at 2 003 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The crude benchmark fell for the second week in a row after the U S  government reported large increases in gasoline and distillate stockpiles  Prices were also pressured by data showing drillers in the United States adding oil rigs  thus pointing to signs of rising domestic supplies  Weak economic growth numbers from China brought further downside 
Meanwhile  the negative price movement was more pronounced for natural gas even as the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a larger than expected decrease in supplies  The bullish sentiment was overwhelmed by mild winter weather forecasts amid strong production  which led prices to trickle down to their lowest level in more than three and a half years 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
1   Schlumberger s fourth quarter 2019 earnings of 39 cents per share  excluding charges and credits  surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents  The bottom line also increased from 36 cents a year ago  The increase in Surface Systems  Drilling Systems  OneSubsea revenues in the international markets along with strong SIS digital software sales backed the company s strong quarterly results 
As of Dec 31  2019  the company had approximately  2 167 million in cash and short term investments plus  14 770 million in long term debt  This represented a debt to capitalization ratio of 38 8   Schlumberger projects 2020 capital expenditure at  1 7 billion  suggesting no change from 2018 spending 
The oilfield service firm added that North American land drilling will experience significant contraction in 2020  To tide over this headwind  Schlumberger will look to improve margins by concentrating on execution and management of the controllable factors  including workforce reduction  asset sales  etc    Meanwhile  the company is witnessing broad based  strong growth in its international business   Read more  
2    Eni recently started production from the Agogo oilfield  located offshore Angola  Notably  the production commencement in the 15 06 block occurred only nine months following its discovery  It was supported by operational synergies from the Floating Production Storage Offloading  FPSO  vessel Ngoma  located just 15 kilometres away from the oilfield 
The Agogo 1 well was drilled at a water depth of approximately 1700 meters and currently produces 10 000 barrels of oil per day  The output is expected to double in the next few weeks  The oilfield is anticipated to have 650 million barrels of oil  Encouragingly  new delineation wells will be drilled to uphold the field s further potential  The company s initiatives to start production in just nine months  with the help of existing infrastructures that maximize project value  are commendable 
The company  along with joint venture partners  Sonangol and SSI Fifteen  had launched a new exploration program in the block in second half 2018  The exploration campaign led to five new discoveries that are expected to hold 2 billion barrels of oil 
These developments strengthened Eni s footprint in the region and boosted organic growth  The company is the operator in the block with a 36 8421  stake  Its equity production from Angola currently stands at around 145 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day   Read more  
3    The U S  Treasury Department permitted Chevron   NYSE CVX   to continue with its operations in Venezuela for three more months until April 22 despite U S  sanctions on the country in crisis  This is the fourth waiver from the Trump administration since sanctions were announced in Nov 2018 
Even though Chevron has a long standing presence in Venezuela  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company incurred a loss of  104 million from its Venezuela operations during the first three quarters of 2019 and is feared to lose  2 7 billion worth of assets if required to leave the country  If the sanctions were not extended  Chevron s exit would follow close on the heels of various other U S  entities that bade adieu to Venezuela 
You can see  
While the Venezuelan business represents a very small portion of Chevron s extensive global portfolio  its departure from the country would have surely dented earnings  On Chevron s exit from the country  the Venezuelan government certainly had to nationalize its oil assets and the company would have to suffer write downs 
If the waivers lapsed and Chevron is forced to bow out  it may find it difficult to resume its relationship with the South American nation even if U S  Venezuela ties are on the mend despite the country s crumbling energy infrastructure   Read more  
4    EQT Corporation   NYSE EQT   recently provided a guidance update on fourth quarter 2019 operations and 2020 capital expenditure 
EQT Corporation envisioned its non cash impairment charges between  1 4 billion and  1 8 billion for the fourth quarter  primarily due to surplus production and softened natural gas prices inducing asset write downs of some proved and unproved reserves  The company is America s largest natural gas producer with attractive acreage in the core of the Appalachian Basin 
EQT Corporation estimates its fourth quarter net sales volumes in the band of 370 375 billion cubic feet equivalent  Bcfe   indicating a movement toward the upper end of the earlier guided range of 355 375 Bcfe  The company is likely to have incurred capital expenses between  340 million and  360 million in the fourth quarter  lying within its previously provided estimate of  320  370 million   Read more  
5    Noble Energy   NASDAQ NBL   announced that Leviathan natural gas field has started commercial operation as expected   Its four wells and both subsea flowlines are currently fully operational  Natural gas produced from this field is currently supplied to Israel  Jordan and Egypt  The combined gross natural gas sales from the Leviathan and Tamar fields have averaged 1 5 billion cubic feet equivalent per day  Bcfe d  in January  with peak day sales reaching up to 1 7 Bcfe d 
This Leviathan field is located 80 miles offshore Israel in 5 500 feet of water  It is estimated to have recoverable resources of 22 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  of natural gas from 35 Tcf of in place resource  Noble Energy holds a 39 66  interest in the Leviathan project  and other interest owners include Delek Drilling LP with 45 34  stake and Ratio Oil Exploration LP with 15  
Noble Energy expects combined regional sales for Tamar and Leviathan to range between 1 6 Bcfe d and 1 8 Bcfe d for 2020  Natural gas produced from this field will assist Israel s gradual transition from polluting coal to natural gas as a fuel source and improve air quality in the region  Read more

3857,225372,APA,Oil   Gas US E P Outlook  Bullish Signals Abound,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of companies based in the United States focused on exploration and production  E P  of oil and natural gas  These firms are engaged in finding hydrocarbon reservoirs  drilling oil and gas wells  and producing and selling these materials to be refined later into products such as gasoline Some of the prominent stocks in this industry are Apache Corporation  NYSE APA   APA   Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation  NYSE COG   COG   Noble Energy Inc  NYSE NBL    NBL   Diamondback Energy  Inc   FANG  and Cimarex Energy Co  NYSE XEC    XEC  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes  Oil posted 34 5  rise last year   the biggest annual increase since 2016  In particular  WTI  the U S  benchmark  jumped nearly 11  in December  aided in part by the agreement on a phase one trade deal between the United States and China  The development   coming after months of wrangling   was seen to prop up the oil demand outlook on the back of revival in global economic growth  The recent  formal signing  of the agreement is set to further strengthen the oil consumption levels as Beijing has pledged to purchase a massive  50 billion in American energy products over the next two years  Also boosting oil  the OPEC  group is cutting output by as much as 500 000 barrels per day from Jan 1 for three months  Meanwhile  no major commodity had a worse 2019 than natural gas  The fuel endured a torrid year  registering its worst annual decline since 2014  Prices tumbled more than 25  last year  falling to multi year lows of around  2 1 per MMBtu in between  as buyers fled the market over growing worries about record output and concerns of an ongoing supply glut  With output from shale formations swamping the market  there is little room for prices to improve meaningfully from their current levels of around  2 2 per MMBtu  Operators in oil dominated shale basins like the Permian  Eagle Ford and North Dakota are also struggling with significant natural gas flaring   a largely unwanted derivative that emerges alongside crude production in the region  Over the past few years  energy producers worked tirelessly to cut costs to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable terms from the beleaguered service producers  Moreover  driven by operational efficiencies  most E P operators have been able to reduce unit costs and live within their cash flows  All of these factors  together with production growth and capital discipline have resulted in healthy free cash flows  With cash generation expected to remain robust even at relatively low oil prices  there is strong potential for greater return of capital to shareholders through dividend growth and stock buybacks  Zacks Industry Rank Paints a Rosy PicturesThe Zacks Oil and Gas   US E P is a 61 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  64  which places it in the top 25  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bullish near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Taking into consideration the positive near term prospects of the industry  we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas   US E P industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 27 2  over this period compared to the S P 500 s gain of 23 6  and broader sector s decrease of 5 6  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current Valuation  Since oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt  For capital intensive companies  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 8 43X  lower than the S P 500 s 12 12X  It is  however  well above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 5 06X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 17 27X  as low as 4 96X  with a median of 8 41X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio    Bottom LineThe trade deal should help prop up the demand outlook for oil while OPEC s deeper supply cuts are likely to push the market back into supply deficit  Moreover  the growth rate of U S  shale oil production is set to slacken substantially in 2020 on reduced capital availability  Finally  greater financial discipline practiced by the energy companies have raised expectations that supply growth could slow down sooner than later With the

3858,225373,APA,MTDR Vs  APA  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States stocks have likely encountered both Matador Resources  MTDR  and Apache  APA   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Matador Resources has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Apache has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MTDR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
MTDR currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 32  while APA has a forward P E of 628 88  We also note that MTDR has a PEG ratio of 1 71  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  APA currently has a PEG ratio of 104 81 
Another notable valuation metric for MTDR is its P B ratio of 1 03  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  APA has a P B of 1 60 
Based on these metrics and many more  MTDR holds a Value grade of B  while APA has a Value grade of C 
MTDR sticks out from APA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that MTDR is the better option right now ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mtdr-vs-apa-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200499332,200499332

3860,225375,APA,Yes  You Can Time The Market  Find Out How   January 17  2020,opinion,"There is no better feeling for an investor than trusting your gut or doing your research and timing the markets correctly  right 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Oils Energy stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  Apache Corporation  NYSE APA   Antero Resources Corporation  AR   Alliance Resource Partners  L P   ARLP   Abraxas Petroleum Corporation  AXAS   Azure Power Global Ltd   AZRE 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

191278,412794,APA,Apache Corp to close San Antonio office  cut 272 jobs,news," Reuters    U S  oil and gas producer  Apache Corp   NYSE APA  will close its San Antonio  Texas office overseeing its struggling Alpine High project in the Permian basin and 272 jobs will be affected 
The closure follows the October resignation of Steven Keenan  the former senior vice president of worldwide exploration who was widely credited with the Alpine High discovery in 2016 
Alpine High has been hit by weak natural gas prices  which prompted the company to temporarily halt production in the third quarter  reduce drilling in the region  and said it would reassign capital to other areas if prices did not recover 
Weak commodity prices have also forced other companies in the oil and gas industry to find ways to shore up their cash reserves amid heavy investor pressure to boost returns and reduce debt 
Reuters reported in October that oilfield services firm Halliburton  NYSE HAL  cut 650 jobs across Colorado  Wyoming  New Mexico and North Dakota and later in December closed plants in Oklahoma and California 
Including session s losses  Apache shares are still up about a quarter since Tuesday  when the company announced a major oil discovery in a closely watched area off the coast of Suriname  central to its plans to move away from Alpine High 
In a filing made with the Texas Workforce Commission  Apache Corp said the affected employees will be leaving the company on March 6 
Apache has reported a steady decline in output in the last two reported quarters of 2019 and undertook a reorganization last summer that is expected to lead to a 10  to 15  average reduction in global workforce 
Company spokesman Phil West said the decision to close the San Antonio office is part of the ongoing reorganization  which is expected to help save the company at least  150 million annually 
West added that some of the affected employees will move to other Apache offices  including Houston

191283,412799,APA,Exclusive  India readying  2 6 billion U S  naval helicopter deal ahead of Trump trip,news,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI  Reuters    India is set to give final approval to a  2 6 billion deal for military helicopters from U S  defense firm  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  ahead of a proposed visit by U S  President Donald Trump this month  defense and industry sources said 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government is trying to pull out all the stops for Trump s trip in a bid to reaffirm strategic ties between the two countries  which have been buffeted by sharp differences over trade  to counter China 
India s defense purchases from the United States have reached  17 billion since 2007 as it has pivoted away from traditional supplier Russia  looking to modernize its military and narrow the gap with China 
Modi s cabinet committee on security is expected to clear the purchase of 24 MH 60R Seahawk helicopters for the Indian navy in the next two weeks  a defense official and an industry source briefed on the matter separately told Reuters 
 It s a government to government deal  it is close   said the industry source 
To cut short lengthy negotiations between Lockheed and the Indian government  the helicopters that will be deployed on India s warships will be bought through the U S  foreign military sales route  under which the two governments will agree details of the deal 
Trump is expected in India around Feb 24 on his first official visit to the country  although no formal announcement has yet been made 
Both countries are separately working on a limited trade agreement ahead of the trip  after earlier imposing tit for tat tariffs on each other s imports 
Trump has called India the  tariff king of the world  but the Modi government has been trying to address some of his concerns 
Trade officials have pointed to large scale U S  arms purchases  from surveillance planes to Apache  NYSE APA  and Chinook helicopters  as proof of India s willingness to tighten strategic ties 
The multirole helicopters will be equipped with Hellfire missiles and are meant to help the Indian navy track submarines in the Indian Ocean  where China is expanding its presence 
Many of India s warships are without any helicopters because of years of underfunding  and the navy had sought their acquisition as a top priority 
The government outlined only a modest rise in its 2020 21 defense spending to  73 65 billion in the budget on Feb  1  of which a part will go toward making a down payment on the helicopter purchase  a defense official said 
 We expect a positive announcement soon on the helicopters   the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity because of service rules   There are limited resources  but there is an allocation  
The U S  State Department approved the sale of the choppers to India last year along with radars  torpedoes and 10 AGM 114 Hellfire missiles 
The clearance came after the Trump administration rolled out a new  Buy American  plan in 2018 that had relaxed restrictions on sales  saying it would bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home 
The United States has also offered India the armed version of Guardian drones that were originally authorized for sale as unarmed for surveillance purposes  the first such approval for a country outside the NATO alliance 
India plans to buy 30 of these unmanned aircraft for surveillance of the Indian Ocean  at a cost estimated to be about  2 5 billion  from General Atomics 
However  the defense official said the deal is unlikely immediately because of lack of funds ",2020-02-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive-india-readying-26-billion-us-naval-helicopter-deal-ahead-of-trump-trip-2080651,2080651

                                         it is worth noting that so far there has not been a significant move in the Dow    The first chart shows a big spike in oil when the news of retaliation by Iran hit     The first chart shows the volatility in oil near the highs when smart investors started to speculate that Iran did not want war as the retaliation was measured     The chart shows oil falling as latecomers figured out that Iran did not want war    The chart shows that oil took another leg down when there was no immediate U S  retaliation     The first chart shows that oil broke support on speculation that Trump will let this pass and de escalate the situation  In plain English  oil is lower as of this writing compared to where it was before Iranian retaliation    The probability is very high that Trump may choose to de escalate  but investors should not be complacent because Trump is unpredictable     The probability is very high that Iran will continue to de escalate  but investors should not be complacent because the Iran regime is clever  more attacks may come in different forms    The second chart is a 25 year look at the stock market  It is important to see how far the stock market has come  It is simply common sense to stay bullish but to have defensive measures in place to protect portfolios  At The Arora Report we provide precise cash levels and hedges to hold in addition to positions to hold and buy    Of importance on the second chart of the stock market is RSI  relative strength index  divergence  In plain English  it means that as the stock market has reached new highs  it is losing its internal momentum     Loss of internal momentum is significantly more important than it seems on the surface because this market is controlled by the momo  momentum  crowd  The momo crowd keeps on buying not because valuations are low or because the macro picture is getting much better or earnings are rising fast  but because the stock market is simply going up  Most analysts would not dare tell you this simple truth    The third chart is that of Apple stock  The Apple stock chart is extremely important because Apple carries a heavy weight in indexes and ETFs such as Nasdaq 100 ETF

191304,412820,APA,Why Apache Stock Is Skyrocketing Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Apache  NYSE APA  had surged more than 19  by 10 00 a m  EST on Tuesday  Fueling the energy stock was news that it had made a  significant  oil discovery offshore Suriname  
So what
Last month  Apache issued a disappointing operational update on the Maka Central 1 well offshore Suriname  While the company didn t state that it had drilled a dry hole  it planned to continue drilling deeper and conduct more tests  which led investors to believe that it hadn t found commercial hydrocarbons  

However  Apache and its partner  French oil giant Total  NYSE TOT   announced today that they could confirm a significant oil discovery at the Maka Central 1 well  After conducting additional tests  the partners encountered a 240 foot thick oil reservoir as well as a 164 foot column of light oil and gas condensate 
Apache CEO John Christmann commented on the find by saying the company is  very pleased with the result from Maka Central 1   He noted that the  well proves a working hydrocarbon system   which  indicates the potential for prolific oil wells   Because of that  Apache and Total believe they have significant resource potential beyond the Maka Central discovery since they control 1 4 million acres in the region   
Now what
Apache has disappointed investors in recent years  as its Alpine High play in the Permian Basin hasn t panned out as well as it expected  Investors initially feared the same with offshore Suriname  Instead  it now appears as if the company has a major oil discovery on its hands  That could be a big time growth driver in the coming years as Apache works with Total to develop Maka Central and other future potential finds in the area ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pey5s,2054130

 Embassy s perimeter and hurled rocks in two days of protests withdrew on Wednesday after Washington dispatched extra troops and threatened reprisals against Tehran  The demonstrators  angry at U S  air strikes against the Tehran backed Kataib Hezbollah group in which at least 25 people were killed  threw stones at the building while U S  forces stationed on the rooftops fired tear gas to disperse them  By mid afternoon  most appeared to have obeyed a call to withdraw  issued by the Popular Mobilization Forces  PMF  umbrella group of mainly Shi ite militia  which said the demonstrators  message had been heard  Young men used palm tree branches to sweep the street in front of the embassy compound  Others packed up equipment and vans arrived to take people away  Some left to set up a protest camp in front of a nearby hotel  Iraq s military said all protesters had left by the evening  The protests marked a new turn in the shadow war between Washington and Tehran playing out across the Middle East   U S  President Donald Trump  who faces a re election campaign in 2020  accused Iran of orchestrating the violence  He threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war   Iran  under severe economic duress from punishing U S  sanctions put in place by Trump  denied responsibility  The unrest followed U S  air raids on Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah bases in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U S  contractor in northern Iraq last week   On Tuesday  crowds chanted   Death to America    lit fires  and smashed surveillance cameras  They breached an outer perimeter of the embassy but did not enter the main compound  BIGGEST U S  EMBASSY The huge embassy  built along the banks of the Tigris River in central Baghdad s fortified  green zone  during the American occupation following the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein  is the biggest U S  diplomatic mission in the world  Washington said its diplomats were safe and it was rushing hundreds of extra troops to the region  The State Department said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided to postpone his upcoming trip to Ukraine  Belarus  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and Cyprus to remain in Washington and monitor the situation in Iraq   L1N29606E  Pompeo spoke on Wednesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi  Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim

to keep U S  personnel secure and would move the Iran backed attackers away from  USEmbBaghdad   Pompeo wrote on Twitter he thanked the emir in the call  for Qatar s solidarity in the face of Iran s malign regional influence   including the attack on the embassy in Baghdad  The embassy said all public consular operations were suspended and all future appointments canceled  The anti American action came after months of protests in Iraq against the government and the Iran backed militias that support it  Many Iraqis complain their country has become a battlefield for a proxy war for influence between Washington and Tehran  and that their leaders are too beholden to outside powers  Iraq s government has long faced frictions in its close relations with the two foes  Trump spoke to Abdul Mahdi on Tuesday and demanded Iraq protect the embassy  Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned the U S  attacks  Iran summoned a Swiss envoy  who represents U S  interests in Tehran  to complain about what it described as  warmongering  words from Washington  U S  officials said 750 extra troops would initially be based out of Kuwait and as many as 4 000 troops could be sent to the region in coming days  More than 5 000 U S  troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces  The air strikes have galvanized calls inside Iraq to expel them  Many in

forces found themselves on the same side during Iraq s 2014 2017 war against Islamic State fighters  with both powers helping the government recapture territory from militants who had overrun a third

anti government protests in which more than 450 people were killed  is backed by Iran and its allies  The militia may have decided to pull back from the embassy to avoid making him look weak or to avert clashes with government forces  Overnight  demonstrators pitched tents and camped outside the embassy walls  then brought food  cooking equipment and mattresses during the morning  indicating plans to stay before the withdrawal call

Shares of Apache  NYSE APA  climbed 14 9  in December  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  rebounding from a nearly two decade low after the company announced a promising new joint venture 
To be clear  it wasn t all sunshine and rainbows last month for the oil stock last month  Apache plummeted more than 12  to an 18 year low on Dec  2  after the company announced a discouraging operational update for its Maka Central 1 Well offshore Suriname 

So what
However  Apache stock quickly recovered from that pullback over the next few weeks  Then shares soared more than 17  on Dec  23 alone  after the company announced a new 50 50 joint venture with France based Total SA  NYSE TOT  to explore and develop  Block 58  offshore Suriname    a 1 4 million acre area in water depths ranging from under 100 meters to over 2 100 meters  
Under the terms of the joint venture  Apache says it will operate the first three exploration wells in Block 58  including the aforementioned Maka Central 1 well  before subsequently transferring ownership to Total  Apache will also receive  5 billion of cash carry on its first  7 5 billion of appraisal and development capital  25  cash carry after that first  7 5 billion  reimbursement of half of all costs incurred to date in the block  and  various cash payments  tied to the closing of the joint venture and future production 
Now what
Apache CEO John Christmann called Block 58  a unique  large scale oil resource opportunity   adding   Total s extensive offshore operational experience and global footprint make it an ideal partner for a block of this size and potential  
Assuming Apache and Total meet required drilling commitments for the project  they ll maintain the rights to explore Block 58 through the middle of 2026 
In addition  Apache elaborated in the joint venture press release that  deepening and testing operations continue  at the Maka Central 1 well  and that they re  encouraged by the preliminary information and test results  so far 
In the end  this positive news was exactly what beaten down Apache shareholders needed to hear last month  and the stock responded in kind ",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pditz,2052385

191337,412853,APA,WikiLeaks founder Assange appears confused at extradition hearing,news,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON  Reuters    WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared confused at a London court hearing on Monday  struggling to recall his name and age in his first public appearance in months as he sought to fight his extradition to the United States 
Assange  48  who spent seven years holed up in Ecuador s embassy before he was dragged out in April  faces 18 counts in the United States including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law  He could spend decades in prison if convicted 
On Monday he appeared clean shaven  without the long beard he had worn at his last public appearance in May  when he was sentenced to 50 weeks jail for skipping bail  He appeared in good health  with his white hair combed back and wearing a navy suit over a light blue sweater and white shirt 
But he mumbled and stuttered for several seconds as he gave his name and date of birth at the start of a preliminary hearing in the case 
When the judge asked him at the end of the hearing if he knew what was happening  he replied  not exactly   complained about the conditions in jail  and said he was unable to  think properly  
 I don t understand how this is equitable   he said   I can t research anything  I can t access any of my writing  It s very difficult where I am  
Assange is being held in British jail pending the U S  extradition  having served his sentence for skipping bail 
He fled to the embassy in 2012 to avoid being sent to Sweden to face sex crimes accusations  He says the U S  charges against him are a political attempt to silence journalists and publishers  and the Swedish allegations were part of a plot to catch him  Sweden is reviewing the sex crimes cases 
The former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone was among Assange s supporters in the public gallery  while protesters gathered outside court 
Assange s lawyer Mark Summers argued that Assange s extradition hearing  scheduled for February 2020  should be delayed by three months due to the complexity of the case 
 The evidence in this case would test the limits of most lawyers   Summers told the court  He cited the difficulty of communicating with Assange who he said doesn t have a computer in prison  The judge denied the request to delay the hearing 
Australian born Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U S  military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people  including two Reuters news staff 
WikiLeaks later angered the United States by publishing caches of leaked military documents and diplomatic cables 
Admirers have hailed Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech  As he entered the dock  people in the public gallery raised their fists in solidarity with him 
His detractors have painted him as a dangerous figure complicit in Russian efforts to undermine the West ",2019-10-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/wikileaks-founder-assange-appears-confused-at-extradition-hearing-2000315,2000315

191339,412855,APA,Shale Doubters Finally Get Their Moment as Revolution Falters,news," Bloomberg     It was just a year ago that Tom Loughrey tried pitching a fund to bet against shale producers 
 I was basically kicked out of every office in New York City   Loughrey said 
In the months since  an exchange traded fund that tracks oil drillers has lost half its value  shale production growth has slowed  funding has gotten scarce and more than two dozen companies have collapsed into bankruptcy 
Things have changed for Loughrey  too  The 43 year old former hedge fund manager no longer looks to invest the money himself  He ditched the fund and teamed with  Michael Friezo  an ex Credit Suisse Group investment banker who once gave him a job  They formed Chapel Hill  North Carolina based Friezo Loughrey Oil Well Partners LLC  or FLOW  to advise others 
Loughrey s sweet spot is the gap between expectation and reality when it comes to drillers  projections of what their wells will actually produce  He uses data number crunched from state records and applies assumptions he says are more realistic than those offered by companies in investor presentations 
As the shale boom decelerates  other data shops are selling similar services  They include  Enverus  formerly known as Drillinginfo Inc    RS Energy and  Rystad Energy 
 Rosy View 
 Independent  unbiased analysis can shed a light of truth on management projections   said Nick Volkmer  RS Energy s vice president of intelligence   It s well known that management teams are often compensated for production and reserves growth  incentivizing optimism and a rosy view of the future  
Read more  How U S  Oil Output Went From Explosive to Sluggish
One of Loughrey s favorite targets is  Apache Corp   NYSE APA   and its flagship Alpine High oil discovery in West Texas 
Others have criticized Apache s little drilled corner of the Permian Basin because it promises more liquids rich gas than the preferred  more expensive oil 
Apache touts a typical well there that would ultimately recover a stew of hydrocarbons that s  at most  15  oil 
Loughrey  however  says that in some places  Apache s projections are about 80  too high 
 I think there should be a brouhaha about this   Loughrey said 
Apache said it hasn t reviewed Loughrey s methodology and his work may include  exploratory wells  and  concept tests  that aren t meant to optimize the company s projections  The number Apache used in its most recent Alpine High presentation was initially published in October 2017  before the company had fracked any multi well development pads  spokesman Phil West said in an email 
After drilling  a handful of large  multi well  multi zone pads at Alpine High   the company is evaluating the play s performance  West said  In the meantime  Apache suspended some activity there in response to low commodity prices 
Investors have largely written off Alpine High since Apache announced it three years ago  The company s stock is down more than 60   and a pipeline entity that serves the patch has lost three quarters of its market value since it was spun off from Apache last year  The geologist credited with the Alpine High resigned last week  sending shares and bonds plummeting 
There s More
Loughrey warns there are other companies that face a reckoning once their reserve estimates fail to pan out 
 Shale wells make money   Loughrey said   It s a question of if the stocks will make you money  
Data analysts working the shale patch can thank a quirk in federal oversight for their ability to build businesses based on providing investors with outside data 
The  Securities and Exchange Commission sets strict criteria for what holdings oil companies can report as  proved reserves   But forecasts pitched in press releases and investor presentations aren t subject to the same restraints  Instead  explorers like to publicize so called EURs  or estimated ultimate recoveries 
 That s basically a petroleum engineering term that means that  with all the data  what the well will ultimately recover   said  Dean Rietz  chief executive officer of reservoir engineering firm Ryder Scott Co   But none of it may be reserves  
Instead  those projections include  contingent resources  that can t be profitably pumped under current conditions 
Optimistic expectations are compounded by assumptions about how close wells can be drilled to one another  Newer wells  called  child wells   can sometimes  interfere with output from the  parent well   diminishing profits  But the risk of drilling them too far apart means leaving crude underground 
Diminished Output
It s a problem that s worried even some of the industry s bigger players   Concho Resources  NYSE CXO  Inc  revised down its production goals for the year after it drilled 23 wells too close together  Earlier this year   Diamondback Energy Inc  CEO  Travis Stice said producers should do a better job of representing the problem of diminished output due to parent and child wells in their forecasts 
Counting on companies to alter the way they pitch growth is probably a  lost cause   said Kevin Kaiser  a consultant who successfully bet against some of the biggest names in the pipeline industry 
The warning that drillers routinely cram single spaced on the first slide of a company presentation to investors is considered by the SEC sufficient enough that the next hour of line graphs and bullet points is essentially wishful thinking 
Allowing producers to advertise oil and gas reserves that aren t proved is meant  to enable companies to provide investors with more insight   the SEC said in 2008 
Companies are required by law to report well results to state regulators  but often that data is difficult to find and hard to aggregate  As Loughrey puts it   It s like a bunch of dusty old phone books  
That gives Loughrey an edge when it comes to analyzing oil producers 
 They re losing money every year   Loughrey said   There s something wrong with this  ",2019-10-28,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/shale-doubters-finally-get-their-moment-as-revolution-falters-2005664,2005664

Russia to harm his election opponent Hillary Clinton  told reporters he had no opinion on the charges against Assange   I know nothing about WikiLeaks  It s not my thing   Trump said   Assange gave a thumbs up in handcuffs as he was taken from a police station to a London court  where he pronounced himself not guilty of failing to surrender in 2012  Judge Michael Snow called Assange  wearing a black jacket and black shirt  a  narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interests  and convicted him of skipping bail  Sentencing will be at a later date  Police said they arrested Assange  47  after being invited into the embassy following Ecuador s withdrawal of asylum  He took refuge there in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault investigation that was later dropped  Assange was carried out of the building   located behind the luxury department store Harrods   carrying a copy of Gore Vidal s  History of The National Security State   which he continued reading in court  In Washington  the U S  Justice Department said Assange was charged with conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of a 2010 leak by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of U S  military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and American diplomatic communications  Legal experts said more U S  charges could be coming  The indictment was made secretly in March 2018 and unsealed on Thursday  He faces up to five years in prison if convicted  with legal experts saying more charges were possible  Ecuador suspended Julian Assange s citizenship and accused him and others at WikiLeaks of collaborating in attempts to destabilize the Andean nation s government  FRICTION WITH ECUADOR Assange was offered refuge in 2012 by Ecuador s then president Rafael Correa  but his relationship with Ecuador soured under Correa s successor Lenin Moreno  who has said Assange violated the terms of his asylum  Ecuador accused Assange of leaking information about Moreno s personal life  Lawyers for Assange said he may risk torture and his life would be in danger if he were to be extradited to the United States  The arrest  after years holed up in a few cramped rooms at the embassy  represented one of the most sensational turns in a tumultuous life that has transformed the computer programmer into a fugitive wanted by the United States   The whole House will welcome the news this morning that the Metropolitan Police have arrested Julian Assange  arrested for breach of bail after nearly seven years in the Ecuadorean embassy   May said  Ecuador s foreign minister said his country was not aware of any active extradition requests for Assange before it terminated his asylum  Supporters of Assange said Ecuador had betrayed him at the behest of Washington  illegally ended his asylum and engineered a dark moment for press freedom   Journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges   Barry Pollack  a lawyer for Assange  said in a statement reacting to the U S  indictment  His admirers have hailed Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech  His detractors have painted him as a dangerous figure complicit in Russian efforts to undermine the West and U S  security  and dispute that he is a journalist   Under the guise of transparency  Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have effectively acted as an arm of the Russian intelligence services for years   U S  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr  a Republican  said   Hopefully  he will now face justice   The Kremlin said it hoped Assange s rights would not be violated  WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U S  diplomatic cables that laid bare critical U S  appraisals of world leaders  from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family  Assange made international headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U S  military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people  including two Reuters news staff  U S  INVESTIGATION Assange s U S  indictment arose from a long running criminal investigation dating back to the administration of former President Barack Obama  It was triggered in part by WikiLeaks  publication in 2010 of U S  military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the diplomatic communications   disclosures that embarrassed the United States and strained relations with allies  The Justice Department said Assange was arrested under an extradition treaty between the United States and Britain  The indictment said Assange in March 2010 engaged in a conspiracy to assist Manning  formerly named Bradley Manning  in cracking a password stored on U S  Department of Defense computers connected to a U S  government network used for classified documents and communications  Manning s lawyers demanded the release of the former intelligence analyst  jailed last month after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury  and said  continued detention would be purely punitive   A Swedish lawyer representing the alleged rape victim said she would push to have prosecutors reopen the case  but a retired senior prosecutor and chairman of NGO Victim Support Sweden said that may be difficult  Britain said no person was above the law   Julian Assange is no hero  he has hidden from the truth for years and years   British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said   It s not so much Julian Assange being held hostage in the Ecuadorean embassy  it s actually Julian Assange holding the Ecuadorean embassy hostage in a situation that was absolutely intolerable for them   Friends of Assange said his solitary existence in the embassy was tough on him   It was a miserable existence and I could see it was a strain on him  but a strain he managed rather well   said Vaughan Smith  a friend who had visited Assange   The thing that was most difficult for Julian was the solitude    He was very tough  but the last year in particular was very difficult  He was constantly being surveilled and spied upon  There was no privacy for him   Smith said  Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006  The website published secret official information  infuriating the United States and other countries  WikiLeaks said Ecuador had illegally terminated his political asylum in violation of international law

191390,412906,APA,Explainer   Looking for America  Is Julian Assange heading to the United States ,news,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Michael Holden LONDON  Reuters    British police dragged Julian Assange from the Ecuadorean embassy last Thursday after his asylum was revoked  ending his seven year stay there and opening the way for his extradition to the United States  Assange s supporters  who cast him as a dissident facing the wrath of a superpower  fear the 47 year old will end up on trial in the United States  The United States wants Assange for one of the largest compromises of classified information in U S  history  What happens now  WHO IS ASSANGE  Assange was born on July 3  1971 in Australia  In his teens  he gained a reputation as a talented computer programmer and in the mid 1990s he was arrested and pleaded guilty to hacking  He founded WikiLeaks in 2006   He shot to fame in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U S  military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people  including two Reuters news staff  WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of secret U S  diplomatic cables that laid bare often critical U S  appraisals of world leaders  from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family  WHY WAS HE IN THE ECUADOREAN EMBASSY  Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in June 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden  where authorities wanted to question him as part of a preliminary sexual assault investigation   That investigation was later dropped but because he had breached his British bail in 2012  he was arrested last week and found guilty of failing to surrender to Westminster Magistrates  Court  Following his arrest  U S  prosecutors announced charges against him and Swedish prosecutors are considering reopening the rape investigation   JAIL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM  Westminster Magistrates  Court s Judge Michael Snow said Assange faces up to 12 months in jail when he is sentenced at a later date at Southwark Crown Court  The British criminal action against Assange will take precedence over extradition proceedings although Nick Vamos  lawyer at London based firm Peters   Peters and former head of extradition at Britain s Crown Prosecution Service  said in practice it would make little difference       Even if he gets a maximum 12 month sentence  that means he will serve six and it will take at least six months for his extradition proceedings to be resolved   Vamos told Reuters      So while he is in custody  the extradition hearings can proceed  The British judge gave the U S  government a deadline of June 12 to outline its case against Assange  SO DOES ASSANGE END UP IN SWEDEN OR THE UNITED STATES  The courts will have to rule on any extradition request and Home Secretary Sajid Javid would decide which one takes precedence  Vamos said the home secretary would take into account the seriousness of the offence and which request was issued first  and expected a Swedish one would take supremacy        Even though technically it would be a re issued request  in effect it would be just a repeat of the request that was issued many years ago and therefore it would be treated as if it was the earliest one   he said       The fact that his extradition had already been ordered on it once would be in the home secretary s mind  The U S  government can wait a bit longer  they ve taken quite a long time to sort out whether they were ever going to charge him or not      We don t know what happened in Sweden  we don t whether he committed that offense and there s a victim there who s been waiting for justice for many years and I think that should take priority   WHAT IS THE U S  CASE  Just hours after Assange s arrest  U S  prosecutors announced charges against him for conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer  The indictment  filed in March 2018 and unsealed on Thursday  said Assange in March 2010 engaged in a conspiracy to help Manning crack a password stored on Defense Department computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network  SIPRNet   a U S  government network used for classified documents and communications  Manning  formerly Bradley Manning  was jailed on March 8 after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury in what is widely believed to be related to the Assange investigation  Manning was convicted by court martial in 2013 of espionage and other offences for furnishing more than 700 000 documents  videos  diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks while she was an intelligence analyst in Iraq  Former President Barack Obama commuted the final 28 years of Manning s 35 year sentence  WHAT IS THE SWEDISH INVESTIGATION  Assange was accused by two Swedish women of sexual assault and rape in 2010  After opening an initial investigation  prosecutors dropped it  only to reopen it and issue an European arrest order for Assange  who had left the country for Britain  Assange  who denied the allegations  fought through the courts to get an extradition order and the preliminary investigation dropped   His lawyers said he feared that should he go to Sweden  authorities could hand him over to the United States  Prosecutors ended the preliminary investigation into allegations of sexual molestation and unlawful coercion in 2015 as the statute of limitations had already passed  but kept open the rape probe  In May 2017  then chief prosecutor Marianne Ny dropped the preliminary investigation into rape without filing any charges  saying that there was no prospect of Assange being handed over within a reasonable timeframe  Swedish prosecutors said on April 11 they had received a formal request to reopen the rape investigation from the legal counsel representing the alleged victim   The request was assigned to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva Marie Persson  who said prosecutors would look into the matter and determine how to proceed   The statute of limitation for rape is 10 years  a deadline which would be reached in the mid August next year  HOW COULD ASSANGE FIGHT EXTRADITION       Everybody can challenge an extradition request on the basis it would be contrary to their human rights for them to be extradited   Vamos said        So Assange could argue that it would be impossible for him to have a fair trial in the U S  given what happened to Chelsea Manning  given the notoriety  the publicity about his case that effectively he s been tried in the media  public statements by U S  officials  that  it s impossible for him to have a fair trial       He could also bring up potential conditions he would face in U S  prisons       He could argue the entire request is politically motivated that he is being prosecuted by reason of his political opinions or his political affiliations  that it s revenge  it s vindictive  it s a vendetta   Vamos said   All of those arguments have legs         Sweden s original request for Assange s extradition went to Britain s Supreme Court which backed the request      If a lower court orders his extradition  then he could again appeal the decision to London s High Court and ultimately again to the Supreme Court if he can identify a challenge based on a point of law  
    For U S  requests  the courts  decision has to be ratified by the Home Secretary but Vamos said in effect this was now just a rubber stamping exercise ",2019-04-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/explainer--looking-for-america-is-julian-assange-heading-to-the-united-states-1836238,1836238

191429,412945,APA,BHP Shows Patience Pays in  10 5 Billion BP Deal,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Even the most sorry tale can have something like a happy ending 
That looks to be the case with BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd  s misbegotten foray into onshore U S  oil and gas  With the announcement Friday that the company will sell its assets in the Eagle Ford  Permian and Haynesville basins to  BP   LON BP  Plc for  10 5 billion  the company s U S  oil unit will be sticking to the deep seas 
The price looks better than many had been expecting  At the time Elliott Management Corp  started pushing for a divestment of the assets in April last year  brokers valued them at an average of  6 5 billion  First round bids for the business from BP   Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc had come in between  7 billion and  9 billion  people familiar with the matter told Kiel Porter and Dinesh Nair of Bloomberg News last month 
By BHP s own numbers  net operating assets in the three basins were worth about  9 5 billion at the end of December   although the gross value was pegged Friday at  10 9 billion  or  13 9 billion including goodwill 
Of course  things have changed over the past 15 months  The Permian is currently the hottest oil patch on the planet  with output up by almost half since last April to 3 5 million barrels a day   about a third of the total output from Saudi Arabia or Russia  and considerably more than the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait   and the number of rigs exploring for more rising by about 40 percent 
Even so  those numbers have yet to translate into more earnings  or even significantly higher valuations  The median Ebitda multiple of Permian exposed U S  oil producers fell to 7 1 last week from 7 9 six months ago  according to a Bloomberg compiled market weighted basket of 15 companies  That reflects pipeline constraints that have kept Permian production locked up onshore and trading at a sharp discount to benchmark West Texas Intermediate at Cushing  Oklahoma 
The cap on output is reflected in the financial numbers  too  The businesses BP is buying haven t turned a profit in years  and still lost  356 million in underlying Ebit in the six months through December  Excluding depreciation and amortization those numbers look better   but depreciation is a real cost for fast depleting shale plays  and can t be wiped out by accounting trickery if you buy an asset close to book value 
The advantages to BP are longer term  The company skulked away from the Permian by selling its assets to  Apache Corp   NYSE APA   in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010  With pipeline capacity from the region set to improve next year and in 2020  there s a decent chance too that the current mismatch between production strength and valuation weakness will close  In terms of acreage  that s already happening  The price is a discount to the  12 5 billion that UBS AG estimates the assets are worth  based on the value of recent transactions 
BHP s foray into the U S  onshore shale market was a disaster that opened up a  20 billion hole of writedowns  losses and wasted capital spending  Remaining disgruntlement with that outcome will be considerably muted by the promise from Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie to return the proceeds of the sale rather than reinvest them  Whether that s enough to placate Elliott remains to be seen ",2018-07-26,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bhp-shows-patience-pays-in-105-billion-bp-deal-1548201,1548201

191456,412972,APA,Trump says summit with North Korea s Kim  better than anybody expected ,news,"By Soyoung Kim  Steve Holland and Jack Kim
SINGAPORE  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump said a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday had gone  better than anybody could have expected   and they would sign a document following talks on ways to end a nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula 
Kim stood silently alongside Trump as he spoke to media during a post lunch stroll through the gardens of the Singapore hotel where the summit was held  but the North Korean leader had earlier described their meeting as a  a good prelude to peace  
Both men walked to Trump s limousine and looked in at the rear seat  with Trump apparently showing Kim something inside  They then resumed their walk 
 A lot of progress   really very positive  I think better than anybody could have expected  Top of the line  very good  We re going now for a signing   Trump told journalists  without giving details on what would be signed 
Should they succeed in making a diplomatic breakthrough  it could bring lasting change to the security landscape of Northeast Asia  like the visit of former U S  President Richard Nixon to China in 1972 led to the transformation of China 
Both men had looked serious as they got out of their limousines for the summit at the Capella hotel on Singapore s Sentosa  a resort island with luxury hotels  a casino  manmade beaches and a Universal Studios theme park 
But  with cameras of the world s press trained on them  they displayed an initial atmosphere of bonhomie as they met on the verandah of the Capella  a refurbished 19th century British regimental officers  mess 
After a handshake  they were soon smiling and holding each other by the arm  before Trump guided Kim to the library where they held a meeting with only their interpreters  Trump had said on Saturday he would know within a minute of meeting Kim whether he would reach a deal 
Inside  they sat alongside each other against a backdrop of North Korean and U S  flags  with Kim beaming broadly as the U S  president gave him a thumbs up 
The combatants of the 1950 53 Korean War are technically still at war  as the conflict  in which millions of people died  was concluded only with a truce 
After initial exchanges lasting around 40 minutes  Trump and Kim emerged  walking side by side through the colonnaded hotel before entering a meeting room  where they were joined by their most senior officials 
Kim was heard telling Trump through a translator   I think the entire world is watching this moment  Many people in the world will think of this as a scene from a fantasy   science fiction movie  
Asked by a reporter how the meeting was going  Trump said   Very good  Very  very good  Good relationship  
Kim also sounded positive about the prospects 
 We overcame all kinds of scepticism and speculations about this summit and I believe that this is good for the peace   he said   I believe this is a good prelude for peace  
Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  National Security Adviser John Bolton  and John Kelly  White House Chief of Staff  for the expanded talks  while Kim s team included former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol  foreign minister Ri Yong Ho and Ri Su Yong  vice chairman of the ruling Workers  Party 
MARKETS CALM
As the two leaders met  Singapore navy vessels  and air force Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters patrolled  while fighter jets and an Gulfstream 550 early warning aircraft circled 
Financial markets were largely steady in Asia and did not show any noticeable reaction to the start of the summit  The dollar was at a three week high and the MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares was largely unchanged from Monday 
While Trump and Kim search each other s eyes and words for signs of trust or deceit  the rest of the world will be watching  hoping that somehow these two unpredictable leaders can find a way to defuse one of the planet s most dangerous flashpoints 
Body language expert said both men tried to project command as they met  but also displayed signs of nerves 
After the meetings  the two teams and other senior officials met for a working lunch  where beef short ribs  sweet and sour pork and  Daegu Jormin   or Korean braised cod  were served for the main course  according to the menu  That was to be followed by dark chocolate tarts  pastries and vanilla ice cream for dessert  The North Korean leader s sister and close confidante Kim Yo Jong was among the lunch party 
As the cameras captured the moment  Trump quipped   Very nice  Getting a good picture everyone  so we all look nice and handsome and thin   perfect  
In the hours before the summit began  Trump expressed optimism about prospects for the first ever meeting of sitting U S  and North Korean leaders  while Pompeo injected a note of caution whether Kim would prove to be sincere about his willingness to denuclearize 
Pompeo said the summit should set the framework for  the hard work that will follow   insisting that North Korea had to move toward complete  verifiable and irreversible denuclearization 
North Korea  however  has shown little appetite for surrendering nuclear weapons it considers vital to the survival of Kim s dynastic rule 
Sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until that happened  Pompeo said on Monday   If diplomacy does not move in the right direction     those measures will increase  
The White House said later that discussions with North Korea had moved  more quickly than expected  and Trump would leave Singapore on Tuesday night after the summit  rather than Wednesday  as scheduled earlier 
Kim is due to leave on Tuesday afternoon  a source involved in the planning of his visit has said 
One of the world s most reclusive leaders  Kim visited Singapore s waterfront on Monday  smiling and waving to onlookers  adding to a more affable image that has emerged since his April summit with South Korean leader Moon Jae in 
Trump spoke to Moon and Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  both key allies of Washington in the region  to discuss developments ahead of the summit 
 I too  got little sleep last night   Moon told his cabinet in Seoul as the summit began in Singapore 
 I truly hope it will be a successful summit that will open a new age for the two Koreas and the United States and bring us complete denuclearization and peace  ",2018-06-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-optimistic-on-north-korea-summit-despite-differences-on-ending-nuclear-standoff-1488832,1488832
191457,412973,APA,U S  shale firms miss out on  70 oil after hedging at  55,news,"By Ayenat Mersie and David Gaffen NEW YORK  Reuters    Many top U S  shale oil producers are missing out on the rally in oil prices to more than  70 a barrel   because they sold their oil through futures contracts at about  55 last year when that looked like a good deal  Now  it looks cheap  Those hedged bets will hold down revenues and further frustrate Wall Street investors  who have been disappointed by slow returns from the booming Permian Basin in west Texas  The top 25 shale producers will forego about  1 7 billion in combined revenues in the second quarter with oil prices at about  70  according to Denver based consultancy PetroNerds  Many of those producers used hedges that guaranteed them between  55 and  58 a barrel  Some west Texas producers face a second profit limiting dynamic  They are forced to cut prices because the region s production is overwhelming its pipeline network  raising transportation costs  West Texas oil currently trades at a discount of  9 to U S  benchmark futures  a spread that hit  12 earlier in the month  Some firms earlier protected themselves from the widening gap with hedges against the discount   But those that didn t   and also hedged against future prices at  for instance  at  55   have been forced to sell barrels at prices in the low to mid  40s  Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   the biggest oil producer in the Permian  hedged using west Texas crude futures priced at about  59 a barrel  according to first quarter regulatory filings  The company did not hedge against the Midland differential   Occidential  which produces about 226 000 barrels per day  bpd  from the Permian  declined to comment on its hedging strategy  It could offset softer drilling revenues with better results from its pipeline unit  which benefits from the rising transportation costs  LOST UPSIDE Many firms sold their future output at prices in the  50s last year  hoping to take advantage of short term rallies to lock in guaranteed income to cover drilling and production costs  Those costs can be  30 a barrel or less in west Texas  allowing the firms a healthy profit even as they protected themselves against future price slumps   But the cost of that protection is to forego the potential upside of higher prices   The second problem  with pipeline capacity  stems from surprisingly quick production growth that has pushed pipeline capacity to the limit several months before producers expected  said Michael Tran  global energy strategist at RBC Capital Markets   Producers in west Texas  the nation s largest oilfield  are now pumping more than 3 3 million bpd  compared with 2 4 million bpd a year ago  With storage brimming and pipelines full  producers have had to offer steep discounts to compensate for rising transport costs   The large gap between the U S  futures price and Permian Basin oil is called the Midland differential   named for the town at the center of the west Texas oilfield boom  Until recently  firms had not hedged the discount because the price of Midland oil and U S  futures have historically tracked closely together  The market for such hedging is also less active  compared with futures hedging   But at the end of the first quarter  14 shale companies had hedged against 100 million barrels of 2019 s production in West Texas  compared with just 40 million barrels at the end of the fourth quarter  according to a Reuters analysis of U S  regulatory filings   It s really becoming a more widely used phenomenon   said Ben Montalbano  PetroNerds co founder  who said Midland hedging volume has increased tenfold in the last two years   Coming into this year   Cimarex Energy  Co  NYSE XEC  had hedged about 905 000 barrels of 2019 west Texas production at a 47 cent discount to U S  benchmark futures  That means if U S  oil futures trade at  70 a barrel  Cimarex would sell oil at  69 53   as opposed to companies that didn t hedge  and are exposed to the entire Midland discount  now at  9  In the first quarter  Cimarex increased its hedge against the differential to 3 1 million barrels  according to the firm s filings  About half of that  however  was hedged at a less favorable discount of  4 83 per barrel   effectively selling oil at  65 if futures are at  70  Cimarex produced about 50 000 bpd in the Permian in the first quarter  The company did respond to a request for comment  PIPELINE PROBLEMS With major pipelines not expected to come online until next year and production increasing  analysts expect the Midland differential to remain high  Occidental  in a recent presentation  said it expects this gap to hit  20 a barrel by the third quarter    For the first time in three years  we have not had a pipeline to come on to alleviate the bottleneck   said Tran  Some firms  including  Apache Corp   NYSE APA  and Pioneer Natural Resources  said they don t have to worry about the differential because they have reserved enough space on pipelines to transport their oil  Apache said it has started to hedge its Midland exposure for 2019  Pioneer does not have any such positions  said Rich Dealt  CFO  
 Pioneer has firm transportation in place over the next few years to move nearly all of its Permian Basin oil production to the Gulf Coast for export or sale to refineries   Dealt said ",2018-06-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-shale-firms-miss-out-on-70-oil-after-hedging-at-55-1491183,1491183

most urgent humanitarian crisis  The Western backed Arab alliance launched an onslaught on Hodeidah six days ago in order to turn the tables in a long  stalemated proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran that has compounded instability across the Middle East  The coalition intervened in Yemen s war in 2015 after Houthi rebels drove the internationally recognized government into exile  United Arab

191472,412988,APA,Return to Ward 17  Making peace with lost comrades,news,By Dean Yates MELBOURNE  Australia  Reuters    As the start of the memorial service neared  I hurriedly texted an Indonesian friend   Is it OK for me to stand on a Muslim prayer mat   I asked  I d spent 10 days preparing for this ritual  It was really 10 years  I wanted to get everything right  I was about to ask Reuters photographer Namir Noor Eldeen and driver Saeed Chmagh  both Iraqis  to forgive me for what I saw as my complicity in their deaths  I was the Iraq bureau chief for Reuters when Namir  22  and Saeed  40  were shot dead by a U S  Apache  NYSE APA  helicopter on the streets of Baghdad on July 12  2007  along with 10 other people  The attack grabbed global attention when WikiLeaks released classified U S  military footage of the incident in 2010  The video  titled  Collateral Murder   was viewed millions of times  I had planned to be in Iraq for the 10th anniversary  to apologize to Namir and Saeed s families  Instead  unable to cope as the day approached  I was admitted to the Psychological Trauma Recovery Services inpatient unit at Melbourne s Austin Health  It was my second admission to the facility  known as Ward 17  in less than a year  Hoping more psychotherapy would help  I connected instead with a chaplain in training with streaks of white color through her brown hair  This former fashion designer never questioned my guilt and shame  She helped me plan the memorial service and stood by my side at Austin Health s chapel when I read aloud a hand written  4 885 word letter to Namir and Saeed  I also sought advice from a towering Egyptian born imam at a nearby mosque  I attended Friday prayers  Together  they helped me heal  They helped me forgive myself  During my first hospitalization in Ward 17 in 2016  I learned how I d developed post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  from years of covering war  terrorist attacks and natural disasters in the Middle East and Southeast Asia for Reuters  I was taught strategies to deal with the many symptoms I had such as anger  anxiety  emotional numbness and an inability to deal with unexpected noise  I read everything I could find on PTSD  trauma and war  But I did not make peace with the event that really drove me into mental hell  I was only starting to comprehend the moral dimension of losing Namir and Saeed  Besides PTSD  I was suffering moral injury  Most research into this little known condition has focused on American veterans of the wars in Vietnam  Iraq and Afghanistan  A small number of experts say it helps explain the debilitating guilt and shame that some soldiers have carried home from the battlefields  Think of a soldier in Iraq who accidentally killed a civilian or blamed himself for not noticing an improvised explosive device at the side of a road that exploded and killed comrades in a vehicle behind  Or a medic in Afghanistan who blamed herself for not doing enough to save a wounded buddy  Moral injury is the damage done to a person s conscience or moral compass from something they did  failed to prevent or witnessed that transgresses their moral and ethical values  Besides guilt and shame  it can lead to rage  depression  social withdrawal and intrusive thoughts such as flashbacks and nightmares  Sufferers lose their sense of self worth  It can end in suicide   PTSD is a mental disorder that requires a diagnosis   write Shira Maguen of the University of California and Brett Litz of Boston University  two pioneers of research into moral injury   Moral injury is a dimensional problem   there is no threshold for the presence of moral injury  rather  at a given point in time  a veteran may have none  or mild to extreme manifestations   Australian clinicians have written that moral injury affects police and emergency service workers  A recent report on the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe found many journalists who covered the story suffered distress from moral injury  There is no consensus among experts on whether moral injury is a subset of PTSD or a distinct condition  Where there appears to be some agreement is that moral injury and PTSD can co exist and that it s possible to have one  and not the other  It can actually affect anyone and result from one or multiple experiences  I first heard of moral injury the week before my first admission to Ward 17 in August 2016  A former colleague mentioned the term in an email after I told him how I felt about Namir and Saeed  I found a few articles on the internet about the condition  They talked about soul repair and healing  Thinking I might be on to something  I wrote in my journal the day I was admitted   Namir and Saeed  Maybe the key is to come to some sort of acceptance and then seek atonement  How does one atone for 9 years of guilt    Moral injury  Feel this describes me   While moral injury is not recognized as a mental illness   some experts regard it as a wound to the soul   my psychiatrist in Ward 17 agreed I was suffering from it  I d been diagnosed with PTSD earlier in the year  I spent hours talking about Namir and Saeed with this perceptive psychiatrist  Dr Maryam Dar  One thing Dr Dar suggested I do was write a letter to tell Namir and Saeed how I felt  There were words I couldn t utter aloud  she reasoned  A letter might help unlock those emotions  It was a great idea  I thought  and is a healing strategy recommended by some therapists for moral injury  But it took me 10 months to work up the courage  It was only during my second admission to Ward 17 in July 2017 that I put pen to paper  I wrote for six days  Once done  I finally understood why I felt culpable over Namir and Saeed s deaths and why I felt shame for failing them in later years  A bit of background first  In the classified U S  military video released by WikiLeaks  Namir and Saeed can be seen with a group of men in a street in eastern Baghdad  a few of whom appear to be armed with AK 47s and a rocket propelled grenade launcher  all pointed downward  The men walk about casually  The U S  military said in a statement on July 13  2007  that Namir and Saeed were killed in a firefight with insurgents  The video showed that was untrue  After checking if any U S  or Iraqi forces are near the group  the Apache gunship seeks and gets permission from a U S  ground unit to attack  At that moment  the crew s line of sight is blocked by houses  so they have to circle into position  Some 20 seconds later  Namir can be seen crouched down  peering around a street corner with his long lens camera raised  He s about to photograph U S  Humvees crossing an intersection less than 100 meters away  One of the Apache s crew exclaims   He s got an RPG   About 45 seconds later the helicopter fires the first of several bursts of 30 mm rounds from its automatic cannon  Most of the men are dead  About three minutes later  Saeed can be seen wounded   but alive  He tries to get up and crawl  The crew wants to finish him off   Come on buddy   says one   All you gotta do is pick up a weapon   says the other  When Saeed comes back into view of the circling gunship  the crew sees a minivan pulling up next to him  The Apache crew tells the U S  ground unit the van is  possibly  picking up bodies and weapons and requests permission to attack  The video shows the minivan driver  Saleh Matasher Tomal  43  getting out and sliding open the cargo door  Two other men who d arrived on the scene  apparently unarmed  pick up Saeed and put him in the vehicle  The U S  ground unit grants permission to attack  The gunship fires at the van  Saeed and Tomal are killed and two of Tomal s children inside are wounded  I NEVER DID THAT I got a first  partial glimpse of the killings on July 25  2007  Two senior U S  officers gave myself and Michael Lawrence  then our global head of news at Reuters  an off the record briefing in Baghdad about the military s investigation of the attack  In one of Saddam Hussein s former palaces  we met Brigadier General Vincent Brooks  then a deputy commanding general of U S  forces in Baghdad  who oversaw the investigation  and Vice Admiral Mark Fox  the then spokesman for the U S  military in Iraq  Brooks told us a large contingent of U S  soldiers had been operating in the area since dawn on July 12  2007  to clear out Shi ite militiamen  After coming under attack from small arms and rocket propelled grenades  the U S  ground commander requested air support  Brooks said  Two Apache gunships arrived and later spotted the group of men that included Namir and Saeed  My staff had gone to the area to check reports of a U S  airstrike on a building earlier that day  Lawrence and I pressed Brooks  Had anyone from the group fired on U S  forces  Brooks said no  The Americans were taking fire from other areas  not where Namir and Saeed were  he said  But because some of the men were armed  Brooks said  the group was deemed to be expressing  hostile intent    and so  under the U S  military s rules of engagement  they could be fired upon  We objected that every household in Iraq had an AK 47 rifle  But not RPGs  said Brooks  and even if everyone had an AK 47  they should not be carrying those guns on the street  It was against the law  The generals then showed us less than three minutes of video from the Apache s gun camera  up to the exact moment it opened fire the first time  Brooks said additional footage showed a van stopping at the scene  The military had believed the driver was aiding insurgents  so it was attacked  Brooks said  Lawrence asked to see the remaining footage and to obtain a full version of the video  it was 38 minutes long  so Reuters could check whether it had been edited or manipulated  The generals refused  telling us to seek access to the tape under the U S  Freedom of Information Act  Our lawyers did so later that day  The Pentagon never handed over the tape despite several follow up attempts by Reuters  Brooks  now a four star general who commands U S  Forces Korea  declined to comment for this article  Fox  who retired from the U S  Navy in 2016  said access to combat gun camera tapes could only be granted via the Freedom of Information Act process  In my letter to Namir and Saeed  I said I couldn t understand why I had failed to ask the U S  military about its rules of engagement  Iraq at the time was the world s most dangerous country for journalists  Scores   including four from Reuters   had been killed since the U S  led invasion in 2003  I arrived in Baghdad in January 2007  just before the so called surge of 30 000 extra U S  troops into Iraq began  At no time since the invasion had U S  troops gone on such an intense offensive in Baghdad as they did during the first six months of 2007  I knew all this  and yet I did not ask for an explanation of how the rules of engagement could affect my staff  I wrote to Namir and Saeed   I never did that  and I believe it cost you both your lives   I wrote  Andrew Marshall and Alastair Macdonald  two of my predecessors as Reuters Baghdad bureau chief  told me recently that they had for years demanded to see the rules of engagement or be given confidential briefings on them  They were repeatedly rebuffed  When my nebulous but crippling sense of culpability emerged in mid 2016  family  friends and current and former Reuters colleagues assured me the deaths were not my fault  Therein lies a key problem for people with moral injury  Everyone wants to make you feel better  Some experts say this prolongs the pain  paradoxically   We have observed that intense feelings of shame and guilt can arise in situations when  by any objective analysis  the individual had no power to prevent what happened   Australian clinicians and trauma experts Zachary Steel and Dominic Hilbrink  from the St John of God psychiatric hospital in Richmond  near Sydney  wrote in an essay for a 2015 book  Moral Injury  Unseen Wounds In an Age of Barbarism  The only person who seemed to understand how I felt was a former Apache pilot who served in the same unit as the men who killed my colleagues but wasn t involved in the attack  This man  who I tracked down  wanted to be identified only by his first name  Dan  I sent him a message in December 2016  asking if he would send the Apache crew a note  I just wanted to talk to them  I said  Dan responded   It is understandable you feel at least partially responsible for the loss of people working for you   He added   I can tell you that having seen the entire tape several times  that if I had been there that day  I would have pulled the trigger myself  The weapons were easily identifiable and they were in an area where U S  ground forces had been taking fire   Dan eventually heard back from one of the four Apache crew members who were in the air that day  He didn t want to talk to me  Then there was the shame  A U S  military intelligence analyst working in Baghdad  now called Chelsea Manning  had leaked the gun camera tape and more than 700 000 other classified documents to WikiLeaks  Manning is a transgender woman formerly known as Bradley Manning  When WikiLeaks unveiled the video at a press conference in April 2010  I was on holiday with my family in Tasmania and out of phone or email range  When I learned about the tape two days later  I had a patchy internet connection  But deep down  I also wanted nothing to do with the story  It was too traumatic  I just wanted to hide  My Iraqi colleagues were livid when they saw the video of the killings  believing I had seen the entire 38 minute recording during that off the record briefing by the U S  military in Baghdad in July 2007  Lawrence and I had seen less than three minutes  We hadn t seen the attack on the van that killed Saeed  We hadn t heard the shocking banter between the pilots   Oh  yeah  look at those dead bastards   one pilot is heard saying   Nice   a comrade replies  One Iraqi colleague wrote to me a few days after the video was released   Do you know Dean  we  the Iraqis in this office  put some of the blame on you as you were one of those who saw this tape at that time and you were convinced of the pretext said by U S  army that both of our late colleagues represented at that moment a source of threat to U S army personnel      What a ridiculous point of view   That nearly broke my heart  It also dawned on me during my second stay in Ward 17  to my horror  that I had been blaming Namir for what happened  from the time I saw him lean around the corner with his camera raised in that off the record briefing in Baghdad  In my letter to Namir and Saeed  I wrote   Namir   I just cannot understand why I was thinking like this  They were going to attack whether you peered around that corner or not  For me  nine years later  and at the time  to have blamed you is beyond comprehension  How did I not see this      Maybe I was just genuinely shocked at what I saw on the video     I have buried so deep my own culpability   When the video was leaked  I should have got involved because I knew more about the story   and the backstory   than anyone  I could have made clear that permission to open fire had been given before you peered around the corner   thus avoiding the impression given by many in the media that it was the Apache mistaking your camera for an RPG that caused them to open fire   A LONG WALK I met Cath Slarks about 10 days before the anniversary  Wearing brightly colored clothes and red lipstick  Cath was 32  She was one of Austin Health s spiritual care workers  She was doing final chaplaincy studies  I told Cath I inhabited two worlds  The rational one in which I knew I was crazy to be obsessed with something that happened 10 years ago  and the other one  where I couldn t cope with the memories  I got the idea for the memorial service from Matthew Green  a British author and journalist who wrote about less mainstream methods to treat trauma in his 2015 book  Aftershock  The Untold Story of Surviving Peace  Soon after arriving at Ward 17  I emailed Green  who I worked with in Baghdad in 2004  telling him I was looking for ways to heal  Green suggested I hold what he called a private ceremony of remembrance to honor Namir and Saeed  Cath and I met several times to plan the memorial service  At one point  I said   I know it s not the right word to use  but I feel excited about this   Cath smiled and replied   It s your anticipation of doing something very meaningful for Namir and Saeed   I also wondered if I could find answers in Islam  especially about seeking forgiveness  I googled Melbourne mosques  The Elsedeaq Heidelberg Mosque was a kilometer from Ward 17  and its imam  Alaa El Zokm  lived in a house opposite the mosque  I walked there one day  Alaa opened the door of his modest brick veneer home  I introduced myself  and Alaa ushered me inside and made tea  At 28  he seemed young to be an imam  But there was a wisdom underneath his youthful demeanor  I asked Alaa about forgiveness  He said an imam can t forgive someone  only Allah can  We talked about Namir and Saeed  He said their deaths were pre ordained  It was their destiny  Alaa s use of the word  pre ordained  reminded me of what I d often heard in the Muslim world  That events  especially tragic ones  were the will of Allah  A few days later  I went to the mosque for Friday prayers  I sat in the courtyard with other worshippers  Alaa delivered his sermon in a mix of English and Arabic  My mind roamed the many years I d spent in the Muslim world  I noticed a man sitting a few rows in front of me  From behind  he looked like Saeed  On July 12  2017  the day of the memorial service  I rose early and went for a long walk  I tried to clear my mind  Cath and I met at the chapel  On the altar  I placed a framed photo of Namir and Saeed  as well as small candles and little wooden blue wrens that represented their souls  Cath put a large candle on the altar for me  In front of the altar we laid the Muslim prayer mat on the floor  It faced Mecca  Islam s holiest city  Since Namir and Saeed were Muslims  I wanted to show respect for their faith  My Indonesian friend had texted back  telling me not to stand on the mat  I stood next to it instead  Cath had the order of service on her iPad  She read out a blessing  I then started to read my letter  I had thought about this moment for many days  I wanted to show emotion  As I read  I grew frustrated  Why I am not crying  What is wrong with me  I didn t shed a single tear  We lit the candles  Cath asked if there was anything I wanted to say to Namir and Saeed  I stepped forward  looked at their photo and asked them to forgive me  Cath then asked me to place my hands over an empty bowl  I closed my eyes  She slowly poured a jug of cold water over my hands  I was transported to the Tasmanian rainforest near my home  where I often seek tranquillity on long hikes  It felt as if my hands were immersed in a stream  It stilled my mind  I felt cleansed  Cath then dipped her index finger into oil and made the sign of the cross on my forehead several times  It signified absolution  Then she asked me to blow out the candles  Smoke from the large one billowed into the air  I saw the disappearing smoke as my guilt and shame

northern Israel  an Israeli official told Reuters  Both pilots ejected and were injured  one critically  Israel then launched a second and more intensive air raid  hitting what it said were 12 Iranian and Syrian targets in Syria  including Syrian air defense systems   Lebanon s Iran backed Hezbollah group said the downing of the plane marked the  start of a new strategic phase  which would limit Israel s ability to enter Syrian airspace   Iran s involvement in Syria in support of President Bashar al Assad in a nearly seven year old civil war   including the deployment of Iran backed forces near the Israeli occupied Golan Heights   has alarmed Israel  which has said it would counter any threat  But both Israel and Syria signaled they were not seeking wider conflict  even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to military headquarters in Tel Aviv and the pro Assad alliance pledged a strong response to any Israeli  terrorist action   Russia  whose forces began intervening on behalf of Assad in 2015  expressed its concern and urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid escalation   A Western diplomat in the region said   My impression is that it seems to be contained at this point  I don t think anybody wants to escalate further   CHAIN OF EVENTS Saturday s chain of events began at 4 30 a m   0230 GMT  when an Israeli Apache  NYSE APA  helicopter shot down an Iranian drone over the northern town of Beit Shean  the Israeli military said   The drone had been sighted taking off from a base in Syria  and was intercepted after it crossed into Israeli territory  spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said  Israeli planes then struck an Iranian installation in Syria from which  the Israeli military said  the unmanned aircraft had been operated  The Israeli military released grainy black and white footage of what it said was the drone s control vehicle in Syria being destroyed  The F 16 crashed on its return from the mission  coming down in an empty field near Harduf  east of Haifa   We heard a big explosion and then sirens  We didn t know what was happening  we heard helicopters and planes in the air   said Yosi Sherer  51  who was staying at a hostel near Haifa   Flights at Tel Aviv s international airport were briefly halted   The area was quiet by mid afternoon  Conricus said missile remnants were found near the crash site   We don t know yet if it s an SA 5 or SA 17  but it s a Syrian anti aircraft missile    Israel then launched a second bombing raid in Syria  The pro Assad military alliance said Israel had attacked a drone base in central Syria but denied any of its drones had entered Israeli air space  Iran rejected the Israeli version of events as  ridiculous    David Ivry  a former Israeli Air Force chief  told Reuters he believed it was the first time an Israeli F 16 was brought down since Israel began using the jets in the 1980s  AIR SUPERIORITY Israel has long maintained air superiority in the region  mounting air strikes in Syria on a regular basis  targeting suspected weapons shipments to Hezbollah  Hezbollah said in a statement   Today s developments mean the old equations have categorically ended    Iranian and Iran backed Shi ite forces  including Hezbollah  have deployed widely in Syria in support of Assad  Iran s military chief warned Israel last October against breaching Syrian airspace and territory  Netanyahu  visiting the Golan on Tuesday  peered across the border into Syria and in public remarks warned Israel s enemies not to test its resolve   An official in the pro Assad alliance said after the downing of the F 16 that a  message  had been delivered to Israel  But he added   I do not believe matters will develop to a regional war    The Israeli military said it did not seek escalation  calling its action a defensive response to an Iranian act of aggression    The tough part is how to continue to walk a tightrope  where neither side wants an all out war  but no one wants to be the one who absorbed the blow and didn t respond appropriately   Uzi Rabi  director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University  told Israel s Channel 11 television  The U S  administration has backed Israel s hawkish stance on Iran  and declared containing Tehran s influence an objective of its Syria policy  On a visit to Israel last month  U S  Vice President Mike Pence called Iran the world s  leading state sponsor of terror   U S  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is expected to visit the region in the coming week to discuss Syria and other issues  and is scheduled to visit Jordan  Turkey  Lebanon and other countries  Tensions have also spiked across the frontier between Israel and Lebanon over Israeli plans for border wall  and Lebanese plans to exploit an offshore energy block partly located in disputed waters  Hezbollah and Israel last fought a major conflict in 2006  In Gaza  the armed wing of the Islamist group Hamas declared full alert among its fighters because of the escalation of violence in northern Israel  Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 war and has occupied it ever since  annexing the territory in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally  There has been an uneasy standoff since a ceasefire that followed a war in 1973  with United Nations observer forces manning a buffer zone between the two armies

191496,413012,APA,Tillerson says U S  ready to talk to North Korea  Japan wants pressure,news,"By David Brunnstrom and Christine Kim
WASHINGTON SEOUL  Reuters    U S  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre conditions  backing away from a key U S  demand that Pyongyang must first accept that giving up its nuclear arsenal would be part of any negotiations 
Tillerson s new diplomatic overture comes nearly two weeks after North Korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM  that put the entire United States mainland within range of its nuclear weapons 
 Let s just meet   Tillerson said in a speech to Washington s Atlantic Council think tank on Tuesday 
The White House later issued an ambiguous statement that left unclear whether President Donald Trump   who has said Tillerson was wasting his time pursuing dialogue with North Korea   had given his approval for the speech 
 The president s views on North Korea have not changed   the White House said   North Korea is acting in an unsafe way     North Korea s actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea  
In Beijing  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China welcomed all efforts to ease tension and promote dialogue to resolve the problem 
China hopes the United States and North Korea can meet each other halfway and take meaningful steps on dialogue and contact  he told reporters 
Ahead of Tillerson s speech  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to develop more nuclear weapons while personally decorating scientists and officials who contributed to the development of Pyongyang s most advanced ICBM  state media said on Wednesday 
Kim said on Tuesday the scientists and workers would continue manufacturing  more latest weapons and equipment  to  bolster up the nuclear force in quality and quantity   the KCNA news agency said 
 PERIOD OF QUIET 
While reiterating Washington s long standing position that it cannot tolerate a nuclear armed North Korea  Tillerson said the United States was  ready to talk any time they re ready to talk   but there would first have to be a  period of quiet  without nuclear and missile tests 
United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman  who visited Pyongyang last week  said senior North Korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks  but he believed he left  the door ajar  
 Time will tell what was the impact of our discussions  but I think we have left the door ajar and I fervently hope that the door to a negotiated solution will now be opened wide   Feltman told reporters after briefing the U N  Security Council on Tuesday 
Not everyone is ready for talks 
Japan has advocated a strategy of pressuring North Korea through sanctions to give up its nuclear weapons  Tokyo and Washington are in  100 percent  agreement on that stance  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday  when asked about Tillerson s comments 
A former Japanese diplomat said that  while a diplomatic solution was the  only acceptable solution   now was not the time for talks 
 We have to see the effects of sanctions on life in North Korea   the former diplomat  who asked not to be identified  told Reuters 
 I heard that they are having a serious impact on everyday life  Let s wait and see  If we were to hint anything for dialogue  we d be losing clout  
South Korea continued military exercises with the United States to check military readiness  exercises the North describes as preparation for war  The South s army said separately on Wednesday it conducted a successful air to air missile firing drill from Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters 
U S  TALKS TO CHINA
Tillerson also disclosed the United States had been talking to China about how to secure North Korea s nuclear weapons in the event of a collapse of the government in Pyongyang  He said Beijing had been given assurances that if U S  forces had to cross into North Korea they would pull back across the border into the South 
Chinese spokesman Lu would not directly answer a question about those comments  but said China had always clearly told all its interlocutors on the issue that  There can be neither war nor chaos  on the Korean peninsula 
Tillerson made clear that the United States wants to resolve the North Korea standoff through peaceful diplomacy and  in terms far more tempered than Trump s recent threats against Pyongyang  offered to hold exploratory talks 
 We can talk about the weather if you want   he said   We can talk about whether it s going to be a square table or a round table  Then we can begin to lay out a map  a road map  of what we might be willing to work towards  
Tillerson   whose influence has appeared to wane within the administration   said Trump  has encouraged our diplomatic efforts  
Trump said on Twitter in October that Tillerson was  wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man   using his derisive nickname for Kim 
North Korea  for its part  has made clear it has little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U S  mainland with a nuclear tipped missile  something most experts say it has still not proved 
Tillerson also said the United States was working to tighten enforcement of international sanctions against North Korea  especially further measures that China can apply  and that Washington had a full menu of military options if such a response was needed 
Daryl Kimball  executive director of the non partisan Arms Control Association  said Tillerson s proposal was overdue but added   In order to get to such talks going  the U S  side as well as North Korea must demonstrate more restraint

191506,413022,APA,It ll Take Oil Above  50 for Shale Boom  Oil Sands to Pay Off,news," Bloomberg     Shale drillers and oil sands producers have posted some healthy profits so far this year  but it ll take oil consistently above  50 a barrel for their investments to pay off in the long run 
That s the conclusion of a Moody s Investors Service study of 37 exploration and production companies in the U S  and Canada released Thursday  It s also why legendary hedge fund manager Jim Chanos  who s shorting shale driller Continental Resources Inc   says independent explorers have been a bad deal for shareholders 
Shale oil producers  are creatures of the capital markets   Chanos told Bloomberg TV s Julia Chatterley  Joe Weisenthal and Scarlet Fu   Because the wells deplete so quickly  they constantly need to raise money to replace the assets  
Producers in the U S  and Canada have made dramatic efforts to cut costs since the collapse of oil prices three years ago  with many delivering higher dividends to investors this year  But with limited wiggle room to reduce costs further  any improvement in their ability to sustain healthy returns will have to come from commodity prices  Moody s analysts Sreedhar Kona and Steven Wood said in the report 
The two analysts used a measure of how efficiently cash is generated to cover the costs of leasing drilling rights and boring wells  and still have enough left over to invest in future projects 
 Companies will be able to demonstrate meaningful capital efficiency  measured by the leveraged full cycle ratio  only if the West Texas Intermediate oil price is above  50 per barrel and the Henry Hub natural gas price is at lnatural gasper million British thermal units   they said 
With a few notable exceptions like Appalachian explorers Antero Resources Corp  and  Range Resources Corp     as well as Canadian shal  NYSE RRC e gas producer Seven Generations Energy Ltd   the ratio for the vast majority was way below a level Moody s considers healthy 
Interestingly  the three best performers are focused on liquids rich gas plays    the Marcellus and Utica formations in the northeastern U S  and the Montney shale in Alberta  Antero and Seven Generations have seen their cash flow from operations surge over the past few years  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Producers  leveraged full cycle ratio needs to be significantly above 1 for explorers to earn a meaningful return on their investment  the Moody s analysts said  The average for the 37 explorers was 0 59 last year  according to the study  The ratios for the top three performers were above 1 5  Antero s 2 19 ratio tops the list 
Among the lowest ranking were  Apache Corp    and  Devon Energy  Corp   with ratio  NYSE APA s below 0 05  according  NYSE DVN  to the report ",2017-10-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/itll-take-oil-above-50-for-shale-boom-oil-sands-to-pay-off-535072,535072

that opened and played 78  and 45 rpm records  I bought a lot of calypso and Johnny Mathis  whatever was popular in the fifties  My father was pretty unhappy with that purchase  because he was a

Air Force Materiel Command First job  Cutting apricots I grew up in the small town of Hollister  California  surrounded by orchards and produce fields  When my dad served in Vietnam  back when I was 11 or 12  my sister and I decided we wanted to earn some money  We got jobs cutting apricots   using a paring knife  slicing around the pit  dividing the fruit in two  and laying it on pallets to dry in the sun  Most of our fellow workers were Hispanic  who didn t speak any English  but they were so skilled at it  These women had been doing it for years  I learned a couple of important lessons from them  first  a strong work ethic  These women didn t take breaks  and worked in the hot sun all day  and that money was so important to their families  Second  the power of teamwork  I remember one day  after I had been working on my single pallet for hours  a woman came over without saying a word and helped me finish  just so I could get paid for the day  After five weeks  I made a grand total of  32 that summer  It was the first and hardest earned wages of my life  I treasured that money  and put it in the bank  To me  it was a very big deal  Charles Jacoby Jr  Four star general

high school  he said  OK  now is the time to really learn how to work   So I ended up working on a drill rig for two summers as a roughneck in Watkins Glen  New York  It was unbelievably hard work  We fixed broken wells  or fished tools out of holes  or capped old wells   12 hours a day  seven days a week  It was pretty demanding stuff  but I knew I couldn t let my dad down  By the end of the day  you were a mess  But learning how to get through a blue collar day like that made you very proud  and very respectful of other men who are able to do that  It was a fundamental experience for me  Slinging pipe around  working with heavy equipment  It was very much like a day in the U S  Army  minus somebody shooting at you  It was also a pretty dangerous place  with chains falling out of derricks and pipes breaking loose  It was the first time I saw people really get hurt  It made me realize safety is not just a buzzword  Just like in the Army  Getting your guys out safely is part of

191523,413039,APA,Exclusive  U S  forces to stay in Syria for decades  say militia allies,news,"By John Davison
AIN ISSA  Syria  Reuters    Washington s main Syrian ally in the fight against Islamic State says the U S  military will remain in northern Syria long after the jihadists are defeated  predicting enduring ties with the Kurdish dominated region 
The U S  backed Syrian Democratic Forces  SDF   an alliance of militias dominated by the Kurdish YPG  believes the United States has a  strategic interest  in staying on  SDF spokesman Talal Silo told Reuters 
 They have a strategy policy for decades to come  There will be military  economic and political agreements in the long term between the leadership of the northern areas  of Syria      and the U S  administration   Silo said 
The U S  led coalition against Islamic State has deployed forces at several locations in northern Syria  including an airbase near the town of Kobani  It has supported the SDF with air strikes  artillery  and special forces on the ground 
Asked about long term strategy  Col  Ryan Dillon  spokesman for the coalition  referred Reuters to the Pentagon  He said there was  still a lot of fighting to do  even after ISIS has been defeated in Raqqa  
Islamic State remained in strongholds along the Euphrates River Valley  he added  in a reference to its stronghold in Deir al Zor province southeast of Raqqa 
 Our mission     is to defeat ISIS in designated areas of Iraq and Syria and to set conditions for follow on operations to increase regional stability   Dillon said  without elaborating 
Eric Pahon  a Pentagon spokesman  said in Washington   The Department of Defense does not discuss timelines for future operations  However we remain committed to the destruction of ISIS and preventing its return  
The SDF and YPG dominate a swathe of northern Syria where Kurdish led autonomous administrations have emerged since the onset of the Syrian conflict in 2011 
The YPG and its allies hold an uninterrupted 400 km  250 mile  stretch of the Syrian Turkish border 
The U S  alliance with the SDF and YPG is a major point of contention with neighboring Turkey  a U S  ally  Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party  PKK   which has fought a three decade insurgency in Turkey 
Silo said   The Americans have strategic interests here after the end of Daesh   using a pejorative term for Islamic State 
NEW BASES 
 They  recently  referred to the possibility of securing an area to prepare for a military airport  These are the beginnings   they re not giving support just to leave  America is not providing all this support for free   Silo said 
He suggested northern Syria could become a new base for U S  forces in the region   Maybe there could be an alternative to their base in Turkey   he added  referring to the Incirlik air base 
The head of the YPG said last month the United States had established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria controlled by the YPG or SDF  including a major air base near Kobani  a town at the border with Turkey 
The coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces  citing operational security 
Reuters reporters have seen Blackhawk and Apache  NYSE APA  military helicopters taking off from a cement factory southeast of Kobani  a Kurdish town on the border with Turkey 
Washington under the new U S  administration of President Donald Trump started distributing arms to the YPG in March ahead of the final assault on Raqqa city  infuriating Turkey which has been unsuccessfully lobbying Washington to abandon the SDF 
Despite SDF confidence that U S  forces will stay  there is concern that Washington will not give enough backing to YPG allied forces and civil councils that control northeast Syria 
 We re constantly asking them for clear  public political support   Silo said  He said the U S  State Department held its first public meeting with SDF officials this month 

 At the moment there are no meetings being held for a real discussion of Syria s future  There are initiatives for developing political support for our forces  but we hope this will be bigger   he said ",2017-08-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive-us-forces-to-stay-in-syria-for-decades-say-militia-allies-519728,519728

191533,413049,APA,Massive copper mine tests Trump s push to slash regulation,news,"By Emily Flitter
SUPERIOR  Arizona  Reuters     Rio Tinto  s proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona would tunnel 7 000 feet underground  where rocks radiate heat from the earth s molten core  It would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and 1 000 feet deep 
Planned for more than a decade  the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive U S  mines as companies run out of easy to reach deposits  geologists say  It is also the project President Donald Trump s Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross  had in mind as he began crafting a  hit list  of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting 
 A company shouldn t have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved   Ross told Reuters in a May 9 interview  referring to the mine 
The massive project   which would be among the world s largest copper mines   underscores the dangers of weakening America s rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky  And Ross s citation of Resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the Trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth 
Sorting out the mine s potentially negative impacts is anything but simple  and many local residents  along with Native American and environmental groups  say Resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny   no matter how long it takes 
 The companies have to mitigate their risks   mitigate what people are losing   said Mila Besich Lira  the mayor of Superior  the town closest to the project 
A federal government review of the project has drawn about 130 000 comments from concerned constituents   more than 10 times the number who gave input on the smaller Rosemont Copper Mine nearby 
The Resolution mine would also give the region a big economic boost  employing 1 400 people and injecting  20 billion into public coffers  Rio Tinto  L RIO  estimates  It could supply the United States with a quarter of its copper  putting this small town at the epicenter of the global metals market 
Trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost America trillions of dollars with no public benefit 
The regulatory review by Ross  due for release as soon as this month  is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape  Trump has also started dismantling Obama era climate change regulations through executive orders  for example  and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create 
In the meantime  Congress could set the tone  A Republican bill introduced early this year   and supported by Rio Tinto   would set a two and a half year deadline on mine permitting  a standard similar to that seen in Australia and Canada 
DEEPER  HOTTER  BIGGER
Rio Tinto   along with the Australian mining company BHP Billiton  L BLT   which owns a 45 percent stake in Resolution   says it has spent 16 years and  1 3 billion on the project  including a decade acquiring acreage in the Tonto National Forest overlying the copper deposit 
It is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines  a process that can take seven to 10 years  Victoria Peacey  a senior manager for environmental permitting at Rio Tinto  said the mine up probably won t begin operating for another decade 
Rio Tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans 
 There are mines this deep  there are mines this hot  and there are mines this big  but there are no other mines this deep  this hot and this big all together   said Carl Hehnke  a geologist for Resolution 
Resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run 180 degrees Fahrenheit  With help from remotely controlled machines  miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit 
The ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as 6 5 billion gallons of water a year   enough to supply more than half the homes in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe 
It would eventually render more than 2 400 acres of what is now the Tonto National Forest off limits to visitors 
Under the forest  in a process called  block cave mining   Rio Tinto will excavate material from underground  making the material above sink and creating the expected one and a half mile wide crater 
That area will include a site considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache  NYSE APA  Tribe  which has been holding annual protests against the project 
YEARS OF SCRUTINY
If Resolution s copper deposit had been discovered under private land   and not a national forest   Rio Tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators  Instead  the U S  Forest Service is leading the study  which will consider jobs  recreation  public health and wildlife 
Despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of Superior  where many homes and businesses are boarded up  residents still have their concerns 
 What am I going to tell my great grandkids   how this place was totally destroyed   said Anna Jeffries  a Superior resident  during an April 2016 public meeting with Forest Service officials at Superior High School 
Mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process 
 We are not talking in any way  shape or form about any environmental rollbacks here   said Katie Sweeney  general counsel for the National Mining Association  a trade group   We re talking about bureaucracy  
The NMA wants to see deadlines for permitting  along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively 
The NMA and Rio Tinto back the bill   introduced in January by Republican Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada   that would give regulators the two and a half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects 
Mining companies in Canada and Australia applaud similar time limits in those countries  but a May 2016 report by a government watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia found Canada s mine regulation had  major gaps in resources  planning and tools  that led to  inadequate  inspections and  increasing environmental risks  
Commerce Secretary Ross told Reuters in a June 23 phone message he believed the U S  Forest Service was doing  a good job in terms of Rio Tinto   But he added   The rest of the process has been so abysmal that Rio Tinto actually testified before the U S  Congress  about  how bad the process was  
Ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between Resolution and permit issuing agencies 
But his office said he was referring to Congressional testimony given by Rio Tinto s Managing Director for Copper and Diamonds  Nigel Steward  in March  Steward called the U S  permitting process  inefficient  and said it  presents a major barrier to the domestic sector s ability to perform to its full potential  
Rio Tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved   along with more money for agencies  to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting   said Todd Malan  Rio Tinto s vice president for external affairs and communications for the Americas 
While the company supports permitting deadlines  at least one Rio Tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the Resolution mine in less than years 
 I m not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful  but three years      That s a tight time frame   said Peacey 
While uncertain permitting timeframes raise financial risks for Rio Tinto  she said  the sometimes lengthy process also protects the public 
 Those are people s rights   she said

191554,413070,APA,Need to avoid civilian deaths weighs on minds of U S  forces in Mosul battle,news,"By Angus MacSwan QAYYARA WEST AIRFIELD  Iraq  Reuters    As the battle for Mosul moves to the narrow streets and densely packed houses of the Old City  U S  artillery gunners and helicopter pilots supporting Iraqi forces face an age old problem   how to avoid killing civilians  They place their faith in precision missiles which can hit their target with great accuracy  But human instinct also comes into play against an Islamic State enemy which has used civilians as human shields and hides in houses and mosques   Our mission is to find and destroy ISIS  We are not here to kill the wrong people   said Captain Lucas Gebhart  commander of the 4 6th Cavalry s Bravo Troop of Apache  NYSE APA  attack helicopters  The troop is based at this airfield about 60 kms south of Mosul  as is a rocket battery which fires into west Mosul  A major site at the height of the U S  occupation  Islamic State captured Qayyara from Iraqi government forces in 2014 and destroyed it  The Iraqis retook it in July last year  and now the U S  Army is building it up again as a support base for the Mosul operation  Gebhart  who wore a U S  Cavalry hat with a crossed sabre insignia along with his regular uniform  has been here since December  The troop flies close support for the Iraqi army and escorts medical evacuations  It has had more than 200 engagements with Islamic State fighters in that time  he said   We fly every day  weather permitting  We are firing missiles most of the time   Gebhart told reporters  The Iraqi army started its offensive on Mosul  Islamic State s last stronghold in Iraq  in October and retook the east side of the city  bisected by the Tigris river  in January  The west  including the Old City  is much harder going   The west side is very congested and it will present new challenges for us  We realize the need to be careful as we go forward   Gebhart said  One of those challenges is avoiding civilian casualties in a conflict where fighters are mixed in among the population and sometimes hiding behind them   Everyone that flies with me are fathers and husbands  so we are very deliberate to avoid casualties we don t want  We use guided missiles  The things we shoot from an Apache  they go where we want them to go   Gebhart said  Targets are identified and approved by the Iraqi army  But circumstances can change in a moment   I have personal experience of human shields  I engaged a target and they pulled a family of women and children out of a house  The missile was already in the air but I was able to move it   he said   You ve got a little bit of time  If something happens post missile release  we have procedures to move it   Gebhart  aged 32  joined the military as a teenager after the 9 11 attacks on the United States  He served in the 82nd Airborne in Iraq in 2003 before going to West Point and becoming a cavalry officer  He also served two tours of duty in Afghanistan   I love my job  I don t lose sleep over it   he said       WE LOVE TO FIRE In another section of the base  the 18th Field Artillery  Odin  battery operates a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System  HIMARS   fired off the back of trucks  On Friday afternoon  the battery fired 10 rockets  each worth about  100 000  in the space of about 20 minutes  They headed skywards in a cloud of white smoke and a flash of fire as a Bob Marley song played from a platoon tent  They would reach their target in east Mosul in about a minute  Lieutenant Mary Floyd explained that the rockets were GPS guided  All fire missions were approved by senior officers at the Combined Joint Operations Center and the coordinates were sent to the battery through computers   The rockets go really high so we have to clear airspace    civilian and military    along the flight path  We have had to end missions because they saw aviation   she said  Although rockets are often aimed at targets in built up  populated areas  the battery was confident they would hit what they intended  If the rockets are off target  they do not detonate  she said   They have very  very low collateral damage  so we like to use them a lot   Floyd said  using the military term for civilian casualties   When the rockets hit they land at near a vertical angle  That really confines the blast to one house   The battery has fired hundreds of rockets since deploying to Qayyara  she said   The tempo changes  We ll go a couple of days without orders  Then we might be firing all night   The issue of civilian casualties has dogged the U S  military during its long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  from shootings at check points to drone bombings  In the battle for Mosul  Iraqi and U S  led coalition war planes have also been pounding parts of the city  Figures of such casualties are hard to come by  Washington has stressed its forces take every effort to avoid them  On Tuesday  a prominent Iraqi politician and businessman  Khamis Khanjar  said at least 3 500 civilians have been killed in west Mosul since the offensive closed in on it  The U S  led coalition said in a statement that up to March 4  it had assessed that  more likely than not   at least 220 civilians had been unintentionally killed by coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve  While the men and women of Odin battery were fully aware of the risk  they believe in their work

advancing Iraqi forces has become a lifeline for civilians as more and more of the northern city breaks loose from the grip of the ultra hardline militants  Men and women  children and the elderly scramble down the banks of the Khosr River  a tributary of the Tigris some 30 meters wide and a meter deep which counter terrorism forces crossed last week in a nighttime raid  Lumbering over ladders and pipes  civilians crawl onto the span of the bridge  which has collapsed into the murky water  and shimmy up the opposite bank along a dirt path  Those escaping east to Zuhur district drag suitcases along with strollers and wheelchairs  Those returning west to Muthanna carry sacks of rice  potatoes and onions  cartons of eggs and packs of baby diapers  The journey in either direction is usually several kilometers   Now there are people entering and people leaving   Major General Sami al Aridi told Reuters this week after touring both sides of the river on foot   The ones who left are returning  and those who are leaving now are coming from     neighborhoods where there are currently clashes   He said he expected the latest evacuees to return in a day or two as Iraqi forces pushed further west  The United Nations had warned that the U S  backed campaign to kick Islamic State out of Mosul  their largest urban stronghold in Iraq or Syria  could displace up to 1 5 million people  But with much of the eastern half of the city now under government control  most residents have stayed in their homes or moved in temporarily with relatives in other neighborhoods  That has complicated the task of the military  which must fight among civilians in built up areas against an enemy that has targeted non combatants and hidden among them  HARSH CONDITIONS The offensive  involving a 100 000 strong ground force of Iraqi troops  members of the autonomous Kurdish security forces and mainly Shi ite militiamen  is the most complex battle in Iraq since the U S  led invasion

three months to drive the militants out  Fawaz  a 46 year old schoolteacher going back across the ruptured bridge to his family s home in Muthanna on Monday  held a jerry can filled with fuel in one hand and a bag of fresh food in the other   We spent two months without food  just what we had stored up   he said  describing the harsh conditions that many residents faced after the Mosul campaign began in mid October  Fawaz said he lost some 30 kg  66 lb  in that period  He crossed the river earlier in the day to buy supplies and check in with his old workplace but was returning before nightfall to his neighborhood  where Iraqi forces are now in charge but mortars fired by Islamic State still land  He shrugged off the danger with a laugh and  expressing the deep faith that Mosul residents say sustained them through 2 1 2 years of brutal Islamic State rule  said   God is present   ACCUSTOMED TO VIOLENCE Along a road running west towards the city s ancient ruins  black armored Humvees race down one side  transporting soldiers to and from the frontline where they re fighting Islamic State suicide attackers with machine guns  rockets and air strikes  Civilians  including

191567,413083,APA,Obama shortens sentence of Manning  who gave secrets to WikiLeaks,news,"By Roberta Rampton and Ayesha Rascoe WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Barack Obama on Tuesday shortened the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning  the former U S  military intelligence analyst who was responsible for a 2010 leak of classified materials to anti secrecy group WikiLeaks  the biggest such breach in U S  history  A White House official said there was no connection between Manning s commutation and renewed U S  government concern about WikiLeaks  actions during last year s presidential election  or a promise by founder Julian Assange to accept extradition if Manning was freed  Manning has been a focus of a worldwide debate on government secrecy since she provided more than 700 000 documents  videos  diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks   a leak for which she was sentenced to serve 35 years in prison  Obama  in one of his final acts before leaving office  reduced her sentence to seven years  angering some Republicans   This is just outrageous   House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement  Ryan  a Republican  said the decision was a  dangerous precedent  for those who leak materials about national security   Chelsea Manning s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation s most sensitive secrets   Ryan said  Manning was working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2010 when she gave WikiLeaks a trove of diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts that included a 2007 gunsight video of a U S  Apache  NYSE APA  helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq  killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff  Republican Senator Tom Cotton said the leak endangered troops  intelligence officers  diplomats and allies   We ought not treat a traitor like a martyr   Cotton said  TOOK RESPONSIBILITY Manning  formerly known as U S  Army Private First Class Bradley Manning  was born male but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman  The White House said her sentence would end on May 17 this year  Manning  who twice tried to kill herself last year and has struggled to cope as a transgender woman in the Fort Leavenworth  Kansas  men s military prison  accepted responsibility for leaking the material    a factor that fed into Obama s decision  a White House official told reporters  speaking on condition of anonymity  The official said Obama s decision was rooted in Manning s sentence being longer than sentences given to others who had committed comparable crimes  Obama  who leaves office on Friday and is scheduled to give his final news conference on Wednesday  is expected to discuss his decision then  WikiLeaks also published emails in the weeks leading up to the Nov  8 presidential election that U S  intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of leading Democrats  part of a campaign by Moscow to influence the election  But Obama s decision had nothing to do with the latest WikiLeaks controversy  the White House official said   The president s decision to grant clemency and offer commutation to Chelsea Manning was not influenced in any way by public comments from Assange or the WikiLeaks organization   a White House official said on a conference call with reporters  Assange has been holed up at Ecuador s London embassy since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden for the investigation of allegations  which he denies  that he committed rape there in 2010  He has said he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States  where there is an open criminal investigation into the activities of WikiLeaks  WikiLeaks sent a tweet quoting Assange s attorney  Melinda Taylor  saying he would abide by his promise to accept extradition if Manning was freed   Everything that he has said he s standing by   Taylor said  according to the tweet  Civil rights groups praised the move  calling it overdue   Chelsea Manning exposed serious abuses  and as a result her own human rights have been violated by the U S  government for years   said Margaret Huang  executive director of Amnesty International USA  STUXNET Obama also pardoned retired U S  Marine Corps General James Cartwright who pleaded guilty in October to making false statements to the FBI during an investigation into leaks of classified information  The aggressive prosecution of Cartwright  who last served as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  sent shockwaves through the Pentagon  He lied during questioning by the FBI over a book written by a New York Times reporter that exposed a malicious computer software program known as  Stuxnet  designed to disrupt Iran s nuclear program  Cartwright denied being the source of the leak  Obama weighed Cartwright s service along with his motive when making the decision  the White House official said  noting Cartwright had not divulged material that the journalist was not already aware of  and that his conversations were focused on preventing the publication of material that could hurt national security   It s clear in this case     that General Cartwright s motive was different than most people who are facing charges of leaking classified information to a journalist   the official said  PUERTO RICAN MILITANT Also on the pardon list  Oscar Lopez Rivera  who was sentenced in 1981 to 55 years in prison for his involvement with Puerto Rican militant group FALN  which claimed responsibility for dozens of bombings in the 1970s and 1980s  Lopez Rivera    who turned down a similar offer from President Bill Clinton in 1999    was the last remaining member of FALN still in prison   Mr  Lopez Rivera is now in his 70s  He has served 35 years  nearly half of his life in prison   a White House official said   The president determined that was sufficient amount of time to serve  although the president certainly believes that the crimes that were committed were serious   U S  Senator Bernie Sanders campaigned for the release of Lopez Rivera during his unsuccessful campaign against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination  Manning and Lopez Rivera were among 209 commutations granted by Obama on Tuesday and Cartwright was among 64 pardons  In total  Obama has commuted sentences for 1 385 federal prisoners    a total greater than that of the 12 previous presidents combined    and he is expected to announce more on Thursday  the White House official said  
Most of the commutations were a part of Obama s effort to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for non violent drug offenses   additional reporting by Phillip Stewart  Patricia Zengerle and Dustin Volz ",2017-01-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/obama-shortens-sentence-of-manning,-who-gave-secrets-to-wikileaks-453752",453752

191570,413086,APA,Canadian agency breached as hackers exploit new software bug,news," Reuters    Canada s government said on Monday that it shut down its website for filing federal taxes after hackers broke into a web server at the nation s statistics bureau last week by exploiting a newly disclosed software bug 
Statistics Canada  which said it stopped the intrusion before hackers stole any data  is the first high profile organization to say it was hacked due to a new security bug in software known as Apache  NYSE APA  Struts 2  The software is commonly used in websites of governments  banks  retailers and other large organizations 
Other victims have not yet come forth  although security firms said they expect more attacks to surface after details on the easy to exploit vulnerability were posted on security forums and hacking websites last week 
Technicians at big corporations and government agencies around the world spent the weekend combing their networks for vulnerable software and patching it  said Chris Camacho  chief strategy officer with cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint 
He said the vulnerability was actively being exploited by hackers  but declined to provide details  citing client confidentiality 
The impact of the vulnerability surfaced in Canada late Friday when the federal government shut down the tax agency s website to prevent attacks after it identified that it was running vulnerable software 
 We went after this one specifically because we recognized there was a specific and credible threat to certain government IT systems   John Glowacki  a government security official  said at a press conference 
Glowacki said he that he understood some other countries  are actually having greater problems with this specific vulnerability   but declined to identify the nations or discuss the problems 
The vulnerability surfaced last week when the Apache Software Foundation released an update to fix the bug  saying it could enable hackers to gain remote control of a web server 
That could allow them to steal data  secretly gain access to a victim s network or shut down a website  said Chris Wysopal  chief technology officer with security software maker Veracode 
 This vulnerability is super easy to exploit   Wysopal said   You just point it to the web server and put in the command that you want to run  ",2017-03-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/canada-says-patches-major-websites-after-discovering-vulnerability-465772,465772

Besides the changes in targets that American warplanes are allowed to attack  the U S  military now has a  more mature  relationship with the Afghans that allows air strikes to be called in more effectively is support of the government troops  Rider said in a recent interview at Bagram airfield ",2016-10-26,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/u.s.-air-strikes-spike-as-afghans-struggle-against-taliban,-islamic-state-434735",434735
191581,413097,APA, Crashing waves  of jihadists fray soldiers  nerves in Mosul battle,news,"By Dominic Evans and Ahmed Rasheed BAGHDAD  Reuters    A week after his tank division punched through Islamic State defenses on the southeast edge of Mosul  an Iraqi army colonel says the fight to drive the militants out of their urban stronghold is turning into a nightmare  Against a well drilled  mobile and brutally effective enemy  exploiting the cover of built up neighborhoods and the city s civilian population  his tanks were useless  he said  and his men untrained for the urban warfare they face  His Ninth Armoured Division and elite counter terrorism units fighting nearby seized six of some 60 neighborhoods last week  the first gains inside Mosul since the Oct  17 start of a campaign to crush Islamic State in its Iraqi fortress  Even that small foothold is proving hard to maintain  however  with waves of counter attacks by jihadist units including snipers and suicide bombers who use a network of tunnels stretching for miles  km  under the city  They appear able to strike at will  often at night  denying the troops rest and rattling frayed nerves   We re an armored brigade  and fighting without being able to use tanks and with soldiers unused to urban warfare is putting troops in a tough situation   the officer told Reuters  He asked not to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media  A year ago  when his forces took part in an operation to drive Islamic State from the much smaller city of Ramadi west of Baghdad  they were tasked with holding territory outside while the counter terrorism forces entered the city  Mosul  whose capture is a crucial step towards dismantling the caliphate Islamic State declared two years ago across large areas of Iraq and Syria  is too big for specialist forces alone   In Mosul  we have to advance inside residential areas  comb streets  clear houses from terrorists and deal with civilians  I m afraid this job is too tough for us to handle   He said it was impossible to differentiate between civilians and fighters who melt in amongst them  Islamic State has forced its dress code on the population during the two years it has controlled the city  Men are required to have long beards  something the militants are still policing   Our soldiers can t recognize them until it s too late  when the attacker either detonates his explosive vest or throws a grenade   the colonel said  adding that he lost two T 72 tanks and an armored vehicle in a single day s fighting on Tuesday   It s becoming a nightmare and it s nerve wracking for the soldiers   he said  TOUGHEST URBAN WAR Even for the Counter Terrorism Service  or special forces  trained more specifically for the challenges in Mosul  the last week of fighting has been unprecedented   We are carrying out the toughest urban warfare that any force in the world could undertake   CTS spokesman Sabah al Numani said on Sunday  One CTS officer  in Baghdad on leave  told Reuters the biggest threat came from snipers   You don t know where or when a sniper will strike   he said  That  combined with thousands of people trying to escape the fighting  was a constant source of stress   As he spoke  a voice on his radio crackled   one of his men on the frontline   Sir  there are so many civilians  they have these suitcases with them as well  How do I know what s in them  And they re coming towards me     Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi  who declared a crossborder caliphate in Syria and Iraq from the pulpit of a Mosul mosque two years ago  told his fighters last week there could be no retreat in a  total war  with their enemies  Hisham al Hashemi  who advises the Iraqi government on Islamic State issues and has visited the frontlines  said all the indications from Mosul so far showed that Baghdadi s comments were no idle threat   Now Daesh  Islamic State  is really fighting   he said  Hashemi said the jihadists had dug a 70 km  45 mile  network of tunnels just on the eastern side of the Tigris River  which runs through the center of Mosul  since they took over in 2014  Using the tunnels they were able to surprise troops inside the city  striking between 2 am and dawn when their defenses are at their lowest   They are not ready for these surprises   it s the tunnels which have caused our greatest losses   he said   CRASHING WAVES  Hashemi said government forces were only in full control of two of the districts they entered last week  The army says it has captured five other districts  but fighting continues in all of them and Hashemi said in some neighborhoods the army had been driven back three or four times   often at night   before reclaiming territory the next day  With its tanks unable to navigate narrow city streets  the Iraqi army has called on U S  Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters to target car bombers  The Pentagon said on Monday they would continue to be used  in what we expect will be tough fighting to come    One of the most devastating tactics the militants employed  which helped them tie down a far greater force than their own  was to send consecutive waves of small units   about 50 strong   against the troops so they could never let down their guard  The militants call the operation  crashing waves   Each unit includes suicide bombers  snipers  assault fighters  and what they call infiltrators  as well as logistics and mortar experts   Each one only fights for a short period and is then relieved by the next group   it exhausts the army   Hashemi said  Although they face a coalition of Iraqi army  special forces  Kurdish peshmerga and Shi ite paramilitary groups which may total around 100 000 fighters  the asymmetric war strategy has so far meant the 5 000 strong jihadists in Mosul have tied down the advancing troops  without using their full reserves  Hashemi said an inner core of mainly Francophone foreign fighters  given the name  al Murabitoun   Guards  had taken an oath to fight to the death defending strategic positions in the heart of the city    The only way they will leave is when they are dead   he said  adding they were also holding residents as human shields against air strikes  So far the advancing forces have only breached eastern Mosul  Hashemi said two infantry divisions which have advanced close to its northern and southern limits were preparing to open two new fronts in the city  possibly as soon as Friday  
Ultimately  he said the superior numbers of the forces attacking on multiple fronts would wear down the militants   We will win  without doubt  But it will be a costly victory  ",2016-11-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/'crashing-waves'-of-jihadists-fray-soldiers'-nerves-in-mosul-battle-439406,439406

Mosul on Friday despite heavy resistance from Islamic State militants using civilians as cover  and were holding half a dozen city neighborhoods seized in the last 10 days  The elite Counter Terrorism Service troops broke through Islamic State defense lines to enter the city early last week and have since been embroiled in a brutal  close quarter combat with waves of suicide bombers and snipers  The special forces are the spearhead of a wider coalition of 100 000 fighters seeking to crush a few thousand Islamic State jihadists who have ruled Mosul  the biggest city of their cross border  caliphate  in Iraq and Syria  for the last two years  The campaign  nearly four weeks old  is the most complex military operation in Iraq in the 13 years of turmoil since the U S  invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein  Security forces and army infantry divisions  backed by a U S  led air force  are preparing to move on southern and northern districts of Mosul in coming days  to step up pressure on the militants   Kurdish peshmerga and Shi ite paramilitary forces are holding territory to the northeast and to the west  On the eastern front  special forces pushed into the Qadisiya al Thaniya district  on the northern edge of the small pocket of neighborhoods they control so far  Sabah al Numani  spokesman for the Counter Terrorism Service  told Reuters   We have encountered heavy resistance from the enemy   he said  with what he called  obstructive patrols  of militant forces trying to hold up the advance   We are facing the most difficult form of urban warfare  fighting with the presence of civilians  but our forces are trained for this sort of combat   Military officers have told Reuters that the fighting is some of the most lethal they have seen  with small groups of militants using a vast network of tunnels and narrow streets to launch an apparently endless sequence of attacks against troops  A Reuters correspondent in Kokjali  on the eastern edge of the city  saw U S  Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters overhead  Explosions  either from air strikes or suicide car bombs which the jihadists have deployed in the hundreds since the campaign started on Oct  17  could be heard against a backdrop of artillery fire  As smoke rose above the city  hundreds of civilians were on the streets of Kokjali  some of them local residents but others fleeing the fighting in Mosul itself  The International Organization for Migration says nearly 48 000 people have been displaced by the fighting  still a relatively low figure compared to a United Nations warning before the campaign of a possible exodus of up to 800 000  Numani said the army had told civilians to stay indoors for their safety  adding that the counter terrorism unit aimed to hand over neighborhoods which it had secured to other forces  In other cities retaken from Islamic State  local police forces have moved in after the special forces have cleared territory  KILLINGS AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS Islamic State s two year reign of fear in northern and western Iraq threatened the country with disintegration  and Prime Minister Haider al Abadi says it has cost Iraq  35 billion in economic damage  On Friday  Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani praised the forces battling Islamic State  including thousands of Shi ite fighters in the Popular Mobilisation paramilitary forces  for their sacrifices   Without  the blood of these dear ones and their continuous steadfastness  only God would know what fate would await Iraq and others   said Seyyid Ahmed al Safi  who delivered the Friday sermon in the holy city of Kerbala on behalf of the aged and reclusive Shi ite religious leader  Inside Mosul  a city which is still home to up to 1 5 million people  residents said this week that the militants had killed at least 20 people and displayed their bodies   five of them crucified   as a warning against acting as informants for Iraqi forces  The U N  human rights office said a total of 40 people were reportedly shot on Tuesday for  treason and collaboration  with Iraqi security forces  and a 27 year old man was shot for using a mobile phone  Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani also said the jihadists were reportedly stockpiling ammonia and sulfur in civilian areas  possibly for use as chemical weapons  A source in the city contacted by Reuters said the militants were allowing some relatives of Islamic State supporters to evacuate and head west to Syria  Routes out of Mosul to Islamic State s Syrian stronghold of Raqqa appear still to be open  despite efforts by the mainly Shi ite Hashid Shaabi forces to cut them off   The source said he had seen five families leaving Mosul  One departing person said they had permission from Islamic State and  no one will stop us on the road from Mosul to Raqqa   In the eastern district of Karama  where fighting continued  one resident said militants were riding around on motorbikes   We can bear the bombardment and the clashes to get rid of Daesh  Islamic State   We want to be liberated and despite all this fear we are staying in our houses   he said  In nearby Qadisiya al Thania  stormed by special forces on Friday  a woman said the clashes were so fierce she was too scared to go into the kitchen to cook  so she fed her family dates   The sound of clashes grew more distant  and then fighters reached us and raised the Iraqi flag and told us they had pushed out Daesh and liberated us   she said by phone   We never thought we d be free of Daesh  We can still hear clashes and we hope they don t come back again

stronghold in Iraq entered a second month on Thursday as forces arrayed against the hardline Sunni group sought finally to seal off Mosul from all sides  The militants have been steadily retreating from areas around Mosul into the city since the battle started on Oct  17  with air and ground support from a U S  led coalition  An elite army unit  the Counter Terrorism Service  breached the city s eastern limits for the first time two weeks ago  Other army units have yet to enter from the northern and the southern sides  Another breakthrough came on Wednesday  when Iranian backed militias announced the capture of an air base west of Mosul  part of their campaign to choke off the route between the Syrian and Iraqi parts of the caliphate Islamic State declared in 2014  The capture of the Tal Afar base also offers the mainly Shi ite forces a launchpad for operations against Islamic State targets inside Syria  and highlights the potential for the Mosul operation to reshape strategic power across northern Iraq  To the east of Mosul  Kurdish peshmerga forces are also taking territory well outside the traditional borders of their autonomous region  The offensive to take Mosul  the largest city under Islamic State control in either Iraq or Syria  is turning into the biggest battle in Iraq s turbulent history since the U S  led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003  Iraqi authorities have declined to give a timeline for recapture of the whole city  but it is likely to last for months  The militants have launched waves of counter attacks against advancing forces  tying them down in lethal urban combat in narrow streets still full of residents  The city s capture is seen as crucial towards dismantling the caliphate  and Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi  believed to have withdrawn to a remote area near the Syrian border  has told his fighters there can be no retreat  Iraqi military estimates put the number of Islamic State fighters in the city at 5 000 to 6 000  Facing them is a 100 000 strong coalition of Iraqi government forces  Kurdish fighters and Shi ite paramilitary units  MILITANTS PROVE RESILIENT Iraqi authorities have not published a casualty toll for the campaign overall   either for security forces  civilians or Islamic State fighters  The warring sides claim to have inflicted thousands of casualties in enemy ranks  Nearly 57 000 people have been displaced because of the fighting  moving from villages and towns around the city to government held areas  according to U N  estimates  The figure does not include the thousands of people rounded up in villages around Mosul and forced to accompany Islamic State fighters to cover their retreat towards the city  In some cases  men of fighting age were separated from those groups and summarily killed  according to residents and rights groups  Human Rights Watch said on Thursday more than 300 former police officers were likely killed last month and buried in a mass grave near the town of Hammam al Alil  south of Mosul   Government forces are still fighting in a dozen of about 50 neighborhoods on the eastern part of Mosul  which is divided by the Tigris River that runs through its center  The militants are dug in among the civilians as a defense tactic to hamper air strikes  moving around the city through tunnels  driving suicide car bombs into advancing troops and hitting them with sniper and mortar fire  The resilience of Islamic State s defenses has forced a greater involvement from the coalition made up mainly of western nations including Britain  France  Italy  Canada and Australia   CANADIANS IN COMBAT Canadian military trainers operating with the Kurdish fighters have clashed several dozen times with Islamic State militants over the last month  defense officials said on Wednesday in Ottawa  On three occasions  the troops were forced to use anti armor rockets to destroy suspected car bombs  said Major General Michael Rouleau  commander of Canada s special forces  The revelation could be awkward for Canada s Liberal government  which promised that the 200 strong training force would not take part in active combat  The United States has also deployed Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters to support Iraqi troops engaged in urban warfare in eastern Mosul  The forces taking part in the fighting have different and sometime conflicting agendas

areas  Iraqi troops engaged the insurgents on Baghdad Street  the main east west route through Falluja  firing rockets at their positions and taking sniper fire and mortar rounds  Counter terrorism forces took control of Falluja hospital  a nest for the militants who set fire to large parts of it before fleeing  and were clearing the eastern al Dhubat neighborhood  a military statement said   It s a long way from done   said Col  Chris Garver  spokesman for the U S  led coalition   There s still a lot of work to be done in terms of clearing all the bad guys out of Falluja and clearing IEDs  improvised explosive devices    Live footage broadcast on state television from outside the hospital showed smoke rising from the hospital and elite commandos celebrating with an Iraqi flag  Falluja  an historic bastion of the Sunni insurgency against U S  forces that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein  a Sunni  in 2003  and the Shi ite led governments that followed  was seen as a launchpad for recent Islamic State bombings in the capital  The International Organization for Migration said on Saturday more than 81 000 people had been displaced by the fighting in Falluja  which had a population about three times that size before the Islamic State seizure in early 2014   Needs  tents  water  supplies   the agency tweeted  After meeting U N  officials about the humanitarian crisis  Prime Minister Abadi ordered emergency measures including setting up mobile clinics  vaccinating children  dispatching water tanks  and supplying electricity within five days  WESTERN DESERT ROUTE Militants tried to slow the troops  advance north of Baiji with mortar attacks that killed two policemen and wounded three soldiers  said army Col  Mohammed Abdulla from Salahuddin operations command  Two suicide car bombs were taken out by air strikes before reaching their targets  though dusty weather was making it difficult to target militants and slowing the advance  military sources said  A spokesman for the U S  led coalition said Apache  NYSE APA  attack helicopters had conducted operations in support of Iraqi forces in the Tigris river valley  where the advance is situated  The government forces were advancing along a desert path west of the main highway linking Baghdad to Mosul which is lined with mines and runs through villages that have a heavy Islamic State presence  said Col  Mohammed al Assadi  an Iraqi army spokesman  Senior officers in the counter terrorism service have told Reuters the forces would not enter Islamic State strongholds in the area  such as Shirqat and Hawija  to avoid getting tied down in secondary battles  The desert route also leads the troops further away from the Makhoul mountains east of Baiji  from which Islamic State has been launching mortars in and around the town for months  Prime Minister Abadi has said Iraqi forces will retake Mosul this year but  in private  many question whether the army  which partially collapsed when Islamic State overran a third of the country in June 2014  will be ready in time   The United States estimates that Islamic State has lost nearly half of the territory it seized in 2014

191599,413115,APA,On ground in Syria  scant evidence of draw down trumpeted by Kremlin,news,"By Jack Stubbs and Maria Tsvetkova MOSCOW  Reuters    A month since Vladimir Putin announced the withdrawal of most Russian forces from Syria  his military contingent there is as strong as ever  with fewer jets but many more attack helicopters able to provide closer combat support to government troops  A Reuters analysis of publicly available tracking data shows no letup in supply missions  the Russian military has maintained regular cargo flights to its Hmeimim airbase in western Syria since Putin s declaration on March 14  Supply runs have also continued via the  Syrian Express  shipping route  Russian engineering troops have been deployed to the ancient city of Palmyra and further information has surfaced about Russian special forces operating in Syria   suggesting the Kremlin is more deeply embroiled in the conflict than it previously acknowledged   There hasn t been a drawdown in any meaningful way   said Nick de Larrinaga  Europe Editor of IHS Jane s Defence Weekly   Russia s military presence in Syria is just as powerful now as it was at the end of 2015   Announcing a drawdown gave Putin some breathing space from Western political pressure over the operation  and an opportunity to carry out maintenance on heavily used jets  But by keeping a strong military force in place  Putin is maintaining his power to influence the situation in Syria by shoring up President Bashar al Assad  Moscow s closest ally in the Middle East  He will also want to secure Russia s role in efforts to broker a resolution to the conflict   a process the Kremlin has used to reassert itself as a global political power after being ostracized by the West over the Ukraine crisis  As recently as Thursday  photos and video footage taken by Turkish bloggers for their online project Bosphorus Naval News showed a Russian Navy landing ship   the Saratov   en route to Russia s Tartous naval facility in the western Syrian province of Latakia loaded with at least ten military trucks  The Saratov is a regular feature on Russia s  Syrian Express  shipping route  which Moscow has used to transport increased supplies and equipment to Syria since the military draw down was announced  The Russian Defence Ministry did not respond to written questions submitted by Reuters  MORE FORMIDABLE FORCE  Russian troops and equipment have also been deployed to Syria by air in recent weeks  An Ilyushin Il 76 cargo plane operated by the Russian Air Force under registration number RA 78830 has flown two supply trips a month to Syria since December  Its last flight to Russia s Latakia airbase was on April 9 10 according to tracking data on website FlightRadar24 com  Able to carry up to 145 people or 50 tonnes of equipment  Il 76 planes have been used to transport heavy vehicles including helicopters to Syria  a Russian Air Force colonel told Reuters  bolstering the number of gunships in the country as Russia s jet force deployment is wound down   We removed some planes and added helicopters  We don t need mass bomb drops during a ceasefire   the colonel said   Helicopters fly lower and can observe the territory better   Russia now has more than 30 helicopters operating in Syria  including a fleet of around eight Mi 28N Night Hunter and Ka 52 Alligator gunships stationed at its Shayrat airbase southeast of Homs city  according to satellite images posted online by IHS Jane s analysts  Separate images show 22 jets and 14 helicopters stationed at the Hmeimim airbase  compared to 29 jets and 7 helicopters seen there in early February  said Justin Bronk  a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute  RUSI     All that s really gone is the fixed wing close air support attack jets   he said   On the rotary side it s a substantially more formidable force than it was    SPECIAL FORCES The Ka 52  known for its unusual double set of top mounted rotor blades and no tail rotor  is the Russian military s official special forces support helicopter and its appearance in Syria is testament to the growing number of Russian ground troops in direct combat roles  western officials say  Russia acknowledged having special forces in Syria for the first time shortly after its military drawdown was announced  saying they were conducting high risk reconnaissance missions and  other special tasks   Since the announcement  Western diplomats say Russia s forces have increasingly targeted Islamic State militants and an offshoot of al Qaeda  Previously Russia focused its strikes on other Assad opponents  including some viewed by the West as moderate   Swapping jets for helicopters illustrates Russia s new military role in the Syrian conflict  engaging directly with fighting on the ground instead of dropping bombs from thousands of feet   Russia s attack helicopters are getting much more into the thick of things than their fixed wing aircraft were previously   said de Larrinaga   We never really saw Russian strike aircraft operating at low level like this before   Both the Ka 52 and Mi 28N  which is broadly equivalent to the U S  Apache  NYSE APA  gunship  were used to provide close air cover to the Syrian army when it secured a major victory by retaking Palmyra from Islamic State militants in March  Bronk said the helicopter deployment was in response to the changing needs of the Syrian army    They are no longer bombarding besieged cities so much  trying to dislodge rebels   he said   Instead they are trying to assist a more mobile  maneuverable style of engagement    
 Because that tactical role or focus of Assad s forces has changed  then the Russian support methodology needs to change along with it  ",2016-04-15,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/on-ground-in-syria,-scant-evidence-of-draw-down-trumpeted-by-kremlin-395767",395767

191621,413137,APA,Victory proves elusive in Saudi king s Yemen war,news,By Angus McDowall  RIYADH  Reuters    In Yemen s humid southern port of Aden  Saudi Arabian soldiers in armored cars patrol streets where jihadists lurk  In Marib  east of the capital Sanaa  they fight alongside tribesmen in the hills  From the skies above  their jets fire down missiles  Saudi military involvement in Yemen would have been unthinkable even a year ago  but with a new leadership and in the crucible of a region wide struggle with Iran  Riyadh abandoned decades of backroom diplomacy for armed adventure  It began six months before Russia s intervention in Syria on the other side of the Iranian Saudi divide  but decades of instability in Yemen  isolated at the southern end of the Gulf peninsula  means it has attracted far less attention  Riyadh is now immersed in a campaign that seems to be hinged on an early surrender by its foes  Its allies are weak and divided and the outcome of the conflict will go a long way towards determining its future role in the Middle East   The military option was the last one for Saudi Arabia and came via a request from the legitimate government and to protect Saudi citizens from ballistic missiles   Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir said last week  Saudi Arabia entered the war citing Iranian interference in its southern neighbor  denied by Tehran  via Houthi militia who swept out of their northern stronghold last year  and because of perceived American disengagement in the region  The Saudis aim to restore the internationally recognized government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi  who fled to Aden before the city was besieged by the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh  triggering the Saudi campaign   Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir said on Saturday he thought the campaign may be nearing its end because of coalition gains and Saleh and the Houthis  willingness to talk  It was the latest in a series of Saudi predictions the intervention would be over quickly  and a Western official said it was optimistic  VANGUARD Outside a dusty Gulf military base on the outskirts of Aden  four armored cars bearing the kingdom s flag paraded around a muddy field during a recent visit by journalists  Soldiers in robes watched television in an air conditioned hut while barefoot Yemeni laborers lugged rocks for a new building  The soldiers are in the vanguard of the foreign policy pursued by King Salman since he took power in January  a policy often described as  assertive   and which hawkish Saudis hope will eventually roll back Iranian influence around the region   It is a policy evident in the transformation of Sharura  a remote outpost of settled Bedouin deep in the desert  into a busy military waystation  with Apache  N APA  and Chinook helicopters on the runway  high pink dunes rising in the distance behind them   Success in Yemen may encourage Salman and his ambitious son  Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman  to step up intervention in other conflicts like Syria  Failure will make it harder to reassemble the coalition of Arab states that has supported it in its southern neighbor   Inside Aden  a thin young man with an assault rifle raised two fingers in a languid V for victory as a Gulf armored vehicle rounded a street corner  a sight familiar to Saudis from news bulletins showing Yemenis welcoming the coalition   Saudi Arabians have been buoyed by the taking of Aden in July  and their relatively low number of casualties   a few dozen soldiers and border guards and a handful of civilians killed in cross border shelling  But the worst fighting may be to come  Even in retaking areas where local people supported the coalition  inexperience has shown  security lapses allowed jihadist suicide bombers to hit three major coalition targets in Aden  and billeting troops too close together led to high casualties when a missile hit a base near Marib   At that airbase  the floor of a large white tent  used as a field hospital after the missile strike killed more than 60 Gulf soldiers  was still littered with medical debris including latex gloves and blood stained plasma bags weeks after the blast   The only soldiers Reuters saw there in a visit to Yemen last month arranged by the Saudi armed forces were Yemeni  Gulf forces remained in Marib  but had been dispersed to separate camps for their own safety  a Saudi officer said   The coalition has not pushed far into highland areas where the Houthis enjoy greatest support  and where the terrain favors those holding it  Artillery fire could be heard in Marib from the hills to the west  areas vital to the recapture of the capital Sanaa  Yemen s rugged highland terrain still provides cover for constant Houthi attacks on Saudi frontier positions and distant blasts were also audible to Reuters on separate trips to the border  Diplomats say Riyadh appears to hope the military pressure  which has tacit support from the U S  France and Britain  will force the Houthis and Saleh to sue for peace without the coalition and its local allies having to reach the capital  The war has already cost billions of dollars  It would be hard to sustain even if Riyadh s oil revenues were not hit by stagnant crude prices and would skyrocket with any escalation  So far  despite the presence of several thousand Saudi and Emirati troops in Yemen at times during the war  their use of more ground troops seems unlikely  The arrival of Sudanese troops in Aden this month underlined Riyadh s desire to keep a light footprint   That policy has also meant a reliance on local fighters  but they are often untrained and engaged in the war not because of their support for Hadi  but for tribal or religious reasons  In Aden  the only Yemeni flag on obvious display in the city was in the temporary seat of government at the Qasr Hotel  days before it was hit by a jihadist suicide bomb  Hundreds of other flags represented a longstanding southern separatist movement  In Marib  Sunni Muslim fighters used virulently sectarian language to describe the Shi ite Houthis  Even Hadi s government  based in the fraying splendor of Riyadh s 1970s Guest Palace since March  is divided between partisans of the president and those of his vice president  Khaled al Bahah   Meanwhile  outside Saudi Arabia  the ghastly human toll of the conflict  from a naval blockade that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine  and civilian deaths blamed by local people on coalition bombing  has made Riyadh s Western allies queasy   So far  the United Nations estimates at least 2 400 civilians have been killed  Many more are destitute  on a street in Aden with buildings punctured with shell holes  a woman in a black robe sat begging  a baby in a

191629,413145,APA,Coalition poised to retake capital  but Yemen risks grow,news,"By Mohammed Ghobari and Angus McDowall
SANAA RIYADH  Reuters    Weeks after seizing Yemen s southern port  Aden  members of a Saudi led military coalition and the local fighters it supports say they are poised to oust Iranian allied Houthi forces from the capital Sanaa 
But al Qaeda militants appear to be using the coalition s gains against the Houthis in the south to entrench their position  as fractures start to show between local groups of fighters with the departure of their common enemy 
The prospect of returning exiled President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi remains distant  five months after an advance on his Aden bolthole by the Houthis  who overran the capital a year ago from their northern base  triggered the Saudi led intervention 
At stake is not just who will rule Yemen  which regional power will hold sway and whether its persistent jihadist threat can be ended  but its future as a single state after centuries of tribal disputes and regional divisions 
Saudi Arabia and its allies want to maintain the state created in 1990 by the merger of the old north and south Yemen  say informed diplomats  but as anger grows over the humanitarian cost  the possibility of division appears to be growing 
 In the absence of a political settlement the battle for Sanaa will be long  brutal  and deadly with no obvious winner  A failure to retake Sanaa by Hadi s camp is likely to lead to a de facto partition of Yemen   said Ibrahim Fraihat  senior political analyst at Brookings Doha Centre 
Such a settlement still looks elusive  with each side attempting to escalate the fighting since the fall of Aden 
In the north  the Houthis have pounded the Saudi border  determined to ensure coalition victories and continued airstrikes come at a cost  In southern Taiz  fierce fighting  and the bombardment of civilians  continues 
Attention has increasingly turned to Marib  a dry tribal region across the arid hills east of Sanaa  where Saudi linked media and local sources report a build up of coalition backed forces preparing for a concerted thrust toward Yemen s capital 
GULF GROUND ROLE
The dozens of Emirati troops guarding Aden s smashed up airport and their helicopters  tanks and armored cars lined up on the apron during a recent Reuters visit to the city were ample evidence of the ground role played by Gulf states 
It was the direct involvement of Emirati ground forces  alongside Yemeni troops trained in Saudi Arabia and equipped with sophisticated heavy weapons that allowed the coalition to break months of stalemate to take Aden  informed diplomats say 
The Arab states say the Houthis are a proxy for Iran  an accusation the movement denies  countering that its advance is a revolution against Western backed officials it says are corrupt  as well as al Qaeda militants  It has joined up with military allies of Yemen s longtime ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh  who was ousted by Arab Spring unrest in 2012 
The further coalition forces move beyond areas where local support is high  the harder it will be 
The most obvious launchpad for a new coalition military push is Marib  where local tribes have for months fought back and forth battles against the Houthis and Saleh s forces  and beyond which lies a clear  safe supply route to Saudi Arabia 
Leaders of the exiled government s army have been quoted in Saudi press saying they are building up forces in the province and are ready for a push on Sanaa next month 
A local official told Reuters 130 armored vehicles  1 000 Yemeni troops trained in Saudi Arabia and military experts from the kingdom and the UAE had arrived in recent days along with engineers to allow its airstrip to import materiel 
A renewed barrage of attacks on Saudi border positions  including the reported launch of a Scud missile at the kingdom on Tuesday  showed the Houthis and Saleh are determined to make Gulf involvement in the conflict hurt 
On Friday a Saudi Apache  NYSE APA  helicopter came down on the border  killing both pilots  while on Monday Houthi shells killed Major General Abdulrahman al Shahrani  commander of the 18th Brigade  and the kingdom s highest ranking casualty of the conflict 
MILITANTS AND FRACTURED ALLIANCES
While the Emirati soldiers did sentry duty by Aden s runway or rested in an upstairs terminal lounge  outside the front entrance stood slight young men with assault rifles slung over their shoulders and curling hair falling across bearded faces 
Many of these un uniformed fighters  wearing flip flops and Yemeni futeh sarongs  took up arms when the Houthis reached their city  abandoning daily life as their neighborhoods were engulfed by street fighting 
But in Yemen s multi sided conflict  it was never clear how many of these fighters had loyalties beyond those to their immediate neighborhood  whether to Hadi  to a southern separatist movement or to other political or militant groups 
While coalition forces protect key facilities in Aden  basic security in many areas of the city has collapsed  as a YouTube video showing the mob execution of a suspected Houthi collaborator demonstrated 
More alarming still for Hadi and the coalition  dozens of armed men paraded through Aden s central Tawahi district on Saturday  raising al Qaeda flags  days after a series of bombs exploded outside government offices in the city  killing four 
Hamza al Zinjibari  a local al Qaeda leader  earlier this month said in a video message that most of the local  coalition backed fighters against the Houthis were in fact members of the militant group  shaping the jihad  after military leaders fled 
Hadi s government insists the militant group played no role in the defense of Aden from the Houthis and that its apparent display of strength in the city last week was in fact the work of Saleh supporters sowing instability after losing the city 
A local official in Aden said on Wednesday that Gulf forces were training 2 000 local fighters including separatists  Hadi loyalists and members of Islamist parties to take over security in the city temporarily 
That strange mix of competing groups  including some who only a year ago would have been sworn enemies  shows the fragility of the local forces upon which the coalition plans depend ",2015-08-27,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/coalition-poised-to-retake-capital,-but-yemen-risks-grow-357969",357969
191630,413146,APA,Exclusive  In clash with pope s climate call  U S  Church leases drilling rights,news,"By Richard Valdmanis BOSTON  Reuters    Casting the fight against climate change as an urgent moral duty  Pope Francis in June urged the world to phase out highly polluting fossil fuels  Yet in the heart of U S  oil country several dioceses and other Catholic institutions are leasing out drilling rights to oil and gas companies to bolster their finances  Reuters has found  And in one archdiocese    Oklahoma City    Church officials have signed three new oil and gas leases since Francis s missive on the environment  leasing documents show  On Francis  first visit to the United States this week  the business dealings suggest that some leaders of the U S  Catholic Church are practicing a different approach to the environment than the pontiff is preaching  Catholic institutions are not forbidden from dealing with or investing in the energy industry  The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops   USCCB  guidelines on ethical investing warn Catholics and Catholic institutions against investing in companies related to abortion  contraception  pornography  tobacco  and war  but do not suggest avoiding energy stocks  and do not address the ownership of energy production interests  A Reuters review of county documents found 235 oil and gas leasing deals signed by Catholic Church authorities in Texas and Oklahoma with energy and land firms since 2010  covering 56 counties across the two states  None of the Texas leases in the review were signed after the pope s encyclical  Those two states have been at the forefront of a boom in U S  energy production in recent years  often through the controversial hydraulic fracturing production method  known as fracking   It was not clear whether production on the Church leases was through fracking   a process that involves injecting sand  water and chemicals underground to crack open rock formations    or more conventional drilling methods   The Church authorities receive a royalty ranging from 15 to 25 percent of the value of what is taken out of the ground  according to the leases  which are public documents filed with county clerk offices  Reuters  search method did not capture leases signed before 2010 but which may still be in force   Click here for a graphic     There may be some kind of inconsistency here between what the pope has said and what the Church is doing in U S  oil and gas country   said Mickey Thompson  a consultant and former director of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association  He added that since the Church often acquires its mineral rights through donations from parishioners  there could be  legal or fiduciary reasons  it has sought to lease them out  It was unclear if that was the case with the leases signed by Church institutions in Texas and Oklahoma  including the three leases signed in Oklahoma since June  A USCCB official and a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma City archdiocese both declined to comment   The Vatican does not have direct power over investment decisions taken by dioceses in the United States  a responsibility reserved for their bishops  Members of the U S  Catholic hierarchy have fallen out of line with papal administrations before  Last year  for example  U S  Cardinal Raymond Burke was moved out of a senior post in the Vatican after clashing with Francis  more liberal views on homosexuality and Catholic re marriage  MORAL DISSONANCE A Reuters examination of financial disclosures by U S  Catholic institutions in August found that they have millions of dollars invested in energy companies  from hydraulic fracturing to oil sands producers  One U S  archdiocese  Chicago  told Reuters it planned to review its energy shareholdings in light of the pope s June message  But the Church s direct links to the fossil fuels industry through the Oklahoma and Texas lease deals highlight a potentially deeper moral dissonance in the wake of the pope s unambiguous attack on human caused climate change  Francis makes his first visit to the United States from Tuesday through Sept  27 with stops in Washington  New York and Philadelphia  In Texas  dioceses that granted oil leases in recent years included Dallas  Fort Worth  Austin  and San Antonio   Pat Svacina  a spokesman for the Diocese of Forth Worth  said the diocese received  31 661 from its leases in fiscal year 2015  He declined to say whether the diocese was considering reviewing its oil and gas leasing program in light of the pope s encyclical   The way the leases are written it is very difficult to cancel a lease that is in production   Svacina said   The Diocese always reviews the viability and desirability of renewing a lease at the conclusion of a current lease   he added  without elaborating  In Oklahoma  about one quarter of the roughly 165 Church lease deals signed since 2010 were granted by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City  with most of the rest granted by the Catholic Foundation of Oklahoma and the St  Gregory s Catholic University of Oklahoma  DONATED RIGHTS Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S  Coakley signed the most recent deal on Sept  3  giving privately held oil company Comanche Resources rights to operate on 160 acres in Major County in exchange for 18 75 percent of the value of the oil and gas produced   The two year extendable lease also permits Comanche to lay pipes  build storage tanks  power stations  and other installations   Click here to see the lease      Coakley signed similar deals with energy companies Continental Resources and Lance Ruffell Oil in July and August  with royalties of 25 and 20 percent respectively   A spokeswoman for the archdiocese declined to comment  and efforts to reach Coakley were not successful  The spokeswoman also declined comment on behalf of the Catholic Foundation  where Coakley serves as chairman   An official at St  Gregory s said the university had been given significant mineral rights by donors  adding that the royalties collected had averaged about  405 000 over the past three years  or 3 7 percent of revenue  The official asked not to be identified   While the Church provides little data on its finances  information from other Catholic institutions in Oklahoma and Texas showed oil and gas royalties yielded a small portion of overall revenue in recent years  partly reflecting a slide in energy prices  A review of audited statements issued by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City between 2010 and 2013 showed that the oil and gas royalties made up 2 percent of total revenue  or  1 6 million  over that period  That share peaked in 2012 at 5 percent  or  704 399  according to the audited statements  The other Oklahoma institutions did not provide data  A spokesman for the Archdiocese of San Antonio  Jordan McMurrough  said the archdiocese had been collecting small energy royalties on its mineral rights since the 1950s  but that they currently make up less than 1 percent of revenue   The archdiocese currently does not plan changes to its long standing practice of granting oil and gas leases   he said  adding that Archbishop Gustavo Garc a Siller  is well aware of and deeply respects  Pope Francis  encyclical  He said one third of the archdiocese s mineral rights were donated  with the rest  by acquisition for church purposes over the years   Officials at the other dioceses in Texas did not respond to requests for comment   Other companies that have signed energy leasing deals with the Church in recent years include  Apache Corp   NYSE APA   Cabot  Chesapeake   Devon Energy   NYSE DVN   and Range Resources  NYSE RRC   All have been active in a fracking boom over the past several years   A spokeswoman for Apache Corp confirmed the company has  a very limited  number of leases with the Church  but declined to comment further  The other firms did not respond to requests for comment   Fracking has led to a surge in U S  production by making new reserves available to the industry  and contributed to the slump in world energy prices  But the drilling boom has raised worries about pollution  climate change  and potentially damaging earthquakes from wastewater injection    fears that the oil industry says are overblown

and Apache  NYSE APA  helicopters strafed the region  The insurgency  which is seeking to topple the Cairo government  has intensified since 2013  when then army chief Abdel Fattah al Sisi removed President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests against his rule  Sisi  who regards the Brotherhood as a threat to national security  has since overseen a harsh crackdown on Islamists  The courts have sentenced hundreds of alleged Brotherhood supporters to death in recent months  Mursi himself  and other senior Brotherhood figures  also face the death penalty   Sisi s government does not distinguish between the now outlawed Brotherhood   which says it is committed to peaceful activism   and other militants  MILITANTS PLANT BOMBS The exact breakdown of identities of those killed was not immediately clear  Security sources said at least 36 people  including soldiers  policemen and civilians were killed and 38 militants were also killed  Doctor Osama el Sayed of El Arish General Hospital in the provincial capital said 30 bodies had been brought in   some of whom were wearing army fatigues   Security sources said militants had surrounded a police station in Sheikh Zuweid and had planted bombs around it to prevent forces from leaving  The militants also planted bombs along a road between Sheikh Zuweid and al Zuhour army camp to prevent the movement of any army supplies or reinforcements  They also seized two armored vehicles  weapons and ammunition  the sources said   We are not allowed to leave our homes  Clashes are ongoing  A short while ago I saw five Landcruisers with masked gunmen waving black flags   said Suleiman al Sayed  a 49 year old Sheikh Zuweid resident  Ambulance medic Yousef Abdelsalam said he was at the entrance to Sheikh Zuweid but could not enter because of warnings that the road was rigged with bombs  Witnesses and security sources also reported hearing two explosions in the nearby town of Rafah  which borders Gaza  The sources said all roads leading to Rafah and Sheikh Zuweid were shut down and residents were staying in their homes   Sinai Province said in Wednesday s statement that it had attacked more than 15 security sites and carried out three suicide bombings   It is a sharp reminder that despite the intensive counter terrorism military campaign in the Sinai over the past 6 months  the IS ranks are not decreasing   if anything they are increasing in numbers as well as sophistication  training and daring   Aimen Dean  a former al Qaeda insider who now runs a Gulf based security consultancy  said in a note  In Cairo  security forces stormed an apartment in a western suburb and killed nine men whom they said were armed  security sources said  The sources said authorities had received information the group was planning to carry out an attack  Among those dead was Nasser al Hafi  a prominent lawyer for the Muslim Brotherhood and a former lawmaker  STUBBORN INSURGENCY Islamic State had urged its followers to escalate attacks during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan which started in mid June  though it did not specify Egypt as a target  In April  the army extended by three months a state of emergency imposed in parts of Sinai  The army has taken several measures to crush the insurgency  Besides bombardments in the region  they have destroyed tunnels into the Palestinian ruled Gaza Strip and created a security buffer zone in northern Sinai  The army is also digging a trench along the border with Gaza in an effort to prevent smuggling  Under the terms of Egypt s 1979 peace accord with Israel  the Sinai is largely demilitarized  But Israel has regularly agreed to Egypt bringing in reinforcements to tackle the Sinai insurgency  and one Israeli official signaled there could be further such deployments following Wednesday s attacks    This incident is a game changer   an official told Reuters on condition of anonymity

191650,413166,APA,Australia Oil Find Could Ignite Drilling Boom Off Country s Northwest Coast,news,"By    An oil boom could be on tap for Australia s northwest coast  U S  energy firm Apache Corp  NYSE APA says it has made what might be Australia s largest oil discovery in decades  in a region that drillers had previously abandoned after coming up empty handed 
The oil field off of Western Australia s Canning Basin potentially holds up to 300 million barrels of oil  according to Apache  though only a slice of those deposits would be recoverable  The finding was made by the Phoenix South 1 well  which was initially exploring for gas when it stumbled upon the vast oil patch 
The country needs new oil sources to replace its quickly diminishing reserves from existing fields  the Wall Street Journal noted  Australia oil production in 2013 dropped by 17 percent to 416 000   a four decade low   as conventional fields dried up  according to BP PLC NYSE BP 
The possible economic gains from the find come at a good time for Western Australia  which has recently suffered from the bursting of its iron ore export bubble  According to the Sydney Morning Herald benchmark iron ore prices are 31 percent off their January 1 level  and that decline has been aggravated by an almost 5 percent rise in the local currency this year 
Iron ore  one of the world s most fundamental commodities  sold off sharply beginning in 2013 after several months of rising prices prompted producers to boost output at the same time that demand in China waned 
Furthermore  the IBTimes UK reported in June that staff at one of the world s largest mining groups was bracing themselves for around 3 000 job cuts as BHP Billiton is pegged to slash headcount to cut costs in its iron ore business  
The nation s coal industry uhas also taken a big hit  losing more than 12 000 jobs since 2012  amid rising competition and volatile commodities prices 
Apache s drilling results so far  point to a commercial discovery   Thomas Voytovich  a senior executive at the firm s international arm  told reporters   If these results are borne out by further appraisal drilling  Phoenix South may represent a new oil province for Australia  

Boosting the company s optimism is the oil s high grade  light  quality  which is easier to produce than heavier blends and attracts premium prices  analysts said  according to the Sydney Morning Herald 
Peter Strachan  a principal at StockAnalysis  told the paper that that the discovery could likely hold up to 60 million barrels of recoverable oil  He estimated the field would cost about  1 billion to develop using a floating production vessel  which could potentially produce up to 25 000 barrels of oil per day 
The full significance of the Phoenix South discovery  however  likely won t be known for decades  Simon Andrew  an energy analyst at Perth based broker Hartleys  told the WSJ ",2014-08-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/australia-oil-find-could-ignite-drilling-boom-off-country's-northwest-coast-304018,304018

potential supply disruptions from an expected active hurricane
season  	
 Top Republicans and Democrats worked behind the scenes on a
compromise to avert the first default by the U S  in its
history  U S  stocks suffered their worst day in eight weeks
partly because of the stalemate while gold stayed near its

uncertainty prompted ANZ to trim its third quarter forecast for

191661,413177,APA,The Market Timing Secrets No One Talks About   February 07  2020,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Indeed  even among those investors who don t try to consistently time the markets  many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically  It s at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Oils Energy stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  Apache Corporation  NYSE APA   Antero Resources Corporation  AR   Alliance Resource Partners  L P   ARLP   Azure Power Global Ltd   AZRE   Abraxas Petroleum Corporation  AXAS 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose lose situation 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

191676,413192,APA,Earnings Preview  Apache  APA  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Apache  APA  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and natural gas producer is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  146  
Revenues are expected to be  1 43 billion  down 27 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 158 59  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apache 
For Apache  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Apache will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Apache would post earnings of  0 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 11  delivering a surprise of  175  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Apache doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-apache-apa-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200476867,200476867

What s Next for Apache 
While Apache has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Apache was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

191680,413196,APA,Apache  APA  Reports Wider Q3 Loss On Lower Oil Realizations,opinion,U S  energy firm Apache Corporation   NYSE APA   reported third quarter 2019 loss per share   excluding one time items   of 29 cents  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents  In the year ago period  the company reported adjusted profit of 63 cents  The underperformance stems from lower oil price realizations Revenues of  1 5 billion were 25 5  lower than the third quarter 2018 sales of  2 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 4 billion due to higher than expected production  Precisely  the Houston  TX based upstream explorer s output of 450 644 oil equivalent barrels per day  BOE d  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 441 000 BOE d During the earnings release  the company further informed that it has started a strategic operational reorganization that is expected to result in savings of at least  150 million  The initiative is to be completed by Mar 31  2020 Apache Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Production   Selling PricesProduction of oil and natural gas averaged 450 644 BOE d   comprising 67  liquids   down 5 4  from a year ago due to the impact of asset sales The U S  output  accounting for 59  of the total  fell 2 4  year over year to 265 910 BOE d  while the company s international operations decreased 9 4  to 184 734 BOE d

company s Permian Basin acreage  average production volumes improved to 254 432 BOE d from 222 259 in the third quarter of 2018  The results were aided by operational progress  somewhat offset by unscheduled downtime and delays in completion schedule The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was  58 60 per barrel  15 2  lower than the year ago realization and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  63  The average realized natural gas price also declined to  1 66 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf  from  2 56 in the year ago period but was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 49 Costs  Financial PositionApache s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled  350 million  down 8 4  from the year ago quarter  Moreover  total operating expenses fell 7 2  from the corresponding period of 2018 to  1 5 billion  Apart from a tight leash on lease operating expenses  this was mainly on account of lower financing costs  decline in exploration expenses and fall in outlays related to gathering  processing and transmission  which more than offset higher costs related to asset impairment During the quarter under review  Apache generated  635 million of cash from operating activities  while shelling out  590 million on capital expenditures for positive free cash flow As of Sep 30  the oil giant had approximately  163 million in cash and cash equivalents  Apache had long term debt of  8 2 billion  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 56 4  GuidanceApache reiterated its guidance for 2019 capital spending at  2 4 billion  For 2020  the expects its upstream capital outlay to be around 10 20  below this year s spending However  the company is struggling with completion schedule delays in the Permian Basin as well as natural gas production from the Alpine High play considering the extremely low prices of the commodity prevailing at the Waha hub in West Texas  In fact  Apache was forced to lower volumes from the play earlier in the year  which it returned during August and September Consequently  the company now expects fourth quarter Permian Basin crude production to be around 100 000 BOE d  For Alpine High specifically  Apache has lowered its production guidance by 5  from the previous projection  This takes into account Apache s reduced drilling activity in the region and the deferment of some fourth quarter completions into

Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose lose situation 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

191689,413205,APA,GCP Student Living  Continuing To Benefit From Strong Fundamentals,opinion,"GCP Student Living PLC   LON DIGS  is continuing to benefit from strong supply demand fundamentals in the markets in which it operates  primarily in and around London  It is maintaining full occupancy  rents continue to grow ahead of inflation and profitability is showing the benefits of scale  Dividends are growing and cover building as new assets come on stream  and DIGS is well on track for full cover on a fully developed and let basis  Investor sentiment towards the sector is positive and the new London Plan appears to be adding to the scarcity value of DIGS s London assets 




Strong student and investor demand in London
Positively for DIGS  with 87  of its assets in and around London  international student applications continue to grow   8 9  for 2019 20  and despite Brexit  EU applications also show slight growth  Government plans to boost international student numbers and income are also positive  The operational assets are again fully occupied for 2019 20  with like for like rental growth of 4 4   2018 19  3 5    In the investment market  recent transactions indicate continuing strong investor interest in London assets in particular and the new London Plan seems likely to further reduce the supply of new London assets and increase the scarcity value of existing assets 
15 4  NAV total return in FY19
As DIGS had previously reported  EPRA NAV per share increased by 11  to 165 5p in FY19 and  including reinvestment of dividends paid  the NAV total return was 15 4   Based on the share price  shareholder total return was 14 8  and the annualised return since IPO is now 12 9   Rental income growth of 24  included a nine month contribution from Scape Bloomsbury  above inflation rental growth  and continued full occupancy  The operating margin increased to c 59  from c 57  and adjusted EPS grew c 30  to 5 23p  DPS declared increased 3 4  to 6 15p and was 85  covered by adjusted earnings  Property valuations were lifted by rental growth  operational progress  full occupancy and a further tightening of market yields  The current year will benefit from a full contribution from Scape Bloomsbury and a first time contribution from Circus Street  Brighton 
Positive fundamentals support growth and returns
Growing dividends are supported by continuing strong fundamentals in DIGS s chosen markets and should be covered by adjusted earnings on a fully operational basis  The shares trade at a small discount to NAV  despite share price and NAV returns since the IPO continuing to be well above the 8 10  target  and good potential for further income and capital growth 




London focused student accommodation
DIGS is a specialist UK REIT investing in student residential assets and differentiated by a focus on assets in and around London  87  by value at 30 June 2019  FY19   The shares have been listed since May 2013 and the company has a premium listing on the FCA s Official List  trading on the Premium segment of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange  The investment objective is to provide shareholders with attractive total returns in the longer term through regular  sustainable dividends with inflation linked characteristics and the potential for modest capital appreciation  DPS has increased steadily since IPO and the annualised EPRA NAV total return from IPO to end FY19  with dividends reinvested  has been 13 9   15 4  in FY19   Based on the share price performance over the same period with dividends reinvested  the annualised shareholder total return has been 12 9   14 8  in FY19  
The student housing sector continues to attract investor interest for its favourable risk adjusted yields  good levels of rental growth and less exposure to the economic led cycles that affect traditional commercial property sectors such as offices  industrial and retail property  DIGS is differentiated by a focus on properties that are located primarily in or around London and invests in other markets with similar supply demand characteristics  eg Brighton   where growing student numbers significantly outstrip the supply of student accommodation  London continues to see increasing numbers of international and post graduate students  driving demand for purpose built student accommodation  PBSA   while planning restrictions and competing demands limit supply  The investment manager targets high specification  modern  purpose built accommodation with proximity to a suitable higher education institution and or a major transport hub  Such properties may be more likely to both appeal to students today and offer longevity of income potential to support long term value creation  even if the current yields may be lower 
At end FY19  the portfolio comprised the 11 assets shown at the bottom of Exhibit 1  providing c 4 100 beds  of which c 3 500 will be operational and fully let for the 2019 20 academic year  The portfolio was externally valued at  921 6m  before lease incentive adjustments   reflecting a net initial yield  NIY  of 4 54  




Management and governance
Fully independent board
DIGS has a fully independent non executive board that is responsible for the effective stewardship of the company s affairs  including corporate strategy  corporate governance  risk assessment and overall investment policy  DIGS has been chaired since IPO by Robert Peto  who has extensive corporate  property sector and board experience  He will retire from the board at the AGM to be held late in 2020 and will be replaced by David Hunter  who joined the board in May 2019  David Hunter is a qualified chartered surveyor and a professional strategic adviser focused principally on UK and international real estate  He is on the board of listed and unlisted companies in the UK and overseas  including as chairman of Custodian REIT and ICG Longbow  the real estate division of Intermediate Capital Group   senior independent director of Yatra Capital  a director of Saffron India Real Estate Fund and is an adviser to French family office  Quilvest 
The other four independent non executive directors and their dates of appointment are Malcolm Naish  2013  IPO   Marlene Wood  March 2015  and Gillian Day  February 2018   Full board biographies may be found on the company s website 
DIGS has an unlimited life  although the company s articles require regular continuation votes to be put to shareholders  The first vote was held in November 2018 and  given DIGS s outperformance of the return targets that were set at IPO and the continuing strong fundamentals of the markets in which it operates  shareholders overwhelmingly supported continuation  Future votes are at three yearly intervals  with the next to be held at the AGM in 2021 
Investment manager   Gravis
DIGS has appointed Gravis to provide day to day investment management services  Gravis was established in 2008 and is privately owned by its directors and founding members  At 30 June 2019 it was managing  2 7bn in assets  including two other listed closed end vehicles  Nick Barker from Gravis is the fund manager with day to day responsibility for the provision of investment advice to DIGS  He is a qualified surveyor who joined Gravis in 2015 after eight years with Schroder Real Estate Management  where he was head of alternatives for the real estate business and a member of the fund management team  Investment management fees are accrued daily and paid quarterly in arrears at 1  of NAV from which Gravis is responsible for the asset management fees of 0 25  of NAV 
Asset and facilities management   predominantly Scape
Scape Student Living  Scape  is the principal asset and facilities manager for DIGS  in respect of all the Scape branded assets as well as The Pad and Podium  Collegiate provides asset and facilities management for the Water Lane Apartments in Bristol  As a developer and manager  Scape has extensive expertise in the construction  design and operation of student accommodation and its branding proposition is to provide high quality but affordable student accommodation with a modern design  The first Scape building was launched in London s Mile End in 2012 and today it designs  builds and operates buildings for students across the globe  with 18 000 beds in operation or under development  Scape manages the DIGS facilities while the actual asset management costs  such as on site staff  utilities  etc  are paid directly by DIGS  a structure that is both operationally and tax efficient  avoiding additional non deductible VAT expenses that may otherwise arise  The Scape fees  0 25  of NAV pa  are paid by Gravis out of its  1   fee entitlement  DIGS has benefitted from the close relationship between Scape and Gravis  whose owners have a 50  interest in Scape  through preferential access to pipeline assets 
FY19  Strong income growth and increased DPS cover
The portfolio continued to perform well in FY19  benefiting from the supply demand imbalances for high quality  modern student facilities in those locations targeted by the company  The assets under development are on track to deliver further income growth and the company continues to identify attractive opportunities for further investment 
Rental income grew strongly  24 1    benefiting from new assets becoming operational  above inflation rental growth and continued full occupancy  Profitability is also showing the benefit of scale economies  with adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS up 37 5  and 30 5  respectively  Increased dividends  up 3 4  in the year  have been set and investment decisions made based on the investment manager s expectation that they will be covered by earnings on a fully developed and let basis  With dividends covered 85  by adjusted earnings  we estimate cover of 89  in H219   the company is well on track to achieving this  EPRA  and IFRS  NAV per share increased by 11 0  during the year to 165 52p  Including the reinvestment of dividends paid during the period  the NAV total return was 15 4  




The key financial highlights from the FY19 results were 
The 24 1  growth in rental income to  44 4m was driven by a first time  c nine month  contribution from Scape Bloomsbury  which opened for the 2018 19 academic year following refurbishment  and average 3 5  rental growth across the portfolio  The portfolio was again fully occupied for the 2018 19 academic year 
The scale benefits of the growing portfolio can be seen in both increased profits and enhanced profitability  Gross profit increased by 25 9  to  35 0m with the gross margin increasing slightly to 78 9   At 18 5   the growth in administrative costs  which comprise fund running costs  including the investment manager s fee and other third party service provider costs  was lower than the growth in gross profit  As a result  the operating margin increased to 59 1   FY18  57 0   and operating profit before property valuation movements increased by 28 6  to  26 2m 
The increase in net finance expense was just 5 8   reflecting a modest increase in debt during the year as the company began to use its re drawable debt facility  Property investment during the year was additionally funded out of cash resources  which included  42 3m net proceeds from new equity issuance 
The carried value of the investment portfolio  adjusted for lease incentives on the small amount of commercial space attached to the portfolio  has increased to  919 2m  including  59 6m investment spending on the Circus Street  Brighton and Scape Brighton forward funded assets and a net fair value movement of  73 9m  Revaluation movements were driven by rental growth  operational progress and yield compression  with the latter given evidential support by a number of important market transactions in and around London  The end FY19 blended net initial yield on the DIGS portfolio was 4 54  compared with 5 04  at end FY18 and 4 74  at H119 
Including the revaluation gains  IFRS earnings increased by 52  compared with FY18  to  92 8m  Adjusted earnings  which excludes the valuation gain  adjusts for other one off items  and includes licence fees on forward funding developments  increased by 37 5  to  21 2m  Adjusted EPS increased 30 5  to 5 23p 
Aggregate dividends declared for the year were 6 15p  an increase of 3 4  and  as the company had previously guided  dividend cover increased strongly  Adjusted earnings covered DPS by 85  in the year compared with 67  in FY18 and on a fully operational and let basis  DIGS continues to expect dividends paid to be fully covered by earnings 
Post the year end the company s operational portfolio achieved full occupancy with respect to the 2019 20 academic year  with like for like growth in student rents of 4 4  
Investment strategy and portfolio update
The company s property portfolio consists of high quality  modern  purpose built accommodation primarily in and around London  Exhibit 1   Some of the assets include a relatively small amount of complementary commercial space  contributing c 6  of the FY19 gross rental income  In London  a shortage of suitable accommodation  tight constraints on new supply and growing demand  particularly from overseas students  is a supportive backdrop to occupancy and rent levels  providing visibility over income  These same supply constraints can also present a challenge to asset growth  but the relationship with Scape has been particularly effective in helping DIGS access attractive properties that meet its investment criteria and steadily grow its portfolio  The London Plan  expected to be introduced later this year  is likely to create new barriers to the development of such properties and increase the investment attraction of existing assets 
Most of DIGS  student accommodation is directly let to students from a broad range of nationalities  124  attending a diverse group of higher education institutions  80   Reflecting the London focus of the portfolio and the popularity of London with international students  63  of rooms are let to non EU international students  14  to EU students and 23  to UK students  Of these  70  are undergraduates and 30  are postgraduates 
Scape Bloomsbury delivered ahead of schedule
Scape Bloomsbury  providing 432 beds in the heart of central London  was completed ahead of schedule  in time for the 2018 19 academic year  DIGS had initially expected to open the first five floors in September and the top three in December but was able to fully open in September with higher than budgeted overall initial occupancy  Annualised rental income is c  9m and Scape Bloomsbury contributed for around nine months in FY19  with a further income uplift to come through in FY20 from a full year contribution and a step up to full occupancy  The planning consent for Scape Bloomsbury permits occupation by non students outside of the academic year that  given its prime location  is likely to prove a useful additional source of revenue  It was valued at  189 6m at end FY19  reflecting a net initial yield of 4 10   and contributed significantly   18 7m  to the FY19 property revaluation surplus 
Brighton forward funding assets on track
In May 2019  DIGS acquired Scape Brighton  its second asset in Brighton  having entered into a conditional contract to acquire and forward fund the asset in July 2018  Like London  Brighton is a difficult market in which to acquire direct let  purpose built student accommodation owing to tight land supply and strict planning constraints  Scape Brighton is situated on the University of Brighton s main campus and on completion  expected in time for the 2020 21 academic year  will provide 555 beds and extensive communal areas  with c 1 500sqft of retail space  The planning consent allows for the property to be available to accommodate students from any of Brighton s higher education institutions in addition to any language school students during the summer period  During the construction phase  DIGS will benefit from licensing fees in respect of the development funding extended  providing a 5 5  coupon pa and included in adjusted earnings 
Construction work on the c 450 bed  forward funded office project at Circus Street in central Brighton is proceeding in line with expectations and nearing completion in time for the 2019 20 academic year  Unlike most of DIGS assets  Circus Street is let on a 21 year  RPI linked lease to Kaplan at an initial rent of  2 9m  The development includes a standalone  speculatively developed Grade A office building  which is generating strong interest from potential occupiers and investors given a tight Brighton market  It will be retained or sold and the capital recycled when completed and stabilised  depending on the nature of the tenant  During the construction phase  licencing fee income  at a rate of 5 5  pa of the funding extended  has been recognised in adjusted income 
Further growth in the pipeline
DIGS also benefits from a future contractual arrangement to acquire Scape Canalside  a 412 bed  new build asset located adjacent to Queen Mary University of London  a strong Russell Group higher education institution  and is considering the optimum way to finance its acquisition  The asset is a high specification  purpose built private student accommodation residence  the design of which and its market positioning are complementary to the existing 588 bed Scape Mile End  formerly Scape East  that is in the same locality  Scape Canalside achieved practical completion in July 2019 and has been fully let for the 2019 20 academic year  Through its investment manager  DIGS has secured attractive pricing through the forward purchase agreement  which the company expects will result in an uplift in the valuation post purchase  expected to coincide with the start of the academic year  The actual acquisition price will be determined by independent valuation  but the company has said this is likely to be in excess of  90m 
Additionally  the company has entered into a conditional forward purchase agreement to acquire a well situated  high specification  purpose built asset with 403 beds in the same locality as its 141 bed Scape Guildford asset  Guildford is home to the University of Surrey  a UK top 20 university   the University of Law and the Academy of Contemporary Music  contributing to an undersupply of private student residential accommodation and full occupation at Scape Surrey in each year since its acquisition in 2015  DIGS has provided no financial details at this stage  The property is expected to complete in time for the 2020 21 academic year 
Continuing above inflation rental growth
In terms of income returns  DIGS targets regular sustainable dividends with inflation linked characteristics  A relatively small proportion of rental income is contractually directly linked to RPI  Circus Street at completion will be an exception   so the inflation linked characteristic relies on the selection of suitable assets and locations with favourable demand supply dynamics that have the potential to deliver continuing rental growth  Exhibit 5 shows that DIGS has been able to sustain rental growth in excess of both RPI and the market over several years  achieving average like for like rental growth of 3 5  in the academic year beginning in 2018  and reflected in the FY19 results  and 4 4  for the academic year commencing in 2019  to impact on FY20  




Funding in place  with increased flexibility
At the end of FY19  DIGS had available debt facilities of  335m  of which  252 1m had been drawn  Allowing for the  15 5m cash balance  net debt was  235 8m and the loan to value ratio  LTV  was 25 7   The blended average cost of the drawn debt was 2 94   with an average weighted maturity of c seven years 
The debt facilities comprise  235m of fixed rate borrowing at an average 2 96  and  100m of more flexible floating rate debt 
Towards funding the continuing growth of the portfolio  in FY19 the company raised gross proceeds of  43 1m by way of two non pre emptive placings of new ordinary shares and secured additional debt facilities amounting to  100m  The new debt facilities  with  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   comprise a three year re drawable credit facility of up to  45m at a margin of 1 85  above three month Libor and a development facility of up to  55m at a 3 1  margin over three month Libor during the construction phase  falling to 2 0  over Libor once the asset has been completed and stabilised 
The re drawable credit facility provides more flexible debt finance than fixed long term debt and will be available for use in funding the completion of Circus Street  Brighton  and initial construction costs at Scape Brighton  as well as general corporate purposes  The development facility will be drawn over time and is intended to part fund the construction of Scape Brighton  Once Scape Brighton is completed and stabilised  the development loan will be refinanced  allowing it to be repaid by the due date  December 2021 with a conditional option to extend for a further 12 months  
DIGS s immediate investment plans at end FY19 include the remaining forward funding commitments to Circus Street and to Scape Brighton  and the expected purchase of Scape Canalside under the forward purchase agreement  DIGS has indicated that if the acquisition of Scape Canalside were to be funded entirely with new borrowings  the LTV would increase to a c mid 30s percentage as the forward funded assets complete over the next 12 18 months 
No decision has yet been made as to whether to proceed with the conditional forward purchase agreement in respect of the Guildford asset 
Positive market developments
The London difference
The demand for full time higher education and the supply of purpose built accommodation is not evenly distributed across the UK  From a student demand supply perspective  the differentiating features of the London market  where 87  of DIGS s assets are located  can be summarised as 
It is home to 23 universities  with more ranked in the top 40 by The Times Higher Education World University Rankings than any other city in the world 
As a result of the high standard of education available and the wider appeal of London as a place in which to live  a quarter of all international students studying in the UK are based there 
London universities are only able to supply accommodation to c 30  of their first year and international students  New supply is constrained by planning restrictions and competing demands limit supply 
Brighton shares similar market dynamics to London  It is home to the University of Sussex  a UK top 20 university  and the University of Brighton  with an aggregate c 32 000 students including c 8 000 international students  The city is also home to two of the largest English language foundation course providers in the UK 
International student numbers continue to increase
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service  UCAS  show that at the 30 June 2019 application deadline for the 2019 20 academic year  international  excluding EU  student applications were ahead by 8 9  compared with 2018 19  with Chinese applications particularly strong   30    This is a very positive development for DIGS  for which international students currently account for 63  of the total  In addition to the strength of demand  international students are often less price sensitive than domestic students when it comes to choosing suitable accommodation  EU applications  14 0  of the total for DIGS  were also up  but by a smaller 1 1   Helping to counter Brexit uncertainties  EU students who entered in the previous 2018 19 academic year were guaranteed the same fee rates as UK students  as well as access to student finance for the duration of their courses  Including UK applications  down 1 1    total applications were up by 0 2  to 638k  The decline in UK domiciled applicants seems largely driven by demographics  although the long term decline in the number of UK 18  to 20 year olds should begin to reverse from 2020  while the desire to go to university  measured by participation rates  has continued to increase  Applications by UK students continue to significantly outstrip place acceptances by a margin of c 30  
Government encouraging further international growth
In March 2019  the UK Department for Education and International Trade published a plan to increase international student numbers by more than 30  and their income contribution to the economy from an estimated c  20bn currently to  35bn by 2030  There is no limit on the number of international students that can study in the UK and among the measures being suggested to achieve the new targets are proposals to extend the post study period during which students may remain in the UK and potential measures to support them into UK employment 
Augar proposals are positive
In May 2019 the report of the Augar Review of higher education suggested a reduction in tuition fees from the current  9 250 pa to  7 500 and an extension of student repayment periods from 30 to 40 years  The report also suggested a return of maintenance grants to assist poorer students  It is unclear whether and to what extent the proposals will be adopted by the government but  should this be the case  enactment should have a positive impact on UK student applications 
Migration towards top performing universities
Since the UK government raised tuition fees to a maximum of  9 000 pa in 2012  and subsequently increased to  9 250   which was followed by a removal of the cap on undergraduate student numbers in 2015  there is clear evidence that many students are influenced in their choice of university by its cost and the expected future benefit  This has enabled the top universities to grow in size while maintaining their academic requirements  Given its concentration of top universities  home to six of the top 40   London has benefited 




The London Plan
The London Plan  prepared by the Mayor of London  is expected to be introduced later this year  It has been reported that it will require new student developments to be in partnership with higher education institutions and let under nomination agreements with them  The plan is also expected to require the provision of affordable student accommodation within each new scheme  It seems likely that such measures will negatively affect new private schemes by increasing complexity and diminishing the expected returns  adding further to supply constraints  This is likely to increase the scarcity value of DIGS s existing and pipeline London assets  but it will also make further London growth more difficult  underling the value of the relationship with Scape 
London investment transactions supporting yields
Investor sentiment towards the asset class remains positive and this is reflected in  3 9bn of student assets having been traded or being under offer so far in 2019  This compares with  3 2bn of investment in the whole of 2018  The favourable supply demand environment and anticipation of the impact of the new London Plan can be seen in transactions relating to London assets and the continuing compression in London yields  also reflected in the DIGS portfolio 
We have previously commented on the August 2018 acquisition of a  350m stake in the  1 1bn  5 100 bed Chapter portfolio  alongside existing investor Greystar Real Estate Partners  by Allianz  DE ALVG  and PSP Investments  Gravis estimates the transaction to have been at an NIY of c 4 0   In March 2019  the same group of investors  through the Chapter portfolio  agreed to acquire an additional prime London student housing asset from Apache  NYSE APA  Capital  The transaction values the 458 bed Paul St East  EC2  purpose built student accommodation block in Shoreditch at more than  160m  which Gravis estimates reflects an NIY of 3 75   which is tighter than the NIY for Scape Shoreditch of 4 15  for the student accommodation and 4 33  overall  including the commercial space  
Also in March  Watkin Jones completed the  90m forward funding and sale of Kelaty House  a 599 bed student development in Wembley  to the real estate investment business of DWS  the investment management arm of  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  of Germany and a new entrant into the UK student accommodation market  Gravis estimates that the 4 90  agreed forward funding yield on the asset is consistent with a stabilised investment yield of c 4 5   Although Kelaty House and Scape Wembley are comparable in terms of size  the stabilised yield for Scape Wembley is 4 85  despite it benefiting from closer proximity to underground transport links  In August 2019  DWS followed up its Wembley investment by acquiring the regional Vita portfolio of c 3 200 beds for  600m at a yield estimated by Gravis to be c 5 30  
Valuation and performance
Performance continues to outpace 8 10  return target
The 8 10  long term return target that DIGS set at IPO reflects the anticipation of continued rental growth to drive income earnings and dividends  with a corresponding positive impact on capital values  assuming broadly stable yields and a positive impact from modest gearing  Returns since IPO have been well ahead of this target and the trend continued in FY19 
In the period from IPO  20 May 2013  to the last published quarterly NAV at 30 June 2019  end FY19   DIGS has generated an EPRA NAV total return  dividends reinvested  of 121 5  on the opening NAV per share  after issue costs  of 97p  or an annualised compound return of 13 9   Over the same period  the share price total return  dividends reinvested  was an aggregate 109 8  on the IPO price of 100p  or an annualised compound return of 12 9   The closing share price at 30 June 2019 was 162 2p 




The DIGS returns are ahead of the broad UK commercial property sector  the FTSE All Share Index and UK gilt returns over one  three and five years and since inception  The outperformance of DIGS compared with the broad UK commercial property sector has accelerated in recent months as the latter has been negatively affected by stresses in the retail subsector and more general economic uncertainty 
P NAV below historical average
Recent strong growth in DIGS s NAV has outpaced the increase in the share price  which trades at a small c 1 5  discount to EPRA NAV  This compares with an average premium of c 2 5  since IPO and a peak premium of 12 1  
Given that student accommodation as an asset class benefits from a more stable yield  with lower volatility than mainstream commercial property  the small discount to NAV appears attractive  Positive fundamentals in DIGS s target markets point to further rental growth  Combined with the completion and letting of assets under development  this should support future income growth and capital values  particularly given the continuing strong investor led interest in PBSA assets  especially in London 




In Exhibit 9  we show a summary valuation and share price performance comparison for the three UK listed student accommodation companies  DIGS  Unite and Empiric  DIGS offers a higher dividend yield compared with Unite and trades at a lower P NAV  Empiric has a higher yield but as it continues to reposition itself from internally driven trading problems in 2017  the prospects for dividend growth are modest  DIGS and Unite have both clearly outperformed the broad UK property sector and the FTSE All Share Index over the past year 
In the near term  the continuing strong fundamentals in DIGS s target areas of the market and the further benefit to earnings  cash flow and dividend cover from the completion of assets under development are positive indicators for DIGS s performance  Perhaps even more important is DIGS s focus on larger and more efficient  well designed and purpose built assets  in good locations in supply constrained markets  which provide comfort that the portfolio will be capable of sustaining performance over the long term ",2019-09-12,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gcp-student-living-continuing-to-benefit-from-strong-fundamentals-200463968,200463968

191699,413215,APA,Simple Market Timing Strategies That Work   August 09  2019,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to constantly time the market and continually make a profit is the dream for most traders and investors 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Oils Energy stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Alliance Resource Partners  L P   ARLP   Approach Resources Inc   AREX   Antero Resources Corporation  AR   AmeriGas Partners  L P   APU   Apache Corporation  NYSE APA 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

191702,413218,APA,Earnings Preview  Apache  APA  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Apache  APA  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and natural gas producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  84  
Revenues are expected to be  1 61 billion  down 16 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 56 74  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apache 
For Apache  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  62 48  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Apache will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Apache would post earnings of  0 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 10  delivering a surprise of  11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Apache doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-apache-apa-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200444043,200444043

Investors will be hoping for strength from APA as it approaches its next earnings release  On that day  APA is projected to report earnings of  0 22 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 56   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  1 69 billion  down 12 4  from the year ago period 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  1 03 per share and revenue of  6 97 billion  which would represent changes of  41 81  and  6 07   respectively  from the prior year

Gloomy Natural Gas Price Estimates
A huge portion of Chesapeake s volume mix consists of natural gas  In first quarter 2019  68 2  of the company s net production was natural gas  which is currently facing a tough market environment  Per U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   Henry Hub natural gas spot price is expected to be  2 77 MMBtu in 2019  indicating a 13 7  decrease from 2018 levels  This will likely result in a decline in the company s profit levels  Natural gas prices for 2020 are expected to stay flat with this year s projection  Hence  things are not expected to improve anytime soon 
Declining Output
The company s 2018 production was recorded at 521 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  Boe d   lower than the 2017 level of 548 000 Boe d  It issued its production guidance for 2019 in the range of 475 000 505 000 Boe d  With natural gas prices expected to remain low  decline in output will certainly result in lower earnings 
Rising Expenses
Chesapeake sproduction expenses in 2018 were recorded at  2 84 per Boe compared with  2 81 in 2017  Production expenses for 2019 are expected in the range of  3 25  3 50 per Boe  Also  Chesapeake projects drilling and completion costs through 2019 within  2 050  2 250 million compared with  2 086 million in 2018  The higher end of the projected range reflects a significant increase in drilling and completion costs in 2019  The higher expenses will put a dent in the company s bottom line in the future 
Overvalued Stock

Given these headwinds  Chesapeakeseems like a risky bet that ordinary investors should avoid

Eventually  Luminus Management  with ownership interest of 4 5  in the combined firm  has proposed to the board of directors of Ensco Rowan to payout a special dividend of  2 5 billion and urged to finance the payout with guaranteed bond offering  Luminus believes that the stock will gain momentum once the company shows commitment in returning capital back to the shareholders through dividend payment  following its recent decision to stop paying regular quarterly cash dividend

191720,413236,APA,Here s Why You Should Retain Antero Resources  AR  Stock Now,opinion,"Antero Resources Corporation   NYSE AR   is well poised to grow further  backed by robust Appalachian performance and growing capital efficiency 
The company   with a market cap of  1 8 billion   has an expected earnings growth rate of 20  for the next five years  For second quarter 2019  its earnings per share are projected at 9 cents  indicating a significant rise from the year ago reported figure of 2 cents  The estimate remained unchanged for past 30 days Cenovus Energy Inc Price and Consensus
    
Courtesy of solid prospects  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth holding on to at the moment 
What s Driving the Stock 
Antero Resources is among the fast growing natural gas producers in the United States  Its strategic acreage position in the low risk long reserve life properties of Appalachian Basin is a major positive  Antero Resources  core acreage position offers significant long lateral drilling opportunities and capital efficiencies 
The company boasts 486 000 and 126 000 net acres in Marcellus and Utica  respectively  which positions it well to boost production  Antero Resources  proved reserves have seen a 4  year over year growth in 2018  Notably  the company s solid output growth of 30  drove total revenues by 18  year over year to  1 212 million in first quarter 2019 
For 2019  Antero Resources targets average production of 3 150 3 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day  MMcfe d   significantly up from 2018 production of 2 709 MMcfe d  Moreover  the company expects production to witness a CAGR of 10 15  from 2020 through 2023  What s more encouraging is the fact the company plans to achieve the production growth through conservative capital expenditure  This reflects its improvement of capital efficiency 
Antero Resources boasts a healthy balance sheet with a manageable debt to capital ratio of 29 5   which is significantly lower than the industry average of 42 6   This provides the company with ample flexibility to make acquisitions or grow internally 
Antero Resources expects to generate free cash flow of  2 5  3 billion over the 2020 2023 period  given oil price stays around the  65 per barrel level  On the contrary  if oil and natural gas prices stay lower than the said level  the company expects free cash flow neutrality  Excess cash generation may further prompt the company to resort to more investor friendly moves  including share buybacks and dividend payout  in the long run 
Downsides
There are a few factors that are impeding the growth of the stock lately 
Antero Resources  per unit cash production expense in first quarter 2019 was  2 19 per Mcfe  reflecting a 6  increase from the year ago period  For 2019  the company makes an upward revision of the upper limit of cash production expense guidance to the range of  2 15  2 25  primarily due to a rise in transportation expenses 
Although it has strong foothold in the Appalachian region  the company s lack of geographic diversification is concerning  As such  it is more vulnerable to basin specific delays and interruptions in production from wells  which can potentially hamper growth 
Given the existing glut in the market and dampening demand outlook  demand growth for natural gas is expected to decline  Per U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   Henry Hub natural gas spot price is expected to be  2 77 MMBtu in 2019  indicating a 13 7  decrease from 2018 levels 
This will hamper the company s profits as its total production comprises more than 70  natural gas  Natural gas prices in 2020 are expected to be flat with this year s estimation  Hence  things are not expected to improve anytime soon 
To Sum Up
Despite riding on significant growth prospects as mentioned above  increasing costs and dampening demand outlook are concerns for the company  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth

Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents and the year ago figure of 78 cents  The outperformance primarily stemmed from strength in the company s projects in Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines  U S  Natural Gas Pipelines and Liquids segments  Contribution from growth projects that came online during the quarter was also responsible for the strong bottom line Also  the company reported comparable EBITDA of C 2 4 billion during the quarter  up from C 2 1 billion in the year ago period Comparable distributable cash flow  DCF  in the first quarter was C 1 6 billion  C 1 76 per share  compared with C 1 4 billion  C 1 63 per share  in the corresponding period of 2018 However  TC Energy s revenues of  2 6 billion were down more than 3  year over year due to weakness in the Power and Storage unit TC Energy Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segmental InformationCanadian Natural Gas Pipelines  This segment recorded comparable EBITDA of C 556 million  reflecting an increase of 12 6  from the year ago quarter  Depreciation recovery and higher rates from Canadian Mainline and NGTL systems  as well as strong customer demand across the network positively impacted the results U S  Natural Gas Pipelines  Comparable EBITDA generated from this segment amounted to C 972 million  up 20 9  from a year ago  The upside can be attributed to higher contributions from Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf growth projects on the back of record transportation volumes Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines  The segment s comparable EBITDA in the quarter under review came in at C 146 million  lower than C 160 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of the last year  The decrease could be attributed to a fall in equity earnings from TC Energy s investment in the Sur de Texas pipeline and decline in revenues from its systems amid changes in the timing of revenue recognition Liquids Pipelines  This unit generated comparable EBITDA of C 563 million in the fourth quarter  improving from the year ago level of C 431 million  The increase was driven by rising volumes in the Keystone Pipeline System  Moreover  higher earnings from liquids marketing activities played a positive role Power and Storage  During the first quarter  the segment reported comparable EBITDA of C 151 million  down 14 2  year over year  The decrease can be attributed to sale of TC Energy s interests in Cartier wind power facilities and cost overruns associated with the natural gas fired power plant in Ontario  CanadaCapital Expenditure and Balance SheetDuring the three months ended Mar 31  2019  TC Energy s capital investments totaled just over C 2 billion  As of the same date  the company had cash and cash equivalents of C 872 million  and a long term debt of C 35 9 billion  Its debt to capitalization ratio was 53 4  Key UpdatesTC Energy s current portfolio includes around C 30 billion of accretive growth projects  of which roughly C 7 billion worth projects are expecting completion by year end  TC Energy expects these growth projects to boost earnings and cash flow  This  in turn  will enable the company to generate annual dividend growth of 8 10  through 2021  As it is  TC Energy continues to advance the Keystone XL and Bruce Power life extension projects The company expects Coolidge generating station divestment to close by mid 2019  which will bring around  465 million  However  TC Energy has deferred the commercial start of the Napanee gas fired plant into the second half of 2019 from the earlier target of second quarter  The postponement follows an equipment failure during the commissioning activities During the quarter under review  TC Energy brought approximately C 5 3 billion of projects online  which included the Mountaineer XPress  Gulf XPress and expansions of certain NGTL pipeline systems  The company is progressing with its recently announced its C 6 2 billion Coastal GasLink pipeline project  while it received Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL program in

191749,413265,APA,Apache  APA  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Apache  APA  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Apache is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Apache  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Apache
This oil and natural gas producer is expected to earn  1 08 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of  39  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Apache  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 257 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Apache to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-05-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/apache-apa-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200423054,200423054

191756,413272,APA,Apache  APA  Surpasses Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Apache  APA  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 10 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 09 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 32 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11 11   A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil and natural gas producer would post earnings of  0 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 31  delivering a surprise of 24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Apache  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  posted revenues of  1 64 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 21   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 74 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Apache shares have added about 25 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 5  
What s Next for Apache 
While Apache has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Apache was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 25 on  1 72 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 08 on  7 04 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

market closes The Denver based company s earnings surprise history is unimpressive  The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  reporting average negative earnings surprise of 14 8  Antero Resources Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Which Way are Estimates Treading Let s take a look at estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents for first quarter earnings has seen two upward and four downward revisions by firms in the past 30 days  This figure indicates year over year growth of 2 3  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 160 million for the to be reported quarter  indicating a rise of 13  year over year Factors at PlayAntero  which is among the fast growing natural gas producers in the United States  boasts 486 000 and 126 000 net acres in Marcellus and Utica  respectively  which positions it well to report strong production in first quarter 2019 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter average daily net production is pegged at 3

period Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average net natural gas volumes is 2 173 million cubic feet per day  MMcf d   indicating a fall from 2 240MMcf d in the last reported quarter but a

rise from  3 73 per Mcf in the last reported quarter and  3 85 in the year ago period  Additionally  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price realizations after the impact of hedging is at  54 per barrel  implying a rise from  51 per barrel in the last reported quarter  However  it indicates a fall from  57 per barrel in the year ago quarter   As we can see  production of oil and gas is expected to surge on a year over year basis  Although natural gas price realization is anticipated to rise  thereby boosting the upcoming earnings  oil price is expected to take a dip in first quarter 2019 and affect the results partially What Our Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Antero Resources is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter to be reported  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below

191776,413292,APA,Is Apache  APA  Stock Outpacing Its Oils Energy Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Oils Energy space have likely heard of Apache  APA   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Oils Energy sector should help us answer this question 
Apache is one of 311 individual stocks in the Oils Energy sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  7 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst 
The Zacks Rank is a proven model that highlights a variety of stocks with the right characteristics to outperform the market over the next one to three months  The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks  APA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for APA s full year earnings has moved 90 65  higher  This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend 
Our latest available data shows that APA has returned about 38 78  since the start of the calendar year  Meanwhile  stocks in the Oils Energy group have gained about 16 70  on average  This means that Apache is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
Looking more specifically  APA belongs to the Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  a group that includes 74 individual stocks and currently sits at  96 in the Zacks Industry Rank  Stocks in this group have gained about 22 60  so far this year  so APA is performing better this group in terms of year to date returns 
Investors in the Oils Energy sector will want to keep a close eye on APA as it attempts to continue its solid performance ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-apache-apa-stock-outpacing-its-oilsenergy-peers-this-year-200410052,200410052
191777,413293,APA,Apache  APA  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Apache  APA  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and natural gas producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 12 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  62 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 66 billion  down 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 44 56  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apache 
For Apache  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 67  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Apache will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Apache would post earnings of  0 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 31  delivering a surprise of  24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Apache appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/apache-apa-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200410144,200410144

This oil and natural gas producer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 35 26  
For the last reported quarter  Apache came out with earnings of  0 31 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 25 per share  representing a surprise of 24   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 43 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 63 per share  delivering a surprise of 46 51  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Apache  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

191788,413304,APA,AR Or APA  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States sector have probably already heard of Antero Resources  AR  and Apache  APA   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Antero Resources is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Apache has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that AR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than APA has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
AR currently has a forward P E ratio of 23 64  while APA has a forward P E of 45 61  We also note that AR has a PEG ratio of 1 18  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  APA currently has a PEG ratio of 6 52 
Another notable valuation metric for AR is its P B ratio of 0 32  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  APA has a P B of 1 54 
Based on these metrics and many more  AR holds a Value grade of A  while APA has a Value grade of C 
AR sticks out from APA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that AR is the better option right now ",2019-03-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ar-or-apa-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200401419,200401419

191797,413313,APA,Earnings Preview  Apache  APA  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Apache  APA  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and natural gas producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 25 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 80 billion  up 13 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 86 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apache 
For Apache  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  36 31  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Apache will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Apache would post earnings of  0 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 63  delivering a surprise of  46 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

191815,413331,APA,Bitcoin Plunges Below  5 000 As A Battle Over Bitcoin Cash Erupts,opinion,"A Bitcoin Cash battle has engulfed the entire crypto sector  Ethereum project developer  William Entriken  explains 
Bitcoin Cash Battle  Bitcoin Jesus vs Satoshi s Vision
The battle over Bitcoin cash is getting very expensive  Escalating feuds have hit the entire crypto sector 
Cointelegraph reports Opposing Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV Factions  Debates Grow Heated as the Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Draws Closer

Born out of the original Bitcoin blockchain on August 1  2017  Bitcoin Cash  BCH  has split the cryptocurrency community into warring factions with their own arguments  verbal skirmishes  leaders  convictions and occasional get togethers  On November 15  BCH developers are preparing to undergo its next hard fork  a split of the blockchain  which can give birth to new tokens named Bitcoin SV  Satoshi s Vision   Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC 

Expensive Blockchain Governance
I asked William Entriken on the Ethereum project for his take  His email response follows 
Mish 
The governance process for public blockchains is extremely expensive  This is how it works 
The original project developers or another group of developers proposes a change  Each change requires significant adoption to be successful and each change is incompatible with the previous version 
Typically  changes to a blockchain project proposed by the original developers have been accepted by the community very quickly  But in the case of Bitcoin Cash  and previously with Ethereum Classic  billions of dollars in market value are lost while the community decides who will win 
These battles are somewhat comparable to hostile takeovers of technology companies and open source software battles  In the typical open source hostile takeover  a person or group can take control of the project or the company and get all the users  but they cannot walk away with any money 
Some notables Software Forks include OpenOffice org    LibreOffice  MySQL    MariaDB  XFree86    XOrg  KHTMl    Safari web browser  NCSA HTTPD    Apache  NYSE APA  web server 
Currency blockchain forks are so much more interesting because a group could potentially conspire to take all of the money  In practice  risk of outright theft by this method is slim  but it isn t zero 
The bigger risk is that changes in the fork may kill much of the monetary value of the losing fork  That s what s happening right now with Bitcoin Cash 
Because these battles are so expensive  I recommend that changes to public blockchains be may only when critically necessary  Meanwhile  everyone should be prepared for a weird outcome when a change proposed by the original developers of a project is soundly rejected by the community  That case will happen some day and it will have a destructive effect of more than  10 billion 
Regards 
Will

191816,413332,APA,Apache  APA  Near 52 Week Low  Still Promising Enough To Hold ,opinion,Shares of Apache Corporation   NYSE APA   have been on the red territory for a while now  with its shares declining around 14  over the past year   In the past month itself  the stock has declined more than 6   In fact  the share price  which closed at  35 04 yesterday  is quite close to the stock s 52 week low of  33 60  While the recent pullback in crude prices along with pipeline crisis in the Permian play are weighing on the stock  we believe that the Houston based energy explorer still holds much promise  as is validated by its Growth Score and of A   What s Going Against Apache  Notably  the three year oil industry downturn due to the global supply glut had hit Apache hard  The company slashed its capital expenditure budget in wake of commodities slump to realign itself with the changed dynamics  which adversely affected production volumes  In 2017  Apache s production averaged 349 717 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d   down 10  from 2016  Contracting output volumes are especially bad for independent production firms unlike integrated majors who have refining and marketing segments to fall back on  Despite the crude uptick for most part of this year  Apache is yet to recover from its long string of negative free cash flows  While Apache acquired Alpine High acreage for a good price  the region lacks energy infrastructure  which translates into a capital intensive and time consuming process for the company  Further  the ongoing pipeline takeaway constraints in the Permian Basin might not allow Apache to fully benefit from high oil prices for its production  In fact  the resulting Permian discounts may affect the capital expenditure plans of Apache  which is already burdened with elevated leverage of more than 51   Hopes of a Turnaround Notwithstanding the high capex associated with Alpine High assets  which may put pressure on the company s financials  we consider the Alpine High discovery in West Texas as a vital game changer  Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves  the wells are expected to drive strong economics and top tier returns going forward  The company has made some solid output projections for its Alpine High assets and forecasts its overall Permian production at 315 000 BOE d by 2020  which is almost double its 2017 figure of 158 000 BOE d  In fact  Apache forecasts its Alpine high output to witness a compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  of more than 150  through 2020  Moreover  total production is expected in the band of 475 000 510 000 BOE d by 2020  reflecting a double digit CAGR from the 2017 output level  While the pipeline pinch may be dampening investors  sentiments  it is to be noted that Apache has advanced the infrastructural development in the Alpine High by entering into a partnership with Kayne Anderson Acquisition Corporation for the creation of a pure play Permian Basin midstream firm Altus Midstream  in Texas  This midstream infrastructural development project holds much significance for Apache  providing it a competitive edge  As it is  various new pipelines will be coming online next year  providing respite to a considerable extent  Importantly  as part of streamlining its portfolio  Apache has divested its high cost Canadian assets  thereby freeing up capital to concentrate on its longer term high grade prospects  especially in the Permian basin  that now constitute more than half of its total output  The company has been focused on ramping up its portfolio and strategically redeploying capital to highest value opportunities  While Permian and Alpine High are the more significant assets of the company  Apache has certainly not put all its eggs in one basket  The company also has considerable acreage in Egypt and North Sea and expects robust cash flow from these assets in the coming years  Very recently  the company commenced production from Garten development in the North Sea and is currently producing at a rate of 13 700 barrels of oil and 15 700 cubic feet of gas per day  Notably  the recoverable resource in the field is expected to exceed 10 millions of oil and natural gas With the company bringing the field online ahead of its target of early 2019  the Garten project is expected to contribute significantly to its cash flow next year   Bottom Line With the company having lost 60  of its value since the past five years and currently trading at much lower prices  we think it s quite a bargain  Considering Apache s Permian focus along with midstream efforts we believe that the company will be able to counter the odds and turnaround in the coming years  Apache is expected to generate free cash flows from the next year  which will strengthen the overall financial picture of the company  Its earnings are estimated to witness long term growth of 7  and we think that it s prudent enough to hang on to this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock as of now   However  some better ranked players in the same include Antero Resources Corporation   NYSE AR    QEP Resources  Inc    NYSE QEP   and Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Antero Resources  long term earnings growth is expected at 20   Long term earnings growth of QEP Resources is pegged at

191819,413335,APA,Ahead Of OPEC  Oil Climbs On Significant Inventory Drawdown,opinion,The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly draw on the back of strong refinery runs  As a result  the front month West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained 1 8   or  1 15  to  66 22 per barrel yesterday The federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks  In fact  some of the biggest gainers of the S P 500 were oil and oil related stocks like Apache Corporation   NYSE APA    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO    Newfield Exploration Company   NYSE NFX    Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO    Devon Energy Corporation   NYSE DVN   and Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   Nevertheless  the commodity continues to remain under

Jun 22 in Vienna  which will decide what happens next regarding their supply curb policy Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5 9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 15  following a decrease of 4 1 million barrels in the previous week  The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 3 7 million barrels Record refinery throughput led to the larger than expected stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10 9 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half  In fact  stockpiles have shrunk in 43 of the last 63 weeks and are down more than 80 million barrels in the past year  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 426 5 million barrels  current crude supplies are 16  below the year ago figure and 2  under the five year average Moreover  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   fell 1 3 million barrels to 32 6 million barrels The crude supply cover was down from 25 2 days in the previous week to 24 5 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 29 5 days Gasoline  Gasoline supplies were up for the fourth time in five weeks as demand weakened  The 3 3 million barrels gain   defying the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 240 million barrels  Following last week s addition  the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year earlier level and is 6  over the five year range Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  went up 2 7 million barrels last week  again contrary to analysts  expectations for 700 000 barrels decrease in supply level  The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand  At 117 4 million barrels  current supplies are 23

natural gas prices increased 3 9  to  2 657 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  oil benchmark scored its second consecutive weekly bump  The major catalyst was the Energy Department s inventory release  which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 46 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April last year  The gradual fall   stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports   has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 420 5 million barrels  current crude supplies are 18 9  below the year ago period Meanwhile  natural gas prices moved higher last week following a larger than expected decrease in supplies

EQT with 680 000 core Marcellus acres and 65 000 Ohio Utica acres With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters  this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital  compared with the previous company set up that constrained the company s returns in the recent years  Additionally   2 3  2 8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019 2023 timeframe is expected to trickle down from the move  which forecasts 10 15  annual production growth   Read more  4     U S  energy firm Apache Corporation reported fourth quarter earnings per share

and expenses soared 190  to  1 305 million from the same quarter last year  The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to  980 million compared with  229 million in the prior year quarter  while operating and maintenance expenses rose 87 7  year over year to  137 million Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full year 2018 following the better than expected

191851,413367,APA,Abandon These 5 Toxic Stocks Or Sell Short For Profit,opinion,Investors with the ability to differentiate between overhyped and pricey toxic stocks and the correctly priced ones emerge winners at the end  However  precise identification of these two types of stocks is not simple as these are entangled in the market place in a very complex way  Investors who can accurately spot toxic stocks and get rid of them at the right time are set to gain Most of the times  the overpriced toxic stocks are susceptible to external shocks and are loaded with a hefty amount of debt  Moreover  the price of toxic stocks is unrealistically high  The high price of toxic stocks is only short lived as the intrinsic value of the toxic stocks falls short of the current bloated price The irrationally high price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock  Owning such stocks for an inordinate period of time is harmful to investors and may lead to huge erosion of wealth On the other side  investors may benefit from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  figuring out toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses  Profits can be made by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average  High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50  A very high forward P E implies

191852,413368,APA,Crude Oil  Down For Christmas,opinion,"Forties is down till Christmas  in the old North Sea  it will slow those oil flows into Scotland s refineries  Christmas will find price hikes  all the way downstream  Forties is down till Christmas and the oil price will scream 
Ho Ho Ho  A shut down of the major Forties pipeline  a major artery in the global oil market  caused a spike in the dated Brent market and is supporting oil products around the globe  The shut down should go to at least Christmas and maybe even longer  A detected crack in the pipeline led to a total shutdown of the system for the first time in at least 7 years  This is going to further tighten an already tight dated Brent market that was supported by OPEC production cuts and surging European and Asian oil demand 
The pipeline system transports more than 40 percent of the U K  s North Sea oil production leaving that market in a deep hole  This oil can t be easily replaced as other sweet oil producers are near their limits  Shale oil in the U S  may help  but the producers can t quickly ramp up supply nor can they move the oil fast enough to alleviate the shortage  The reverberations of this outage will be felt at first in Asia and Europe  but it will have ramifications for oil product prices around the globe 
If this was not enough  reports of an explosion in Austria s largest import hub for natural gas sent U K  gas surging to the upside  Reports say that The Baumgartner facility  had an explosion and fire around 7 45am London time and it is said to be an accident and not terror related  Same day gas prices in the U K  rose 40 percent to 95 pence per therm  the highest since 2013 according to reports 
U S  WTI prices are rising and a report by Genscape that said that U S  crude supply in Cushing Oklahoma dropped by a massive Cushing inventory  3 1 million barrels  Keystone pipeine issues and record refinery runs is going to add to the momentum 
For products  this means higher prices  Gas oil will soar as supply of gas oil is below average for this time of year raising fears of shortages this winter  The pipeline outage has had issues for producers as well  Bloomberg says that the unplanned shutdown prompted Serica Energy  LON SQZ  to cut its output guidance for the year  sending its shares tumbling by as much as 10 percent in London trading on Tuesday  Explorers Enquest  LON ENQ  and Premier Oil  OTC PMOIY   also initially declined  before rebounding 
The U K  link handles supplies from over 80 fields  and the shutdown forced Apache Corp  NYSE APA   to suspend operations at its nearby Forties asset  Pipeline operator Ineos Group Ltd  said it will know in the  next few days  whether the system will be closed for two or three weeks  after declaring a  force majeure situation  
So this raises the stakes for economies around the globe  With a hot 3 1  inflation rate in the U K  the coming oil price spike may force them to look to raise interest rates  Other countries now have to brace for the impact of a potential oil price spike  Oh Shale  Save me now ",2017-12-12,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-oil-down-for-christmas-200272541,200272541

Energy Stocks Gain
The bullish data sets encouraged buying in energy stocks  which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR   an assortment of the largest U S  energy companies   almost 0 7  Wednesday  Some of the biggest gainers of the S P 500 yesterday were oil and oil related companies like Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc    NYSE DO    Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK    Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO    Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN    Apache Corp    NYSE APA   and Newfield Exploration Company   NYSE NFX   
Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 4 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 15  following an increase of 5 9 million barrels in the previous week  The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 2 4 million barrels 
Volume ramp up from the import and production facilities shuttered in the wake of hurricane Harvey led to the big stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer 
Despite the substantial climb in oil storage for a third straight week  current supplies   at 472 8 million barrels   are still marginally below the year ago period  However  stocks are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year 
Meanwhile  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was up by 703 000 barrels to 59 8 million barrels 
The crude supply cover was up from 29 4 days in the previous week to 30 8 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 30 2 days 
Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were down for the third week running as Gulf Coast refineries sidelined by Harvey continue to ramp up throughput  The 2 1 million barrels draw   above the polled number of 800 000 barrels fall in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles down to 216 2 million barrels  Following last week s slide  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 4  below the year earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  went down by 5 7 million barrels last week  compared with analysts  expectations for one million barrels decrease in supply level  The largest weekly fall since 2011 could be again be attributed to recovering refinery post storm induced outages  At 138 9 million barrels  current supplies are 15 8  below the year ago level but are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 5 5  from the prior week to 83 2   While refinery runs rebounded from the previous week s nine year lows  it s still a far cry from the pre Harvey rates of 96 6    the highest since 2005  With more units returning to activity over the coming weeks  we expect utilization and throughput to continue to rise 
About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week ending Friday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry

191880,413396,APA,5 Toxic Stocks To Cast Aside Or Sell Short For Profit,opinion,Successful investing depends upon proper identification of overpriced stocks and rightly priced stocks  However  the fairly priced stocks and the overhyped toxic stocks are mingled in the marketplace in such a way that it becomes very difficult to distinguish them  Investors who can accurately figure out the toxic stocks and cast them aside at the right time are likely to benefit Usually  toxic stocks are susceptible to outside shocks and are burdened with high levels of debt  Also  price of the toxic stocks is unjustifiably high  The irrationally inflated price of the toxic stocks is only short lived as the inherent value of these stocks is lower than the current bloated price The higher price of toxic stocks is either due to an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental lacunae in the stock  Owning such stocks for a longer period of time may result in huge loss of wealth On the other hand  investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  identifying toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to shield your portfolio from big losses  Profits can be made by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt

191899,413415,APA,Delta Air Lines  Apache  Wynn Resorts  Melco Crown Entertainment And Las Vegas Sands Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   July 10  2017   Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Apache  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ         Melco Crown Entertainment  NASDAQ        and Las Vegas Sands  NYSE        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	With slumping oil prices  a number of industries in the broader transportation world look to benefit  One that should definitely come to mind in this type of environment is the airline space  This area tends to see a sizable percentage of its costs go to fuel  so a reduced or at least stable oil price should be great news for this segment 

	We have definitely seen airline companies bounce back in recent months  partially as a result of these lower oil prices  though a stronger U S  economy isn t hurting matters either  No wonder the industry currently has an industry rank in the top 5   and why not a single stock in the group has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   out of nearly two dozen companies 

	But which company do you want to focus on in this impressive group 

	Well  one that might deserve a closer look isDelta Air Lines  NYSE         This might be one of the best positioned in the space  at least if we look to earnings estimate revisions as a guide 

Recent Estimates

	In the last two months  analysts covering Delta stock have been raising their estimates for the company s earnings  almost universally  We have seen five estimates go higher in the current quarter  and six go higher for the current year time frame 

	This has also helped to boost the consensus estimate for DAL stock  as we have seen the current quarter projection increase by 3 8  in the past two months and over 7  for the next quarter  The full year estimate has moved higher by over five percent in the same time frame  and analysts now expect year over year growth for the company on the earnings front too 

	The most recent estimates on DAL stock have also been higher  and the company has a great history in earnings season and can clearly live up to expectations on a regular basis  In fact  Delta has only missed earnings estimates once in the past three years  so it certainly has a good track record 

  

	Oil has been struggling as of late  and the energy sector has easily been the worst performing major market segment to start 2017  This is despite some recent news that was actually pretty positive for the space  as we saw a rather large drawdown in the EIA report this past week 

	However  shale production in the U S  remains high  and global supplies of oil are surging  led by rising Libyan output and the unlikely prospect of Russia agreeing to further OPEC led cuts  So  in this type of environment  oil has a hard time breaking out higher  even on what would otherwise be solid news 

	As you might expect  this situation is pretty poor for energy focused stocks  as the sector currently occupies the bottom of the sector rank list  And in terms of weak industries  the exploration space is especially troubled  and has a bottom 25  industry rank to reflect that standing too  Due to this  it is probably a good idea to avoid Apache  NYSE       in this environment  and that is especially the case if we look to earnings estimate revisions for this company too 

APA Estimates

	Thanks to the rough energy situation  exploration and production companies like Apache are in a rough spot  Sure  earnings are expected to grow when compared to the even more horrid environment of last year  but things aren t looking as impressive as they used to for this company 

	In fact  over the past sixty days  we have seen five estimates go lower for the current quarter earnings compared to just one higher  while we have seen a similar trend for the current year  as eight estimates have gone lower compared to just two higher 

	The magnitude of these estimate cuts has also been pretty intense  as the consensus has fallen from 20 cents a share sixty days ago to just 13 cents a share today  while we have seen a slashing of the consensus from  1 18 share to  0 80 share in the same time frame for the current year 

	That isn t even the end of the bad news though  as the most accurate estimate is even lower  The most accurate estimate for the current quarter is just 11 cents per share a 15  reduction while the current year is at sixty cents per share  a 25  reduction from the current consensus

191922,413438,APA,A Flood Of Oil Earnings On May 4  APA  CHK  MRO  OXY,opinion,Markets are a little more than halfway through the Q1 earnings season  with 57 6  S P 500 members having reported results as of Friday  Apr 28 Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q1 results from 288 S P 500 members that combined account for 63 8  of the index s total market capitalization  According to our latest   total earnings for these companies are up 13 7  from the same period last year on 8 2  higher revenues  with 76 4  delivering positive earnings surprises and 68 1  beating revenue estimates Energy Earnings SoarThe  Energy  sector has been off to a spectacular start  For the 48 5  sector components on the S P 500 index that have reported Q1 results  total earnings surged 360  on 30 7  higher revenues  While three fourths of the companies have been successful in beating earnings estimates  56 3  of them have outperformed the top line Let s take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the first three months of this year Q1 Report Card  Prices Move Lower but Recover from Year Ago LowsDespite hope offered by the biggest oil deal in a decade and a new pro fossil fuel administration in the White House  crude prices logged a loss of almost 6  for the first quarter as traders focused on the rising flood of U S  shale driven production In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more  With the recent uptick in U S  shale production putting more pressure on the market  oil ended the first quarter at  50 60 per barrel  5 8  lower than year end 2016 prices Natural gas fared worse  dropping more than 14  in the Jan Mar period  thanks to one of the mildest winters on record  A warmer winter translated into tepid requirement for the heating fuel and upended demand forecasts Despite the sequential fall  both oil and natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016  While crude slumped to a 12 year low  natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years Year over Year Gains Leads to Bullish ExpectationsEnding the dismal trend from the past few quarters  a look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil Energy sector finally turned the corner  driving the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index The Oct Dec 2016 period turned out to be a rather good one with the OPEC deal and extreme weather conditions engineering a hefty rise in oil and gas prices during the fourth quarter A historic OPEC production cut agreement  together with help from non OPEC producers saw oil prices end the year at  53 72 a barrel  representing a gain of 11 4  sequentially and 45  for the year  Meanwhile  natural gas embarked on its own upward journey  with futures jumping around 25  just in the fourth quarter  Ending the year at  3 724 per million Btu  MMBtu    up 59  from 2015   the heating fuel was buoyed by a cold snap that translated into strong demand As a result  following 8 back to back quarters of earnings declines  analysts said that the sector was likely to get better in the fourth quarter and clock its first positive earnings growth after 2 years  With estimate revisions going up following OPEC s Algeria grandstand  the Oil Energy sector s earnings were expected to improve handsomely from the fourth quarter 2015 levels True to the predictions  the sector came out swinging  For the sector components on the S P 500 index  total Q4 earnings were up 17 1  on 2 0  higher revenues The picture looks rather encouraging for the ongoing Q1 earnings season as well  This is not surprising  considering that oil and gas both fell to multi year lows in the year ago period  In fact  the  Energy  sector is set to turn around from a modest loss in the year earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter Importantly  as per our analysis  the aggregate dollar amount of earnings increase for the Energy sector is the highest of all 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy expected to earn a total of  7 7 billion in Q1 against a loss  1 6 billion in the year earlier quarter  The top line is likely to show impressive growth of 29 8  from the first quarter 2016 levels  while margins are set to improve 4 4  Stocks to Watch for Earnings on May 4Let s see what s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with Mar quarter numbers on Thursday  May 4 Firstly  there is Apache Corp    NYSE APA     one of the world s leading explorer and producer of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids   which is expected to report before the opening bell  In the fourth quarter of 2016  this Houston  TX headquartered upstream player reported a surprise loss on a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget  Coming to earnings surprise history  the company has a mixed record  its underperformed estimates in two of the last four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 19 89  Worryingly  our model does not indicate that Apache is likely to beat on earnings this time around too  This is because  as per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to beat earnings  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  For the quarter to be reported  Apache has an earnings ESP of  11 11   making surprise prediction difficult  The company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further decreases the predictive power of ESP  making us less confident of an earnings surprise call   As it is  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    We also have Oklahoma City  OK based Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK   coming out with first quarter 2017 results ahead of market opening  As far as earnings surprise history is concerned  Chesapeake   the second largest natural gas producer in the U S  with main focus on onshore resources   has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters But with an Earnings ESP of  10 53  and Zacks Rank  3  our proven model shows that an earnings beat is not guaranteed for Chesapeake Energy in the to be reported quarter  Chesapeake Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   is another leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company scheduled to report quarterly numbers   this time after the market close While aggressive cost reduction and strong operational execution drove the company to outperformances in each of the past four quarters  the trend might not continue this time around  With an Earnings ESP of  12 50  and a Zacks Rank  3  our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for Marathon Oil in the upcoming quarterly release   Read more   Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Lastly  there is Occidental Petroleum Corp    NYSE OXY   coming up with Jan Mar operational results before the opening bell  An integrated oil and gas company with significant exploration and production exposure  Houston  TX based Occidental Petroleum is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals  petrochemicals  polymers and specialty chemicals As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the company has a bad track of having missed estimates thrice in the last four quarters  And our model does not indicate that Occidental Petroleum is likely to beat on earnings this time around  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  35 71   Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult   Read more   Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    The Best

Like the CRB index  the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil recovered earlier this year after plunging by 76  from mid 2014 through early 2016  It has been hovering between  42 and  52 since mid April 
In many ways  the price of oil is the tail that s wagging the dog  It is highly inversely correlated with the trade weighted dollar  Causality probably runs both ways  so a weaker  stronger  oil price seems to put upward  downward  pressure on the dollar  That may be because oil exporters have fewer  more  dollars to convert to other currencies when the price is weak  strong  
Of course  there is a feedback effect from the dollar to oil and other commodity prices  The CRB raw industrials spot price index  which doesn t include oil  tends to strengthen  weaken  when the dollar is weak  strong  
For now  I foresee the choppy sideways actions of the dollar  oil prices  and other industrial commodity prices continuing through the middle of next year  The Fed s process of gradually normalizing interest rates is turning out to be very gradual  which should keep the dollar from moving higher given that it is up 19  from its low on July 1  2014 
On Monday  Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that the Fed US econometric model shows that such an increase is equivalent to a 200bps hike in the federal funds rate  In other words  the foreign exchange market has already done much of the Fed s work 
Nevertheless  if the oil market s fundamentals push the price of oil back down again  the dollar could move still higher and depress other commodity prices  So let s review the latest developments in oil s supply and demand 
 1  Inventories  The combination of weak demand and increased OPEC output pushed oil inventories in developed nations to a record 3 1 billion barrels in July  This week  the International Energy Agency  IEA  predicted that the surplus in global oil markets will last for longer than previously estimated  So world oil stockpiles will continue to rise through 2017  resulting in a fourth consecutive year of oversupply  Just last month  the IEA predicted the market would return to equilibrium this year 
 2  Supply  The IEA s revised estimates of the supply demand oil balance on Tuesday followed a similar revision by OPEC on Monday  The 9 12 WSJ    In its closely watched monthly report on market conditions  OPEC said non OPEC members like the U S   Russia and Norway will produce about 190 000 barrels a day more than expected in 2016  a sign that production outside the cartel has remained resilient despite low prices  By 2017  the cartel s data suggests that oil supplies will outstrip demand by an average of about 760 000 barrels a day  over three times higher than OPEC predictions made just last month  
 3  Strategic petroleum reserve  In August  the US Department of Energy  its  Long Term Strategic Review of the U S  Strategic Petroleum Reserve   It said that instead of the nearly 700 million barrels the US currently stockpiles  an SPR around 530 600 million barrels would be more appropriate  Much has changed since the SPR was set up in the aftermath of the 1973 oil embargo  The US is one of the largest oil producers in the world  so energy security isn t as important 
 4  US production  That all seems very bearish for oil prices  However  keep in mind that lower oil prices probably will continue to reduce oil production in the US  Arguably  the new swing producer in the oil market is now the US rather than Saudi Arabia  The weekly US oil rig count seems to be a very good 18 month leading indicator of weekly oil field production in the US 
Production is down 11 5  from a recent high of 9 6mbd during the week of July 3  2015 to 8 5mbd during the week of September 2  2016  The rig count has rebounded slightly in recent weeks  but remains down sharply from the peak of late 2015  The implied drop in US oil production could provide some bullish support to offset the bearish factors highlighted in the IEA and OPEC reports 
Meanwhile  US gasoline demand over the past 52 weeks through the 9 2 week rose to 9 3mbd  matching the previous record high during 2007 
On the other hand  Apache found lots more oil last week  The 9 7 WSJ    Apache Corp  NYSE APA   said it has discovered the equivalent of at least two billion barrels of oil in a new West Texas field that has the promise to become one of the biggest energy finds of the past decade  The discovery  which Apache is calling  Alpine High   is in an area near the Davis Mountains that had been overlooked by geologists and engineers  who believed it would be a poor fit for hydraulic fracturing  ",2016-09-16,Ed Yardeni,https://www.investing.com/analysis/slip-sliding-in-the-oil-patch-200153833,200153833

191950,413466,APA,Apache Gains Big On New Oil Field,opinion,"Apache Corporation  NYSE APA  is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  The company made an announcement that it had discovered a new source of oil  Today  we ll talk about the news  what we saw in the market as a result  and what we can expect to see from APA ahead  So  let s get right to it 
APA Discovers New Oil Field
As mentioned above Apache is having a strong day in the market after announcing that it had discovered a new oil field  According to the announcement  the field was discovered in west Texas near the Davis Mountains  The new oil field has been named  Alpine High  
This isn t a small discovery either  In fact  APA said that they expect that the new discovered land holds the equivalent of at least 2 billion barrels of oil  To put that into perspective  even if the company only got the minimum out of the land  it would be worth about  8 billion 
In the announcement  we ve learned that the company has been working on this field for quite some time  In fact  over the past 2 years  APA has purchased the majority of the 450 000 acre field  Today  the company owns 352 000 acres of the field that it purchased at an average price of about  1 300 per acre  To date  there have been 19 wells drilled in the Alpine High field  9 of these wells have started producing limited quantities due to infrastructure pressures  Here s a key snippet offered from the company s press release   

    after more than two years of extensive geologic and geophysical work  methodical acreage accumulation  and strategic testing and delineation drilling  the company can confirm the discovery of a significant new resource play  the  Alpine High   Apache s Alpine High acreage lies in the southern portion of the Deleware Basin  primarily in Reeves County  Texas 

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that it s important to watch the news  After all  the news has a tendency to move the market  When positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the stock associated with the news  The news released with regard to the Apache Corporation today was overwhelmingly positive  So  it only makes sense that we re seeing gains in the value of the stock  Currently  12 12   the stock is trading at  55 71 per share after a gain of  4 04 per share or 7 82  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from APA  First and foremost  the news of the new oil field and the massive amount of oil that is expected to be produced out of that field is overwhelmingly positive  It doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this will likely lead to stronger revenue  exciting investors and leading to gains in the stock ",2016-09-07,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/apache-gains-big-on-new-oil-field-200152262,200152262

Clovis Oncology Inc  NASDAQ CLVS  is really acting well  up 3 66  or 15   to 28 01  on 12 5 million shares traded  When we first saw the pop and pullback  we gave you a buy on it  It popped again and pulled back  Nevertheless  looking at the pattern  it appears that the rising channel has been spiked through  If that is the case  this stock may very well test as early as Friday  the 31 00 range  Any follow through in that area will be 36  but that s a big one  It has 10 days to cover 
Emerge Energy Services LP  NYSE EMES   which I ve been following for a long time  was a disaster and a Boxer Short ever since it wedged several times  and then kept on going in a long down channel  Finally  after getting under 2 00  it popped up  pulled back  and popped up again  consolidated  and now it s breaking out  Thursday s move of 1 65  or almost 13   to 14 51  on 1 1 million shares traded was significant  My next target on this one is 18 short term  and then 21 mid channel 
Puma Biotechnology  NYSE PBYI   which I put another swing on Thursday  is moving forward  up 1 01  or 2   to 59 02  on 362 290 shares traded  The reason I put the swing on it is because  when I get a parallel declining channel that goes from 207 9 down to 19  and change  forms an inverse head and shoulders  breaks out and flags a couple of times  looks to me like it has to have one more leg up  That leg could take it to the high 70 s  maybe even 80 s  It has 6 4 days to cover 
Vuzix Corp Cmn Stk  NASDAQ VUZI  had a huge day on Thursday  up 59 cents  or 6 48   to 9 69  on 946 931 shares traded  If you look at the chart  you will see that we reached the 9 60 and 9 75 targets  and on Thursday  it reached a high of 9 80  Technically  if it moves through this level  it may very well make it up to my next at 12 00

5 Top Ranked Energy Bargains for Value Investors

Oil prices are bouncing back after shaking off the Brexit bombshell that surprised investors late last week and sent the commodity to a seven week low on strengthening dollar and fears of a global economic slowdown 

While Brexit will be a blow to U S  oil explorers and producers like Apache Corp  NYSE APA    which get around a fifth of their sales from the U K   such cases are few and far between  In any case  the U K  constitutes a miniscule 1 6  of global crude demand  so the commodity is unlikely to be too affected by a Brexit vote  Moreover  with core oil fundamentals still unchanged  the commodity is well set for a long term recovery though one might have to wait for the dust to settle 

The Crude Resurgence

Crude prices  which reached  110 per barrel in mid 2014  fell to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb as investors worried about the oversupplied market  The commodity s collapse threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer s profit margins 

However  indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound some 90  since then 

The surge in benchmark crude is being driven by supply outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude 

The upward pressure in oil prices also reflect the U S  Energy Department s recent inventory releases that show crude stockpile builds turning into draws  Things have been further helped by a continued decline in U S  crude production and drop in oil directed rigs   indicating a break in shale drilling activities 

But Prices Remain Under  50

Despite oil s massive recovery since February  it s still under  50   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  Therefore  the commodity is not yet out of the woods and record high inventories amid robust production could still push it to the depths of multiyear lows  As a result  the profit margins of several players from the industry have seen massive declines  This has hit stock prices as well 

Nevertheless  this has made many stocks not only cheap but also really good bargains  Although the overall bearish sentiment on the oil and gas industry took all stocks down with it  yet some of these remain fundamentally strong 

Look for Fundamentally Strong Cheap Stocks

While there can be many reasons to sell a stock  there is usually a single reason to buy  Who wouldn t want to pocket a few extra bucks  Low priced stocks never go out of fashion and one doesn t really need to be a genius to understand why 

For starters  one can buy a lot many shares of a company for a certain amount  While expenditures seem to increase exponentially  the same is usually not true for our income  From the little that we actually manage to set aside for investment  one would definitely prefer to buy 100 shares  say at around  20  rather than buying 10 shares at  200  Often these  20 firms hold tremendous potential but remain off investors  radar 

However  most of these players are generally not industry giants and hence  a little extra effort must be put in to select the correct stocks  This is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy

191998,413514,APA,5 Energy Stocks To Watch For Gains This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Oil prices dropped to two month lows of around  45 a barrel on Friday over indications of resurgence in shale drilling activities and signs of economic sluggishness in Asia  A strong dollar   which makes the greenback priced crude dearer for investors holding foreign currency   also played spoilsport  As it is  traders are concerned over the effects of Brexit   the short way of saying Britain s exit from the EU   on crude demand 
Despite the recent weakness  oil prices have gained handsomely since plunging to its lowest point in a decade earlier this year 
The Multi Month Oil Price Rally
Crude prices  which reached  110 per barrel in mid 2014  fell to a 12 year low of  26 21 in February as investors worried about the oversupplied market  The commodity s collapse threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer s profit margins 
However  indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound some 90  since then and took the commodity past  50 
The surge in benchmark crude was being driven by supply outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude 
The upward pressure in oil prices also reflect the U S  Energy Department s recent inventory releases that show crude stockpile builds turning into draws  Things have been further helped by a continued decline in U S  crude production 
Q2  Best Quarter in 7 Years 
Unlike the previous few quarters  second quarter 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with crude advancing more than 26  sequentially    the best quarterly percentage gain in 7 years  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures during the Apr Jun 2016 period hovered mostly between  40 and  50 per barrel 
All s Not Well  Though
Despite oil s massive recovery since February  it s still under  50   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  Therefore  the commodity is not yet out of the woods 
Even the industry  which is cutting deeper  seems to think so  Companies around the world continue to slash jobs  defer cancel projects worth billions of dollars and renegotiate contracts with suppliers to help protect their balance sheets 
Consequently  things are looking bleak for the upcoming Q2 earnings season  The Oil Energy sector s earnings are expected to crash 76 8  from the second quarter 2015 levels  while the top line is likely to show a drop of 27  
How to Identify the Outperformers 
Despite the miserable figures  there are a number of companies that are likely to beat our second quarter earnings estimates 
Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors  This is because a stock generally surges upon an earnings beat 
But with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better than expected earnings 
While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  our proprietary methodology      makes it relatively simple 
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70

192007,413523,APA,Brexit  How Does It Affect Energy  Here Are A Few Answers ,opinion,"The Votes Are In    Great Britain Will Not Remain Part Of The European Union  EU 
By a margin of 51 9  to 48 1  on a 72 2  turnout  the U K  electorate voted to leave the EU in a historic referendum 
Why the  NO  Vote
Supporters of  Vote Leave  mainly point toward Europe s migration crisis and continued Eurozone travails  Their stance is based on the premise that the EU has out served its purpose and has held back Britain  Exit from the bloc can help Britain to have free trade deals with countries  take back full control of its borders and choose who comes to their country 
The skeptics were able to outnumber the  Remain  camp who believed that Britain gets a boost from EU membership  as it makes selling things to EU countries easier  Moreover  the flow of immigrants fuels economic growth 
Triggers Market Uncertainty
Following Brexit   the short way of saying Britain s exit from the EU   the FTSE 250 index plunged more than 10   The seismic shock from the  Leave  campaign victory has been so severe that Prime Minister David Cameron announced his decision to resign from his post by October 
However  the impact to secede from the EU is unlikely to remain insulated to Britain 
As expected  the undeniable and immediate fallout was the plunge in the value of the British pound  which crashed to 1985 lows  This would lead to a flight toward safe haven currencies like the dollar  A stronger dollar would create multiple challenges for a Federal Reserve which has just wound up a program of monetary easing and is looking for opportunities to raise rates 
In such a scenario  it is next to impossible that U S  markets would be spared  In fact  by the looks of the futures  the US markets are expected to experience a  Black Friday  and effects of the stunning development are likely to be felt not only throughout today s trading session but also in the days to come 
With Britain accounting for   a hammering for U S  stocks cannot be ruled out in the wake of Brexit turning into a reality  US firms  with exposure to Britain  are likely to hit badly with the tumbling pound reducing U S  earnings on repatriating the income 
And Oil Selloff
Adding to the general atmosphere of chaos in the markets  the British referendum to break with Europe also buckled oil prices  which retreated more than 6  to under  48 a barrel Oils Energy Sector Price Index
The biggest single day plunge in over 2 months could be traced to the following concerns 
The most pressing concern for the industry right now is the exacerbation of the already challenging environment created by the low oil prices  As it is  crude prices fell to a 12 year low in Feb  threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer s profit margins 
However  indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound some 90  since then  At this juncture  Brexit will only add to the wave of uncertainties and increase the commodity s volatility 
The ensuing market turmoil   amid talks of a second Scottish Independence referendum   might impact investment plans for new project sanctions that is already at a historic low because of the oil price crash 
There is a belief among the U S  officials that exit of the world s fifth largest economy from the EU will hit U S   biggest trading partner s growth  which in turn will weaken the domestic economy and reduce oil demand 
European oil companies like TOTAL S A    TO TOT   and Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO   employ a number of U K  workers in EU countries and vice versa  Following Brexit  these workers might have to be granted  non EU  citizen status that could escalate employer costs   something the industry would like to avoid in this low price environment 
The dollar s strengthening will likely make the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency and suppress prices 
Energy Investors  Prepare for a Bumpy Ride  but Don t Panic
While Brexit will be a blow to U S  oil explorers and producers like Apache Corp    NYSE APA     that get around a fifth of their sales from the U K    such cases are few and far between  In any case  the U K  constitutes a miniscule 1 6  of global crude demand  so the commodity is unlikely to be too affected by a Brexit vote  Moreover  with core oil fundamentals still unchanged  the commodity is well set for a long term recovery though one might have to wait for the dust to settle 
In fact  once the hoopla over Brexit dies down  the two Britain based oil majors   Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP     could even become attractive investment options  With oil futures plunging  these quality names are likely to get sold off sharply amid the global financial panic  Considering that both Shell and BP are well positioned to leverage the world s growing energy need  one could buy them later in the summer at even lower prices when they move upward from their current Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The weak pound will make dollar based investing even more attractive ",2016-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brexit:-how-does-it-affect-energy-here-are-a-few-answers-200138128,200138128

192026,413542,APA,One Of The Best Plays In Argentinian Shale Right Now,opinion,"Argentina is home to some of the largest shale oil and gas reserves in the world  and it has some of the best chances to be the first country to replicate the U S  shale revolution outside of North America 
International investment has been tricky in Argentina since the country has largely been locked out of financial markets due to the ongoing debt standoff the government is engaged in with creditors  dating back to the country s default in 2001 
Still  the enormous Vaca Muerta shale basin is  world class    to Credit Suisse analysts  The partially state owned Argentine oil company  YPF  NYSE YPF   stands to be a major beneficiary of an Argentine shale revolution  And there are several reasons that YPF could be a smart play for investors looking at the Vaca Muerta  Read more  
First  oil prices are more heavily regulated in Argentina  which hindered the company s financial position when international oil prices were above  100 per barrel  but protect the company when prices are low  While other companies around the world are suffering from low prices  YPF can at least enjoy the certainty of regulation  Read more  
Second  the Argentine government may get a whole lot friendlier to international investors this fall after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner leaves office  That is especially true if the pro business candidate Mauricio Macri pulls out a victory  But no matter who wins  there is a decent chance that the conflict with Argentina s creditors finds a solution with the new administration  Read more  
One of the most successful traders of the past 30 years is shrouded in mystery  Since  breaking the Bank of England  in 1992 and moving  280 million a day in the markets this Englishman retired to North Carolina  That s where it gets interesting  Just recently he granted an interview about what he s been up to  and what you ll see in just the first three minutes will change the way you look at investing 
More importantly  the Vaca Muerta has very large oil and gas reserves and YPF is leading the charge on development  There are other large oil and gas companies operating in the Vaca Muerta  including Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa   and Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   But Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  says that YPF is  one of the most liquid investment vehicles for investors to get exposure to Argentina  
Also  the company has a high return on invested capital  according to Credit Suisse  a return that is better than Chevron  for example  YPF has a 6 percent rate of growth in terms of production  a figure that is closer to 14 percent when accounting for the acquisition of assets from Apache Corporation  NYSE APA  
For investors looking at Argentina s oil and gas investment opportunities  YPF could be the best bet

192031,413547,APA, The Need To knows Of Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  ,opinion,"Master Limited Partnerships  commonly referred to as MLPs are often viewed as a tax advantaged structure for an energy infrastructure company  While this definition is not inaccurate  it is an oversimplification of the MLP industry  Companies structured as partnerships  including MLPs  do not pay income tax at the company level  providing them a tax advantage by eliminating the double taxation of a corporate structure  Many MLPs  unlike most partnerships  are publicly listed companies that trade on major stock exchanges  As is required by all public companies  MLPs must make quarterly and annual reports  and file reports in regards to any material information that affects the business with the Securities Exchange Commission  SEC  
As of October 31  2014  there were over 115 publicly listed MLPs with a combined market capitalization of approximately  500 billion 
MLPs typically operate under a business model that follows one or more of the following 
Exploration and Production
The exploration and production business model  often called E P  involves searching for energy commodities such as crude oil  natural gas or coal  and bringing these commodities to the surface 

Processing

Processing MLPs  much like a processing company that focuses on agricultural commodities  focus on transforming the raw energy commodities into a usable form  This may involve turning oil into gasoline and petrochemicals  such as plastics and other petroleum based non energy goods   or simply cleaning the raw commodity by removing water and dirt  It could also involve separating the raw energy commodities into different qualities  for example  splitting natural gas into pipeline quality or natural gas liquids 

Storage

Storage MLPs do exactly what the name implies  they store energy  whether in its raw state  or post processing  Storage of energy can take many forms ranging from tanks to wells and from above ground to below ground  Storage MLPs provide energy companies economic flexibility  allowing them to control the supply of such commodities in order to maintain equilibrium  or close to equilibrium  with the demand for such commodities 

Transportation

As the name implies transportation MLPs transport or move the energy commodities from one place to another  Often this is done through pipelines from the wells to the processing facilities  but once processes the refined energy commodities must be moved  once again to a storage facility or to be sold on the market  In North America  the majority of energy transportation is conducted via pipelines  however trucks  ships and railcars are still used to transport both raw energy commodities and refined products 
Comparing MLPs to Traditional Companies
MLPs differ from traditional companies in a variety of ways  One of the most obvious ways that MLPs separate themselves from the broader universe of publicly traded companies is by solely focusing on the natural resources sector  Another common attribute of MLPs that differentiates themselves from the universe of traditional companies is that they pay no corporate income tax  and therefore are able to pay a larger portion of their earnings to their investors  Traditional  corporate structure  companies pay federal and state  if applicable  corporate income taxes 
The ownership structure of an MLP is quite different from that of a traditional corporate structure company  MLPs have two different categories of ownership  as with all limited partnerships  There are general partners or GPs and limited partners or LPs  The GPs ownership interest in MLPs can be held by an investment company or fund  by the management team individually  or by a holding company  as is most common  typically a major energy company  LPs can be in the form of an individual and investment fund or a holding company as well  however legally  LPs may only take  as the name implies  a very limited role in the operations and governance of the company  GPs handle and control the operations and management of the company  and they typically own a much smaller portion of the company than the combined ownership of LPs  Further  unlike other publicly traded  corporate structure or registered investment companies  GPs have no fiduciary duty to the LPs  meaning they do not have to legally act on behalf of the best interests of the LPs  Having said this however  incentives in MLPs and most partnerships are aligned as such that the best interests of the LP and the best interests of the GP are one in the same 
Due to their legal structure MLPs have significant differences with traditional companies when it comes to governance  In contrast with the GP   LP relationship  management teams of traditional companies are controlled 100  by the combined shareholders  While management and founders of the company may own significant shares in a traditional company  all owners have one vote per share they own  and major business decisions are typically made by both management and shareholders by voting on such matters  Further  management of a traditional corporation legally has a fiduciary duty to act on behalf of shareholders  although often the incentives between managements  interest and shareholders  interests are not necessarily aligned the way that they are in an MLP ownership structure 
The MLP Business Model
Most MLPs  excluding exploration   production MLPs  operate under a fee based business model  A fee based business model means regardless of the market price of the energy commodities being processed  transported or stored  MLPs receive a flat fee per ton of coal  barrel of oil or cubic foot of natural gas  This is often described as a  toll roads  model  due to the similarity to toll roads and their fee based model for using the roads  regardless of the type of car or cost of the car for that matter that is using the road  Further  for the sake of stability of their business model  and the ability to predict costs  MLPs often have extremely long term contracts with the clients  on average ranging from 5 to 50 years  with the latter being quite common 
As a result of their fee based  or toll road  business model predicting and or calculating the revenue for an MLP is elementary  For predicting MLP revenue  analysts and investors would simply multiply the fee for using the MLP infrastructure    per barrel of oil for example  by the expected volume of the energy commodities  For actual revenue  the same equation is applied  however instead of using expected volume analysts  investors or management would use actual volume 
For E P MLPs  the model is quite different  E P MLPs typically purchase and manage mature oil and gas wells that are still producing  or can very quickly start producing energy commodities  For E P MLPs profits are generated based on the amount of energy commodities they produce and the market price of said commodities  E P MLPs commonly use futures and options to hedge their exposure to price fluctuations in the energy commodities they are producing  allowing them to lock in certain prices for a specific period of time 
 Investor Benefits of MLPs
Investors in MLPs benefit from ownership when one or both of the two following occurs 

The MLP distributes cash  often referred to as dividends with traditional companies  in the form of distributions  Typically this is measured by dividing the nominal amount of the total annual distribution per share by the price of the share to determine what is known as the yield 

If the market prices of the MLP units increase to a price that is more than what the investor bought it for  the investor can sell and take a profit  commonly this is referred to as price appreciation 

Historical average yields for MLPs over the past decade or so has been 6 8   This means that if an investor held  100 of their portfolio in MLPs each year the investor would have received  on average   6 80 in distributions 

In comparison  Real Estate Investment Trusts and Utility stocks  two asset classes well known for their income producing potential and their high yield  have averaged approximately 4  yields per year over the same time period  Bonds and the S P 500 have averaged only 2  yields  approximately 
MLPs  unlike registered investment companies such as REITs and BDCs do not guarantee the distribution of a percentage of their cash flow or income each quarter  MLPs typically have within their partnership agreements a set or variable level of distributions that they attempt or intend to achieve  on average however  MLPs distribute between 80  and 100  of their cash flows 
MLP History
The history of publicly listed MLPs dates back to the early 1980s  During the 1980s  beginning with Apache Corporation  corporations  mostly energy and gas  but some notable non energy companies as well  began to aggressively restructure as MLPs  By the mid 1980s there were MLPs that were involved in everything from cable TV to amusement parks  As a result  congress began to see revenues from corporate taxes decrease significantly  In order to prevent corporate tax revenues from diminishing further Congress passed the Tax Reform act of 1986  subsequently President Raegan signed it into law  Not only did this law remove many of the tax shelters that existed at the time  it clearly defined the modern MLP structure 
Another act  the Revenue Act of 1987 limited businesses that could be structured and treated as MLPs as businesses that earn at least 90  of its gross income from  qualifying sources   strictly delineating those qualifying sources as transportation  processing  storage  and production of natural resources and minerals  In order to not anger any of the firms that took the time and underwent the expenses related to restructuring as an MLP were allowed to be  grandfathered  in and remain an MLP  however over the past 3 decades these companies have  for the most part  been converted to other structures or are no longer publicly traded 
MLPs  in the mid 1990s  had experienced a downturn in business and many of the original MLPs structured in the 80s were not able to maintain their cash distributions  As a result many of them stopped trading  In the same time frame  many of the real estate companies that had restructured as an MLP during the 80s converted to a REIT structure 
The MLP industry began to evolve in the early 2000s  with many MLPs buying  operating and maintain tanker ships  used for sea transportation  as well as storage tanks and tanker trucks used to transport and store propane  Also in the early 2000s  coal companies began converting their structure to MLPs  In the middle part of the first decade of the new millennium  due to all time highs and upward trends in oil and gas prices  exploration and production MLPs began to resurge 
Over the past 5 years  the use of hydraulic fracturing  commonly referred to as fracking  has led to a US energy renaissance  and in order to serve the companies that utilize fracking to unleash the enormous oil and gas reserves in the US  frac sand  a key component to fracking   natural resource marketing  and refining MLPs have come into existence  Since 2000  at least one new MLP has listed on major US stock exchanges every year except for in 2009  when there were no new MLP listings  In total  over the past 14 years 124 new MLPs have been listed and now trade publicly  that is an average of approximately 9 new MLPs per year since the turn of the millennium 
  The US Energy Infrastructure
Prior to World War II  the majority of energy transportation was conducted via tanker ships  most commonly transporting oil from the Middle East to refineries along the gulf coast  and then once refined  back to the east coast ports to be delivered to the major US cities  the largest regional consumers of energy  When the US military involved itself in WWII  Hitler s German Submarine fleets began attacking and sinking these tanker ships  The government  in cooperation with major energy companies  built a system of pipelines that were able to transport energy commodities over long distances 
These pipelines consisted of both large  trunklines   often as large as 42 inches in diameter  that transport energy to smaller pipelines  which connected to towns and cities as delivery lines 
The larger pipelines take in oil and gas products from many different sources  and when delivered to an end customer  the amount is the same  however the exact source of that product may be difficult to define as the energy product from multiple sources are combined in the pipelines  Smaller delivery pipelines however deliver the exact order from a specific source to the end customer 
The US Energy Boom
Technological advances have constantly changed human interaction and economic activity  often for the better but typically with some minor drawdowns  The internet made global communication much more efficient  smartphones and mobile internet access has increased the efficiency of many professionals  going back in time  industrialization of everything from agriculture to construction shifted the dynamic of both rural and urban life 
As the technological advances dramatically changed the lives of those living in developed nations  energy production technology in the US has significantly increased the country s capacity for producing energy commodities  The new technologies we speak of are hydraulic fracturing  fracking  and horizontal drilling 
For the past century  dating back to the last 1800s  vertical drilling was the only way to build an oil or gas well and harvest the earth s natural energy resources  Vertical drilling  as the name implies  consists of using an industrial drill to go straight into the ground and dig down to the pool of resources  Vertical drilling limited the amount of resources that energy production operations could harvest 
Horizontal drilling  as the name implies  allows the drill bit to make a 90 degree turn  usually once the depth of the well has been reached  and continue to drill horizontally  Instead of drilling many vertical wells  now energy companies can drill one vertical well  and then cut horizontally to other pools of natural resources in the area 
Fracking is a process that occurs after the well has been drilled  When the hole is dug  so to speak  the well is then lined with a protective casing  preparing it for the fracking process  Fracking uses a mixture of specific chemicals  sand and water which is then pumped  at an extremely high pressure  into the well to break up rock  The fracking process is very controversial  but is also very effective for unleashing energy resources that were not previously able to be harvested  These natural resources were previously unable to be harvested because they were trapped between layers of what is known as shale rock  While the applications of these technologies  widespread  are something that has only recently begun to occur  horizontal drilling has been around since the first half of the 20th century  Fracking has existed since the 1940s  and was first applied commercially in 1949  Natural gas companies were the first to apply these technologies across the industry in the early 2000s  however after seeing the potential profitability of the application of these technologies oil producers began utilizing horizontal drilling and fracking in the second half of the first decade of the 2000s 
As a result of the application of these technologies  oil and gas production has increased significantly  and is expected to continue to do so  Expectations are predicting an increase in natural gas and oil production of up to 55  from 2014 to 2040  with the majority of this increase resulting from shale gas production  The expected increase in shale gas production alone is over 100  during the same period 
One of the major results of the application of this technology is that the US is now the global leader in natural gas production  and is also projected to become the largest oil producer in the world by the end of 2014  Further  it is expected that the US  due to this boom in energy production  will become energy independent between 2020 to 2030  with some projections showing we will become net energy independent by 2016 and some as far out as 2040  The goal is to produce more oil and gas domestically than is consumed  allowing the US to become a major net exporter of energy commodities globally 

Global Growth in Demand for Energy
Countries around the world that were previously thought of as 3rd World nations are industrializing and rapidly advancing both socially and economically  The result is an increase in the demand for energy  These countries  using recycled technologies  primarily generate energy from coal plants  The result has been an increase in the exporting of coal and an increase in demand for coal  Historically  and currently coal has been and still is the largest source of energy production in the US  however natural gas power plants are becoming more popular due to their economic and environmental viability  Under the current political environment the use of coal is viewed as environmentally damaging  and the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has been appointed the responsibility of crafting and enforcing widespread regulations and standards aimed at reducing carbon pollution  this has increased the cost of operating coal power plants and the likelihood of the retirement of such plants 
Further  the demand for natural gas among petrochemical corporations has significantly increased  with many global and multinational companies moving their petrochemical operations to the US in an effort to capitalize on cheap natural gas domestically  The increase in the supply of natural gas has led to the development of what are known as gas to liquid  GTL  plants  GTL plants convert natural gas into liquid forms of fuel such as gasoline or diesel  Currently there are no GTL plants operating in the US  however the development of such plants are being planned due to the abundant supply of natural gas domestically  typically these liquid fuels are refined from crude oil  however the potential to turn natural gas into liquid fuels may soon be a reality 
Due to globalization and global industrialization  the demand for energy has skyrocketed the past two decades  As a result of both the increase in demand for energy globally as well as the abundant supply of cheap natural gas in the US  companies in the US are now exporting natural gas for the first time ever  and the exports of liquefied petroleum gas  LPGs  are at all time record highs 
How MLPs Benefit from Supply   Demand for Energy
While some MLPs are involved in exploration and production  the majority of MLPs are not the firms taking on the massive risks involved in drilling and utilizing the new technologies leading to the energy boom in the US  Instead  MLPs provide the services that these E P firms require to move their products from field to refinery  to store their products prior to sale  and to refine their products into the final good that will be sold to consumers  MLPs that provide the transportation  processing and storage for the abundant supply of oil and natural gas coming to market benefit significantly from the expansion of US energy production  without the high risks involved with drilling new wells 
As a result of the US energy boom and the abundance of supply of oil and natural gas massive new energy infrastructure will need to be built throughout North America  and primarily in the US  The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America  INGAA  released a study in 2014 that projected and quantified the amount of new infrastructure that would be needed by 2035  The INGAA study claims that over  640 billion  or approximately  30billion or more per year  As discussed in the  Introduction to MLPs  topic  the current market size  measured by market cap  of MLPs is approximately  500billion  According to the INGAA  that market will need to increase by approximately 128  over the next 20 years 
According to Alerian  the largest MLP focused index company  the MLP space is expected to grow 10  12  annually long term  This assumption is based on no meaningful price appreciation  but rather is based on an assumption of a 6  annual yield and distribution growth of 4  6  per year  The growth numbers they project are based on incremental construction of new assets to support the US energy boom 
The Risks of MLPs
Understanding the risks of any investment is one of the main factors to long term success as an investor 
Interest Rate Risk   MLPs are high yield investments  due to this historically MLPs have been perceived by the market  and subsequently trade similar to other yield investments such as bonds  utilities or REITs  This subjects yield assets to being analyzed in comparison to government bonds  commonly 10 year treasury bonds   Analysts and investors use a measurement called the yield spread to make this comparison  The yield spread is the difference in the yield of an asset class  such as MLPs and the yield on government bonds  US Government bonds are considered risk free  as such  the yield spread typically defines the additional risk that investors are willing to accept in return for a higher yield  Yield moves inverse to price  therefore if interest rates on government bonds increase  and investors demand the same yield spread to MLPs  the price of MLPs will decline  There is some historical evidence that indicates MLP prices do not respond positively to announcements of a rise in interest rates  Over the long term however  as interest rate increases are typically correlated to an increase or expected increase in inflation  revenues of MLPs tend to increase in line with inflation  and therefore as do dividend distributions made by MLPs  which can potentially mitigate the effect on price depreciation of MLPs due to a rise in interest rates 
Commodity Pricing Risks   The price of commodities typically does not correlate directly to the price of most MLPs  however for E P MLPs and refining MLPs the price of energy commodities does directly affect revenue and earnings  For other MLP business models  commodity price volatility or changes in supply and or demand that leads to commodity price volatility can have indirect effects on revenue  earnings and pricing of MLP securities  For example  if energy commodity prices increase significantly consumers are likely to decrease their energy consumption  this will in turn lead to a lower demand for transportation and storage of energy commodities  and thus effect the revenue of MLPs  and vice versa  The psychology of market participants may  due to the business models of MLPs  determine there is a connection between the success of MLPs and energy commodity prices without considering the effects of higher supply and lower energy commodity prices in regards to the business model of MLPs 
Environmental Risk   Much of the energy infrastructure currently in place in the US is aging  Pipelines  in particular those built in major transportation corridors were designed and built most prevalently in the 1950s and 1960s  Further  in the past decade or so there have been a couple of highly controversial oil spills that were covered excessively by the mainstream media  The combination of high profile spills and an aging pipeline system has raised some concern in regards to environmental implications and thus has raised concern among investors in regards to potential regulatory changes that may add financial burdens to MLPs  Having said that  pipeline transportation is by far the safest way to transport energy commodities  According to a presentation given by Cheryl Trench at the April 2012 API Pipeline Conference  titled  Improving Liquid Pipeline Safety  Signposts from the Record   pipeline transport is 34x safer than transportation by road  Further  due to advancements in technology that allow from more accurate and frequent monitoring in pipelines  the number of spills per 1 000 miles  the standard measurement for pipeline spills  have decreased by 60  over the past decade  and the number of barrels released during the pipeline transportation process has decreased by approximately 42  over the same time period 
Legislative Risks   The environmental risks listed above can often carry over into the category of legislative or regulatory risk  Government actions are often dictate by public opinion  Currently public opinion in regards to many important aspects of the MLP business models are mixed  particularly in regards to the subject of Hydraulic Fracturing  Fracking   The potential environmental risks are constantly being weighed against the potential economic benefits  Fracking is the subject of much debate  such debate has already lead to certain changes in the regulatory environment  For example  in the state of California and in New York State  fracking is banned  as it is in parts of Europe  If fracking bans occur in other states in the US or potentially federally  it could potentially damage the MLP business  The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy   Interior are currently conducting a joint study on the safety of fracking and how it potentially effects drinking water  This is the result of mixed claims that fracking may or may not contaminate ground water resources  Other claims that lead to the debate of the safety of fracking is whether or not fracking has an effect on tectonic plates and whether or not it can potentially cause more frequent earthquakes 
Potential regulatory risks  unfortunately  are not the only legislative risks surrounding MLPs  Due to the tax advantaged structure of MLPs they have become wildly popular  particularly among investors seeking stable tax advantaged income  Historically speaking however  changes in the tax structure and particularly that of MLPs has been changed before  If there is public sentiment that urges the government to eliminate what are perceived as tax loopholes  it is possible that the MLP tax structure may be legislatively eliminated  While the precedent for such sweeping changes do exist  due to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East  the historical dependence on Middle Eastern oil supplies  a perceived economic advantage of becoming energy independent in regards to both these conflicts as well as global economic competitiveness  and the need for significant energy infrastructure investment if such independence is to become reality  the likelihood of tax regime changes in regards to MLPs is in our opinion low  Though the likelihood of this type of change in tax policies is low  it must be considered ",2014-12-08,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-need-to-knows-of-master-limited-partnerships-(mlps)-234925,234925
192032,413548,APA,Blackbird s Braun  Leadership  Foresight And Natural Gas,opinion,"When an energy company has grown its share price more than 400  against strong headwinds in one year  that s an attention getter  The formula  as always  is to get the right management  after which value will be created and growth will follow  CEO Garth Braun of Blackbird Energy Inc   TO BBI  has made sweet lemonade out of a sour market in fossil fuels  In this interview with The Energy Report  Braun describes his business model and talks about his management and leadership style 
The Energy Report  Garth  a year ago  Blackbird Energy was a true penny stock  You were trading at about CA 0 07 share and your market valuation was below CA 11 million  CA 11M   Today your market cap is about CA 120M  How did you create so much shareholder value with energy prices plummeting 
Garth Braun  Let me start with the issue of falling energy prices  Blackbird is  at present  agnostic to commodity prices  Due to nonmaterial revenue generated from our noncore assets  we don t see the current commodity price environment as a negative  but rather as an opportunity to grow even faster  Because of that  we are not making our decisions based on cash flow fluctuations 
When we went out to raise capital in fall 2014  we attracted numerous institutions that deployed capital into Blackbird because of our ability to execute not just on drilling  but also on land capture and solving infrastructure issues  To put this in the simplest terms  we are able to grow the company and move it forward 
Our Elmworth Block where we are in the midst of testing our first two Montney wells will not have production tied in until later this year  Q4 15 or Q1 16   if they prove as prospective as we believe  That s our core focus  and where we are delineating and derisking a very large contiguous block of land  up to 24 sections 
TER  I see that you have recently acquired an additional 11 sections of Elmworth Montney properties  for a total of 47 sections  In addition  you ve acquired 77 sections of East Wapiti Montney land  as well as four more sections of Elmworth Montney properties that are noncontiguous with current Elmworth Montney properties  How much do you own  Do you have it all to yourself 
GB  We own a 100  working interest on all lands  The 11 sections of contiguous lands purchased in October and November amount to 6 710 net acres  and our 47 section contiguous block amounts to 30 080 net acres 
TER  Garth  tell me how you ve been creating value  You ve gotten a good deal on your land  haven t you  You must have gotten in early 
GB  Yes  indeed  The first step was to execute land purchases below market  We were able to do that because we were early movers in mapping the Elmworth corridor  and subsequently in purchasing land in what we determined was a liquids rich corridor  At the time the play was in its infancy  with producers focusing on the dryer  westerly land  This allowed Blackbird to implement a proprietary land acquisition strategy that effectively blocks larger producers from acquiring contiguous land positions  We were able to get a toehold in the corridor 
Second  through our drilling program  we are able to validate and capture contiguous lands not being drilled by industry leaders  A significant producer in the area recently acquired lands approximately three miles from our land position for  2 9M per section  the company acquired 12 net sections for  35M   which we see as a significant acquisition for that company  Our vice president exploration  Craig Wiebe  views this industry leader s land and Blackbird s to be geologically the same  To date  Blackbird has paid approximately CA 5 7M for all 128 sections  or approximately CA 45 000  CA 45K  per section  That works out to approximately CA 110K per section for its 47 contiguous Elmworth sections  and CA 315K per section for the recent 11 section purchase  The reason we have been able to acquire the land at what appears to be significantly discounted prices is  again  because we have been able to use our drilling program to validate lands that would otherwise expire 
After drilling and completion  D C  costs on our first two Elmworth wells  we anticipate having CA 27M of working capital with which we can comfortably drill two more wells and build a battery  We look to drill up to four more wells by the end of 2015 if we have access to additional capital on share price strength  which will allow us to accelerate our capital expenditure  capex  program and enter a phase of self sustaining growth 
TER  You currently have a very strong balance sheet  with about CA 42M in cash and no debt  I understand that each Elmworth well will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of CA 10M to drill and complete  How long can your existing cash fund your operation  Will it last through the current operating year 
GB  The funds on hand would allow Blackbird to drill two more wells and fund infrastructure  We plan to have the wells tied in by late 2015 or Q1 16  That being said  post positive results from our first two wells  we would look to raise further funds to facilitate a more aggressive drill program of up to six wells drilled and completed by Q4 15 
The question that should really be asked is not how long we can survive with our current cash on hand  but whether we have the ability to access additional capital to grow and accelerate our plans  To that question I can say  unequivocally  that if results are positive on these first two wells  our team will have the ability to raise capital and grow  which is what I believe investors need to know  We don t believe that staying still yields any utility or value  and thus our duty to shareholders is to continue our path of growth and delineation 
TER  There are some much bigger companies operating near your Elmworth properties specifically Encana Corporation  NYSE ECA   NuVista Energy Ltd   TO NVA   Apache Corp   Royal Dutch Shell A  BA RDS  and Canadian Natural Resources Limited  NYSE CNQ   My understanding is that they have been successful in the area  Do you imagine that Blackbird investors think of these larger companies as potential acquirers 
GB  I had a discussion recently with a reserve engineer  and he gave me his opinion that only 5  of projects in Canada were economic at this time  I think we need to widen the field as to the companies that are interested in Blackbird s project 
As for Blackbird being a potential takeover target  even though companies have begun to batten down the hatches on capex  it should not go unmentioned that many large companies currently have less than stellar economic plays  During this down cycle in commodities  certain companies will inevitably decide to redeploy capital to the resources with the highest economic returns  Some will go one step further acquiring companies with established positions in areas where highly economic plays still exist  With Blackbird targeting the high liquids window in the Montney  a potential acquirer has an ability to take control of a large contiguous position in what is turning into a highly economic resource  one that is able to create value at these lower commodity prices  Furthermore  with cash on hand and no debt  Blackbird appears to be that much more attractive  A takeover is not so much a question of whether it happens  but when it will happen 
What Has Propelled Blackbird Energy Stocks So Dramatically Braun Sums It Up
The vision to build a liquids rich play  which Blackbird would own 100  of  that would have a scale that would be significant to institutional investors and would be in a corridor where drilling would be proceeding toward our lands  so that we could use other people s money to derisk and delineate the resource 
We were early to the play  We needed to capture acquire the lands prior to prices increasing beyond our ability to pay  We have paid for our total contiguous 47 sections of land  approximately  5 2M or CA 110K per section  Other companies have paid substantially more up to  2 9M per section 
We acquired land when the market thought it could not be done at affordable prices  and when we selected our well locations  we looked for multiple benefits  We not only wanted to prove up the upper and the middle Montney  we also wanted to capture 11 more sections of land adjacent to where we were drilling  These lands cost us less than CA 315K per section 
Economies of scale  This project is based in three zones  four wells per zone  which would potentially have up to 564 well locations  The size of the prize is substantial  The multiple zones are being delineated by Encana  NuVista  CNRL  and soon by Apache and Shell 
We can be a low cost supplier  A liquid rich project  having wells that produce greater than 50 bbl MMcf of gas  is very economic  and would result in Blackbird being a low cost supplier 
We continued to build a high quality team that would allow the company to execute its strategy 
We unlocked stranded value through disposition of a noncore asset  generating  8 9M net 
We have a leading completion program that maximizes complex fracturing of the Montney  The completion program was designed to maximize liquids recovery  while reducing the risk of completion failure 
Investors  including institutional funds  bought into our vision and execution strategy  and into the unrealized potential value of our Elmworth Montney Project 
Finally  we have torque  We have a catalyst driven story  We have met and achieved significant catalysts to date  and we have several more catalysts in the near term  one being the announcement of the results of our first two Montney wells 
TER  Blackbird got an average price of  65 per barrel of oil equivalent   65 boe  in the quarter ending October 31  2014  versus  71 79 boe in the three months ending Oct  31  2013  exclusive of royalties  How will you manage in the current environment 
GB  The production you are referencing is from our Saskatchewan project  which is not material to our overall operations  The main project for Blackbird is Elmworth  and I will answer your question in the context of the two wells we just completed and will be testing this month 
At current commodity prices  which are approximately  50 per barrel   50 bbl  for oil and  3 per million cubic feet   3 MMcf  for gas  and based on numerous internally generated economic runs utilizing production rates that mirror results on trend  we still would achieve internal rates of return  IRR  greater than 15  and an economic ultimate recovery of approximately 1M boe  This puts Blackbird in the 5  of economic projects per above  The caveat is that these assumptions must be proven by production results 
This all boils down to reaching our goal of becoming a low cost supplier of energy to the market  which effectively means we can turn a profit at these lower commodity prices  But when prices begin to rebound  they will have a major impact on increased profitability  It is the types of projects based on higher liquids yields 75 bbl MMcf or greater that have the ability to weather shocks to prices and to flourish in more  normal  environments  Once again  I reiterate that these assumptions must be proven by production results 
TER  Production normally progresses with a sense of urgency  With energy prices currently so low  are you in a big hurry to produce  Are you trying to time production to higher prices 
GB  At the moment  with our commodity price agnostic view  we are quite happy these wells are not able to be tied in immediately  Regardless  we do have some work to do before the tie in can occur  First we have to build a battery that can handle the volume of high liquids associated with these wells  and then we have to tie into a pipeline  We see this all being completed by Q4 15 or Q1 16  We see this timeline as positioning the company exceptionally well for a rebound in commodity prices 
TER  What forecasts are you using for oil this year  You must be thinking of some dollar amount 
GB  We are taking a more conservative view regarding gross domestic product  GDP  growth  oil supply and oil demand  We see a U shaped recovery versus a V shaped recovery  meaning we think low prices will not lead to a sharp uptick midyear  but rather a slower  more gradual realization of higher oil prices stabilizing in the  70 bbl range come 2016  which is in line with many reserve engineering firms in Calgary  We believe that we are not only dealing with an oversupplied market  but we are also in a world environment where GDP growth is not going to be at the pace we have seen over the last 10 years  Furthermore  capex in the oil sector is being cut  but producers are utilizing this reduced capital to drill in their sweet spots  which will limit any supply reductions in the immediate term 
TSLR  With your market cap above CA 100M  Blackbird shares must be attracting attention from institutional investors who could not buy micro cap stocks  Do you have any idea currently what percentage of your outstanding shares are owned by institutions  To your way of thinking  does institutional buying mean the next strong leg up for Blackbird shares 
GB  Blackbird actually began to attract institutional ownership before we hit a market cap of CA 100M  In the fall  when we raised approximately CA 37M of capital  institutional buying represented approximately CA 30M of the total  At the time of that raise  we were trading at approximately a CA 60M market cap  Today our institutional ownership is between 35  and 40   and is probably still increasing as more investment banks begin to cover our company with research  We do believe this institutional support will give us a new leg up 
Once we have completed our first two Montney wells  we will get a revised reserve report prepared  This will allow us to begin the process of graduating to the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX   which we believe will allow further institutional ownership to occur and enable another leg up in value for Blackbird 
TER  Do you foresee having to go back to the market in early 2016 
GB  Raising capital is not bad for existing shareholders if the capital is used to build value  Over the past year  I think we showed the market that our capital raises enhanced and accelerated our growth trajectory  The capital we ve raised has put us in an enviable position with a strong balance sheet consisting of cash on hand and no debt 
Post the drilling of our two wells  if they come out with positive results  we will have to make the decision on whether we want to accelerate our growth  Certain institutional holders in Blackbird stock have made it very clear that they want us to continue on the path of growth through the drill bit and land aggregation  and would be very comfortable deploying capital into us so that we remain relevant and strong in periods of opportunity 
TER  Your stock performance over the past 52 weeks is stunning  considering such a challenging environment  That says something about management  What do you think sets you apart from other CEOs 
GB  First  I would say no company gets created because of the CEO  It gets created because of the team  One thing I can tell you is that I ve been very fortunate to have aggregated a very  very good team  What I ve given them is leadership  This has not been about cheerleading  it s leadership based on work ethic  It s one thing to get out and be a cheerleader  but it s another thing entirely to develop a team that is executing on a solid  strategic plan  I want our team to differentiate what we were and what we are about to be  We were previously a micro cap  and we are rapidly becoming a junior  as we drill and complete these first two wells  Each day  when I speak to my team  the No  1 thing I say is to strive for perfection and deliver excellence in everything we do 
TER  Garth  give me an example that would give investors an idea what that strategy means in the real world  in terms of executing on something tangible 
GB  In the last two months  as we ve seen commodity prices roll back  some of our suppliers have actually extended their payment schedules for us  moving it out as far as 120 days  They are trying to be accommodating during tough times  I met with my team three weeks ago and said  in an environment like this  where you have commodity prices moving back and suppliers potentially feeling the pinch of delayed receivables coming in  I want to convert to a 15 day payment schedule  Now  we have to make sure that there is firm and final agreement on the payables  but the message I m sending to the marketplace is that if you do business with Blackbird  you re going to be paid in a timely fashion  and that we want premium their best pricing as we go forward and on current accounts  I m getting every single team member to focus on the details and making everything we do exceptional  That s what makes a company successful 
Cycling  Braun s Obsession  Not His Hobby
In December  Garth Braun finished 355th out of 72 000 riders in total distance on Strava  a cycling social network  online training log and competition  for the month of December    When you re developing an oil company  you can t just forecast that oil is going to stay above  100 bbl   he says   When you re out cycling and you re going out for a 180 kilometer ride  if you expect that it s only going to be flat and the wind is going to be at your back  you are na ve   Braun rode Doi Inthanon in Northern Thailand  It climbs 47km over 2 400 meters  and cycling enthusiasts agree it s a brutal ride   It took me 3 hours and 35 minutes to get to the top  Once you re on it  it only gets more difficult to the point that slopes are up to about 24 degrees  If you re not leaning down onto your handlebars  the bike will lift up and do an involuntary wheelie  It s that steep  and there s no option  You can t even turn around and go downhill because you ll get a flat tire applying the brakes so much  So you have to get to the top so that someone can load you in a vehicle and take you down  Once you start riding  you re committed  That s how I see the oil and gas business  and that s how I see Blackbird  We ve committed to making a company successful  We ve put our heads down  and we re going to get to the top  
TER  You have to maintain relationships for decades to keep and hire the best people  Do you start leadership training with your people the moment they come in to the company 
GB  Absolutely  In fact  I ll tell you something  There are three young gentlemen who recently joined the company  When I interviewed each of them  I said   One of the most important things for you to do is take a leadership role in my company   I told each one   I m a mentor to you  I want you to have expectations and goals  and to achieve those goals  When I say I m going to mentor you  that means you re going to get a lot more feedback from me than if you were just an employee who had a job to do   I m not looking for a person to join my company and do a job  I want to give them the skills to become industry leaders  So  there s a greater burden here  and you have to be prepared when you join 
TER  Investors want to know about milestones that could move shares  Could you summarize the catalysts investors might look to 
GB  One near term catalyst is the completion of  and announcement of results from  our first two wells in the Elmworth area  being our midland and upper Montney wells  But even prior to that  I think investors should be aware that as CEO of the company  I have been actively recruiting coverage or initiation of coverage on Blackbird by a number of financial institutions  We want to have more eyes on our company  more institutions to be aware of us  and more independent analysts to have formed their own opinions on Blackbird s assets and where the company will go  I think  even prior to announcement of our well results  you will see institutions beginning to initiate more coverage on Blackbird 
Next  I think you will see the results from our first two wells  Once the wells are completed  you ll see me proceed immediately to have those wells reserved  Third  once I get that reserve report  we ll announce the result  and that will be the last remaining requirement for us to make application to move from the Toronto Stock Exchange Venture  TSX V  exchange to the TSX  which is the big board in Canada  That s critical  because it opens up a whole new corridor of institutions that may be limited to investing only in TSX companies  Once you re on the big time board  you re open for them to evaluate and invest in you 
TER  Garth  thank you  It s been a pleasure

192033,413549,APA,Weekly Energy,opinion,Prices for WTI and Brent crude rose for a third week in a row  up 2 2  and 6 4   respectively  These increases led to a significant jump in prices for refined products such as gasoline and diesel Since the markets closed on January 30  2015  the price of diesel traded in New York  in USD gallon  has risen 22 6   The increase was more modest when measured in Canadian dollars  14 3   We see this as a very positive sign  and believe that the worst of the crisis is now behind us  While the markets may still be highly volatile  we believe that the current situation represents a good opportunity to implement hedges On Thursday  Apache  NYSE APA  announced that it will pull 70  of its drilling rigs out of operation by the end of the month  Apache now expects that output will be flat  in contrast to the 12  growth forecast it made just last November when it published results  This announcement was well received by analysts  who believe that investment cutbacks may curtail growth in U S  output sooner than previously expected ,2015-02-17,The National Bank of Canada,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekly-energy-242158,242158

192046,413562,APA,Can Gas Developers Prosper With Low Prices  Ryan Galloway Says Yes,opinion,Low natural gas prices and volatile oil prices should not hinder investors in the oil and gas sector  In fact  low prices carry their own benefits  Casimir Capital Analyst Ryan Galloway describes a number of oil and gas juniors with savvy management  impressive development strategies and strong prospects of success that have earned a  Strong Buy  from him  Read more in this Energy Report interview  The Energy Report  Petroleum prices are largely set by the world market because the product is easily transported via tankers  but natural gas is still regionally priced  Could the development of more liquefied natural gas  LNG  plants in North America affect gas prices  Ryan Galloway  If more LNG facilities come online in key areas  that will help to reduce regional differentials from excess regional supply  For example  the Kitimat project would be extremely helpful for Montney and Horn River gas in Northeast British Columbia Northwest Alberta  But a broad  rapid  North America wide increase in gas prices would still be tricky  A gradual price uptick paired with more stability and reduced differentials is far more likely  Over the last few years  a lot of the North American producers have managed to bring down costs and focus on liquids rich gas plays  and they re doing OK despite low gas prices  TER  Does the U S  shale gas production threaten gas producers in Canada  RG  A lot of that impact has already been felt  U S  shale gas production really started to accelerate in 2008  Last summer  major gas price lows triggered a lot of  release valves   including coal to gas switching  At peak times  we saw 8 10 billion cubic feet per day  Bcf d  in incremental demand  There has been more industrial demand growth as well  If prices do start to decline  that should create enough marginal demand to avoid shutting out gas producers  On the flip side  if gas prices rally quite hard  we could see a reversal on that coal to gas situation  Longer term  I see fairly stable prices and a gradual uptick  but I don t see the Canadians getting shut out  TER  Which oil and gas companies could benefit from an increase in prices  RG  All of the oil and gas companies benefit quite nicely  But for the gas weighted players I have under coverage  I like Crocotta Energy Inc   CTA TSX   Crocotta is a lean and mean gas producer with  5 6 barrel of oil equivalent   5 6 boe  total costs and netbacks around  20 boe despite having a 65  gas weighting  It has also grown production about 300  since 2010  In addition to core acreage at Edson  it has a very solid position in the Montney with over 35 net sections where we should see a lot more development in H2 13  A lot of its wells boast 100   internal rates of return  so if gas pricing improves  a lot of these could go from being good assets to fantastic assets  Bellatrix Exploration Ltd   BXE TSX  is another large  gas weighted player  also about 65 70  gas  It should see positive support to cash flow  est  at  1 69 share  going forward if pricing improves  What people forget about Bellatrix is its significant Duvernay acreage  It has over 300 potential future wells in the Duvernay needing a  3 5B investment  There s massive potential for Bellatrix on its Duvernay acreage in the event of a gradual improvement to gas prices  Outside my coverage  I also like Yoho Resources Inc   YO TSX V   It s a junior that s also leveraged to the Duvernay and Montney  It is an early mover in Duvernay and partners with Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE  and Trilogy Energy Corp   TET TSX   TER  Bellatrix Exploration s website describes its strategy as  drilling  development and targeted acquisition   Does it have the balance sheet to support this strategy  RG  We see Bellatrix having an all in  net debt position around  260 million   260M  at the end of 2013  We see that as very manageable at just over 1x exit cash flow rates  It definitely has the cash flow to support a level of debt to continue drilling  With its latest Korean joint venture  Bellatrix also got access to third party capital  bringing in about  150M from the Koreans to accelerate Cardium development  TER  How is the company handling the fast growth it has experienced since 2009  RG  Bellatrix has done it pretty intelligently  In 2012  in advance of this production  the company talked about getting infrastructure in place  That included an 18 kilometer pipeline across the North Saskatchewan River to get access to a couple of plants in the area the Alder Flats shallow cut plant  where there s about 15 million cubic feet per day  15 MMcf d  capacity  and the Keyera Facilities Income Fund  KEY UN TSX  Minnehik Buck Lake plant  which has about 100 MMcf d unused capacity  A lot of that infrastructure is in place to allow it to grow this production quickly  It is also optimizing its efficiency by doing more pad drilling  TER  Are the gas producers expecting to maximize their returns in the wholesale gas market or in LNG  RG  It s a bit of a mix  Given that U S  and Canadian production is around 77 Bcf d currently  there won t be enough LNG offtake for that  The producers will benefit indirectly from LNG sales operated by other majors  LNG is extremely capital intensive  so the bigger guys will be involved and have some of the option value  Regionally  smaller players will benefit indirectly from the pricing on the wholesale market  TER  Can geography make a big difference in a company s profitability  Can a company like Sterling Resources Ltd   SLG TSX V  take advantage of the European desire to free itself from dependence on Russian natural gas because of its location in Western Europe and Romania  RG  Yes  Sterling Resources has quite a good gas weighted portfolio  especially in the U K  as well as in Romania  That should really help it in terms of its ability to take advantage of high European gas prices  In the U K   for example  we ve seen prices as high as  11 per thousand cubic feet   11 Mcf  on some forward contracts  Sterling s core asset is an offshore asset called Breagh  set to come online this August  That will add about 45 54 MMcf d net  That will make Sterling hugely leveraged to high U K  natural gas prices  Going forward  Romania is a big deal for Sterling as well  where they have a lot of discoveries offshore  In late 2013 and 2014  the company plans to conduct additional exploration and appraisal to help prove what it s quoting as a  gas hub  around existing discoveries known as Ana and Doina  You can put together those two offshore Romania gas discoveries with numerous other prospects in the area  build gas infrastructure and then pipe that onshore  The nice thing is that historically  Romania has had price regulation that keep gas prices in the high  3 Mcf range  but as a member of the European Union  EU   it has been getting a bit of pressure to allow free market pricing to prevail  Laws passed very recently are going to put pricing toward the  10 Mcf range by 2018 and probably sooner on the industrial side  Prices there are set to increase rapidly  and there are good gas discoveries and additional prospects to appraise and explore in offshore Romania  The issue for Sterling is just prioritizing which ones it wants to go after first  TER  Palliser Oil   Gas Corp   PXL TSX V  ships an increasing percentage of its heavy oil by rail  Is its operating efficiency enough to offset the premium it pays for that  RG  Absolutely  Palliser is a heavy oil producer and we ve seen fairly large differentials on heavy oil this year  While Palliser hasn t disclosed figures on what kind of incremental benefit it gets from rail  we re estimating that depending on the differentials it is experiencing  it could get between  6 15 barrel   6 15 bbl  in improved netbacks  Even a small change to that netback is quite material to the overall cash flow for the company  Other heavy oil operators have needed to get additional equipment on some of their oil batteries to reduce the amount of water in their oil to meet rail specifications  but Palliser actually installed a lot of that equipment in the first place  which helped the company save money in the long run  TER  When the Whiting refinery comes online  how will that affect Palliser s share price  RG  Whiting is fairly important for heavy oil producers because that upgrade will increase the capacity for heavy crude  currently around 20  of its throughput  up to 85   That will bring on about 420 thousand barrels per day  which should help to alleviate some of the oil differential we re seeing between heavy and lighter blends in Alberta  It should help to improve cash flows for the company  and hopefully share price appreciation will follow  TER  Is Iona Energy Inc  s  INA TSX V  focus on the North Sea permanent  or is it just a springboard to future expansion elsewhere  RG  Management at Iona is well experienced in the U K  North Sea  Neill Carson and Brad Gunn  Iona s CEO and CFO  were also founders of Ithaca Energy Inc   IAE TSX   another successful offshore U K  player  and the rest of the management team is very experienced in U K  offshore  It makes sense for them to go after the assets that they know  and they ve done a good job of it so far  Iona s game plan in the past has been to secure smaller fields that have been ignored by the larger players  and do this at discounted costs  and then get them developed and tied back into existing facilities  This minimizes its infrastructure risk and minimizes delays associated with building new infrastructure  So we see it continuing with a U K  focus for the foreseeable future  The key asset it just acquired  Huntington  is likely going to be onstream imminently  Then it is going to continue with U K  development of an asset called Orlando  which should bring on about 7 500 barrels per day oil net in late 2014  Kells in 2015 and then another asset called West Wick to follow  I see Iona advancing with quite a good pipeline of development oriented assets in the U K  for the next few years  What I like about Iona is that  by 2014  it could be putting out nearly  0 90 share in cash flow versus where it s currently trading  around  0 68 share  This could be a story that really takes off again  TER  TAG Oil Ltd   TAO TSX V  website notes that two Canadian independents  Addax Petroleum  AXC TSX  and Tanganyika Oil Company Ltd   TYK TSX V   were acquired by Chinese majors  Is TAG looking for a buyer  RG  Everyone is potentially for sale for the right price  What TAG is looking to do in the near term is advance its East Coast shale prospects in New Zealand  It is a massive unconventional oil resource play  and TAG is looking to drill that imminently to see what kind of oil shale potential it has on the East Coast  I think it wants to see how that goes before it even considers selling the company  because there s huge value there  Apache Corp   APA NYSE  recently exited the joint venture for reasons unrelated to technical feasibility of the shale  TAG has already gotten other interest from parties that might be looking to establish a new joint venture  But I think TAG wants to see what it has before looking at any other options  because it s pretty confident in the potential of oil shale in New Zealand  TER  What is TAG s reason for focusing on exploration and production in New Zealand  RG  New Zealand has conventional production but also huge unconventional potential on the East Coast  So when management was first getting into New Zealand  it had a view that conventional supplies worldwide were approaching a peak and there was a need to look for unconventional resources worldwide  We had started to see horizontal  multistage frack technology in North America  So the expectation was if you could find some interesting assets globally  especially in a politically safe jurisdiction like New Zealand and that is closer to demand centers like Southeast Asia  then you could have potential to develop an unconventional resource base  That s what TAG likes there  The resource assessment it got for East Coast was pointing to 12 billion barrels  12 Bbbl   so it s a huge prize  TER  Share prices for both TAG and Sterling have fallen over the last year  What makes them strong buys  in your opinion  RG  First of all  big conventional production is finally arriving  TAG has behind pipe oil and gas wells that need to be tied in  We ve been waiting a little while to get that in place  but we hear that it s ready to rock and roll and move forward with a big production ramp up  currently from around 2 million barrels oil equivalent per day  2 Mboe d  to between 4 6 Mboe d  Second  TAG is advancing on the East Coast shale with a likely spud date in late April or early May for the first vertical stratigraphic well  So if it sees the oil that it s expecting  that could be absolutely massive for the stock  Once you ve drilled a few shale wells to delineate the resource  a large area becomes very prospective for additional shale oil drilling and development  The last reason that TAG is a strong buy is that this summer it is also likely to be drilling a deep gas condensate prospect called Cardiff  Based on what other operators have seen in the same formation nearby  Cardiff could have the potential to be a 30 MMcf d producer  There is significant upside to the stock in multiple areas over the next few months  As for Sterling  it has just raised  63M to improve its financing situation  Sterling still needs to work out a few details on its lending facility to unlock the Breagh cash flow  but I m confident it can renegotiate the terms successfully  Breagh plus the Romanian assets and the other assets it has in its portfolio should provide additional value going forward  That s why we re pretty positive on Sterling s prospects longer term  now that it has come out of the challenges it had earlier this year  TER  Any final parting thoughts you d like to share  RG  There are good quality domestic names  but at some point  I think the internationals are going to attract interest as well  We ve had a very risk off environment in the past year  That could gradually improve in 2013  With the oil differentials in place  uncertainty on oil pricing in North America from pipeline bottlenecks and the Alberta budget situation adding uncertainty on the royalty and tax side  it s very plausible that you could start to see internationals looking more competitive  with very interesting risk return profiles  TER  Ryan  thank you very much for your time today  RG  Thank you very much   joined Casimir

192047,413563,APA,What Every Investor Should Know About Oil and Gas Micro Caps,opinion,Atticus Lowe was among those who saw more smoke than fire in the fevered puffery of the shale industry s promoters  With an established track record now  the industry has proved its potential for him  and he is bullish on gas over the long term  He shares his assessment of some of the promising oil and gas players in this interview with The Energy Report  The Energy Report  A couple of years ago  you were skeptical of the long term prospects of the U S  shale gas plays being touted by producers  Has anything happened to give you more confidence in the forecasts  Atticus Lowe  Commercial production has been established in a number of shale plays  although most require a significantly higher natural gas price to justify the economics  As these shale plays have developed  a number of sweet spots have been established that provide higher than average returns  This is the old 80 20 rule  where 80  of the production may come from 20  of the acreage  The sweet spots in some of these plays are economically viable in the current price environment  but the vast majority of the acreage in most of these plays will require at least  5 per thousand cubic feet   5 Mcf  in order to make them work  I m surprised by how well natural gas production has held up in the face of very low prices over the past few years  Early on in the history of shale development  prices were multiples of where they currently are  so the economics worked and people were excited about it  paying high prices for the acreage  A lot of producers curtailed production when prices dropped  and a lot of that production has come back onto the market  now that prices have recovered a bit  Probably the biggest factor  though  is the natural gas byproduct that is associated with the liquids rich shale plays  In the Marcellus shale play  for example  the producers make their money on the liquids  and they can practically give away the gas and still make money on their drill programs  That has resulted in a lot of extra natural gas supply  which has really kept prices tempered  But natural gas liquids prices are getting pressured pretty hard  so some of that drilling is slowing down  Over the last few weeks  domestic production has actually started to decline  Winter weather has been cold  compared to last year especially  so we re actually slightly below the five year average in terms of natural gas storage  When you combine that with the recent declines in production and rig counts  it sets up a pretty bullish case for natural gas  The natural gas drilling rig count just reached a new 14 year low  If another cold blast hits this year and production continues to decline  we could see easily another  1 2 Mcf increase in price for gas  TER  Can a dry gas well justify the exploration and production  E P  cost or does it have to have liquids  AL  The vast majority of dry gas plays are not economic in this price environment  Operators have largely already switched their drilling plans in favor of oil and liquids rich targets  Even if gas prices increase another  1 Mcf or even  2 Mcf  I don t know if it s enough to swing the pendulum back toward natural gas drilling  The economics of the liquids plays  especially the oil prone plays  are just much better  Producers are also pushing for the exportation of liquid natural gas outside of the U S   which I think will happen in the next few years  That will create a new market for the gas and new demand for it  while reducing the supply here and increasing the price  I m definitely bullish on gas over the long term  but in the short term we could still have some bumps  The energy equivalent price for natural gas right now is approximately  25 per barrel   25 bbl  compared to crude oil  and that disparity just won t last over the long term  TER  What are the prospects for natural gas as a transportation fuel  AL  The future is big  It s being used now for dump trucks and city transportation  There s a push toward utilizing natural gas for long haul trucking fleets  but I m disappointed that more hasn t been done to realize the potential for consumer auto fuel  It would save consumers a lot of money and  create a lot of jobs and provide a big boost for the economy  It would also reduce our dependence on foreign oil while creating a positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions  people s health and the environment  It s one case where I think the government could actually help get the ball rolling  with a tax incentive or some sort of stimulus  I m really surprised that this hasn t gained more traction  TER  Your three pronged investment strategy focuses on management  assets and catalysts for growth  Which companies excel in all three of these areas  AL  Apache Corp   APA NYSE   ConocoPhillips  COP NYSE   EnerJex Resources Inc   ENRJ OTCBB   GreenHunter Energy Inc   GRH NYSE MKT  and Sonde Resources Corp   SOQ NYSE  all offer a compelling value proposition at the current prices and are catalyst rich  TER  How has Sonde s offshore Tunisia oil development performed  AL  Its exploration program has been very successful  The company has established a huge oil and gas reserve base  and there is a strong market for the gas in that area as well  The gas there is nearly as valuable as the oil  On top of what it has already discovered  there is tremendous potential to discover new reserves  The exploration prospects that remain on Sonde s acreage block have a much more favorable risk reward profile compared to most international offshore prospects  Sonde has established a large reserve base that can be economically developed on a standalone basis  and it is being developed now  TER  Have the revolutions in Tunisia and Libya affected that project at all  AL  Yes  and I d say more so Tunisia  where there has recently been a shakeup in the government  Sonde recently secured an attractive farm out arrangement for its North African assets  The arrangement is a good deal for the company  and it s also a great deal for the government because the proposed partner is large and can bring great resources to the project  The partner is Viking Energy North Africa  Ltd   a private company backed by the Thome Group  based out of Singapore  That group is one of the largest shipping companies in the world  and it also manufactures the offshore production facilities for developments like Sonde s  Under the agreement that Sonde struck  all of the development costs associated with its established reserves  known as the Zarat discovery  will be carried by Viking  and Sonde will retain a 33  carried interest  On top of that  Sonde will essentially be carried for three exploration wells  which have the potential to multiply the resources that have already been discovered there  This deal was struck at the end of 2012  and it was expected to be completed around the end of Q1 13  but it appears that Sonde has not been able to get the Tunisian government to sign off on the transaction  That is really puzzling to me given the merits of the deal  but I assume that the recent government shakeup in Tunisia has delayed the process  It s really a win win for both the company and Tunisia  and making it successful will also help Tunisia attract additional foreign investment as opposed to discouraging it if the deal is rejected  If the transaction doesn t get approved for some reason  then I expect that Sonde will simply finance the development through a different type of deal structure  which should provide it with the same economic benefit  TER  How does the farm out benefit Sonde  AL  It gives it exposure to a very large amount of cash flow  which is slated to begin in 2015 at virtually no cost to Sonde  In fact  Sonde should easily generate more cash from this project in its first year of production than its entire enterprise value right now  Its partner will contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the project and bring it online  and Sonde will reap 33  of the benefits at virtually no further cost  Each of the exploration wells that it will be carried on is estimated to cost approximately  25 million   25M   So it has substantial benefits  especially for a company the size of Sonde  TER  Sonde s Western Canadian Strategic Alternatives Process is preventing the company from committing to a capital program in 2013  according to its recent annual report  How will that affect its ability to grow shareholder value this year  AL  Sonde is a very small company that s extremely asset rich  and I think it is flying totally under the radar of investors  Right now  the company is trying to close the Tunisia deal and figure out where and how to allocate capital and whether it should sell assets  The stock is absurdly cheap regardless of how these processes play out  and I think the company could fetch a multiple of its current price if it wanted to sell  Outside the North African assets  the company has the potential to unlock a substantial amount of value this year via a number of different catalysts  including from its Western Canada asset portfolio  The company has hired FirstEnergy Capital out of Calgary  which is a premier investment bank  to run a strategic review process for its Western Canada assets  Basically  the company put all of its assets into a data room  and numerous companies are getting an opportunity review and bid on the properties  That includes approximately 100 thousand  100K  acres in the Duvernay play and 50K acres in the Montney play  both of which are red hot right now  This acreage can fetch up to  10K acre or more if it is successfully proven up  There is a lot of activity in the area  and a lot of acreage has been proven up in areas surrounding Sonde s position  In addition  Sonde owns 100K acres in two other emerging oil resource plays  The company also produces more than 2 thousand barrels oil equivalent per day  2 Mboe d  from more conventional properties  Sonde currently has a market capitalization of only  70M  In addition to its producing assets  Sonde has nearly  20M of net cash on its balance sheet  plus all of the undeveloped assets that I mentioned  both the resource play assets and the North African assets  The stock is around  1 15 share right now  I think the shares can fetch  5 once the company figures out its path in Tunisia and completes its strategic review process in Canada  If just a portion of the Western Canada resource play acreage turns out to be productive  we could see a ten bagger in this stock  I believe a lot of this will play out over the next 12 months  As Warren Buffet says   Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy   I think it s time to be greedy with Sonde  TER  EnerJex s price recently jumped from around  0 50 to the  0 65 neighborhood after declining for the last year  It s now at  0 57  Is that a portent  AL  I will say first that I am a director of EnerJex  so I am biased  I was involved in the transformation of the company at the end of 2010  At that time  EnerJex completed a comprehensive transaction that included multiple acquisitions and a significant infusion of equity capital  The board is very focused on per share value creation  The stock was over  1 share a couple of years ago  so it really hasn t made up much ground  but the company s performance has been outstanding  It has rapidly increased production  cash flow and proven reserves  I believe there has been a lot of selling pressure over the past two years from vintage shareholders  The supply of shares appears to be starting to dry up  so the supply and demand dynamic is changing  EnerJex is attractive because it has a large inventory of shallow conventional oil drilling opportunities  Unconventional shale plays are desirable due to their repeatability  and EnerJex has a lot of repeatability in its Eastern Kansas asset base  which is rare  Most conventional plays have been largely tapped out or are on their third legs  so this is unique  I also think the economics associated with EnerJex s drilling portfolio are better than most  if not all  of the big shale plays  The company has a market capitalization of only  45M  It has approximately  10M of very low interest rate debt and yet it has nearly 3 million barrels  3 MMbbl  of proved oil reserves and a large undeveloped asset base  In addition  the company has nearly  10M of additional liquidity through its senior credit facility  which bears interest at 3 75  per annum  The company just reported that it has identified 400 drilling opportunities in one of its oil plays  Those opportunities are not factored into its current reserve report  It expects to earn into 1K additional acres in its Mississippian play next month  which will provide a significant amount of additional reserve exposure  EnerJex actually repurchased 2M shares of its common stock at the end of 2012  It s very rare for a microcap E P company to repurchase such a significant amount of stock  It speaks volumes about the board s conviction for the equity and also its confidence in management s ability to execute the business plan  The company s CEO  Robert Watson Jr   works as hard as anybody I know  His father runs Abraxas Petroleum Corp   AXAS NASDAQ   which is also a publicly traded oil and gas company  Robert has gained a lot of experience being a third generation oilman  He also has a significant amount of private equity experience and knows how to build a company  He personally owns a large stake in EnerJex and is determined to be successful  TER  GreenHunter started in 2005 as a renewable energy company  In 2009  it changed its business strategy to focus on water resource management related to the oil and gas industry  and its stock plummeted  How have investors responded to that  AL  I don t think the stock went down as a result of the change in its business plan  I think it was a number of other factors that were all occurring around the same time  including a major hurricane that wiped out its largest asset  It was a difficult time a few years ago for the market in general  and especially for small companies focused on renewable energy  The company went through a tough period and had to reinvent itself  but the new business plan is fantastic  Investors have definitely started to respond favorably  The stock climbed from  0 85 per share in 2012 to nearly  3 50 at one point  The shares have fallen back since that time to about  1 50 where they appear to have stabilized  TER  That  3 50 was a momentary peak  It lingered at levels lower than that  but it is back down now  Water resource management for the oil and gas industry is an utterly different business from renewable energy development  Is the management equally knowledgeable about both missions  AL  The company has completely shifted its focus away from renewable energy  It s only focused on the water resource management business right now  Most companies that were in GreenHunter s position a few years ago have gone out of business  The fact that GreenHunter has stayed alive and is actually flourishing now is a testament to management s experience and tenacity  Management is much more experienced in the water resource management business due to its deep experience and relationships in the oil and gas industry  TER  Has the asset base been converted to serve the new strategy  AL  Absolutely  The company has been innovative in the products that it s brought to market  and it s been on the forefront in the very early stages of this emerging industry  It s growing rapidly as a result  The company recently reported a 1 400  increase in revenue for 2012  It also reported adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  of more than  5M for the year  The company is now positioned in a number of the big shale plays or resource plays in the U S   including the Eagle Ford shale  the Mississippian Lime  the Marcellus shale  the Utica shale and the Bakken shale  The company is only scratching the surface  but it has established early positions in these major plays that it should really be able to leverage over time  GreenHunter provides soup to nuts water management services for the oil and gas industry related to drilling  completing and producing hydrocarbons from the shale plays  These plays are developed through horizontal drilling  and they re completed utilizing fracture stimulation technology  which requires a tremendous amount of water through the whole cycle of drilling  completing and producing  including disposal  The industry is still in its infancy  and the growth opportunities are staggering when you consider the size and scope of these shale plays in the U S  and how much water is involved in that process  Based on management s track record  Gary Evans  in particular  I expect the company to build and sell  I think this will be a takeout at some point in the future  and I do think there s quite a bit of runway before the company sells out  GreenHunter has been able to access a lot of capital and favorable terms through the issuance of perpetual preferred stock  which is yielding over 13  now  and this security is listed on a major exchange  GreenHunter is forecasting revenue growth of more than 100  in 2013  I think as it continues to grow  it will get on a lot more radar screens than it is on now and have a lot more exposure to institutional investors that are looking for these types of growth opportunities  TER  Apache and ConocoPhillips are two others you mentioned  They re in a different league entirely from these three  What are your thoughts that you wanted to share on them  AL  We look at the whole spectrum of E P companies  from microcap to super major  These are two stocks that really stand out to me as being attractive investment opportunities  Conoco recently spun off all of its midstream and downstream businesses  so it s no longer an integrated company  It s now the largest independent oil and gas company in the country  The spinoff has proven to be successful for shareholders  and I think it may be the start of a trend for the bigger players  Conoco is attractive because it is very cheap and it has an outstanding undeveloped asset base  It trades at about 4 5 times EBITDA and  12 bbl of proved reserves  It has an incredible land position  in the middle of the sweet spots in a number of the big resource plays like the Eagle Ford  the Bakken and the Duvernay up in Canada  It has a tremendous amount of drilling to do in those plays  which should have very strong economic returns  The stock yields 4 5   which is very attractive in this low interest rate environment  Apache is probably even cheaper than Conoco  It also has a very strong margin of safety as a result of the valuation  The stock is near a five year low despite continued growth and also despite an asset portfolio that would be very attractive to a larger player  Apache is a big company  It has a  30 billion   30B  market capitalization  but it s trading at only 3 5 times EBITDA and around  15 bbl proved reserves  It could definitely attract a suitor  Conoco could as well  even though Conoco is a much bigger company than Apache  with a market cap north of  70B  These companies both have big acreage positions in big plays that would be really attractive to a larger company  especially at their current valuations  They could be accretive for larger companies and offer a lot of drilling opportunities  Apache is the number one driller in the Permian basin  where it has a huge footprint  TER  Is consolidation coming to the gas industry  AL  For gas in particular  there have been a lot of willing buyers  who are contrarian and want to buy at the low  but I don t think there have been as many sellers as people expected because the sellers are also expecting gas prices to increase  I do think  though  in this business  in general  you either buy or get bought eventually  So the industry will always be prone to consolidation  Right now is a particularly interesting time because of the low interest rate and the emergence of new domestic resource plays  A lot of these plays are evolving and some smaller companies have gotten into these plays and built acreage positions  One in particular  Osage Exploration and Development Inc   OEDV OTCBB   has developed a significant position right in a very attractive area of the Mississippian Lime play  This is an area that is dominated by much larger companies that are flush with cash  Companies like Osage that are small and have really attractive acreage positions in plays that are being dominated by the big boys are logical takeout candidates at some point  That will continue to be a trend in the future as smaller companies acquire acreage in the emerging resource plays  TER  I appreciate your time today   is the chief investment officer of West Coast Asset Management  Inc   a founder and principal of

192058,413574,APA,Don t Frack Me Up,opinion,To many walking the planet  fracking has a seriously bad reputation  Thanks to hyperbole and misinformation  fracking opponents have convinced a lot of people that the operators who drill and then hydraulically fracture underground rock layers thumb their noses at and even hate the environment Anti fracking claims may be twists on reality   for example  that a legislative loophole makes fracking exempt from the America s Safe Drinking Water Act  when really this federal legislation never regulated fracking because it is a state concern  Then there s the completely absurd  such as the idea that frac operators are allowed to and regularly do inject frac fluids directly into underground water supplies We decided to set the record straight by using facts  not playing on emotion like many of the frac tivists do  It s important because unconventional oil and gas constitute an increasingly pivotal part of the world s energy scene  In the United States  where shale gas abounds but imported energy rules the day  this is especially true America s shale deposits hold a heck of a lot of gas  According to the United States Geological Survey  the Marcellus Shale alone is home to 84 trillion cubic feet  TCF  of technically recoverable natural gas  Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas contained in all of America s shale basins range as high as 3 000 TCF To access this gas  fluids made of water  sand  and chemicals to increase lubrication  inhibit corrosion of equipment  and possessing other qualities are pumped into the shale formation  When the pressure from the fluids exceeds the strength of the rocks  the rock fractures  and in a demonstration of might by the mighty small  the granules of sand prop the fractures open  Once the fracturing is completed  the internal pressure from the formation pushes the injected fluids to the surface again Frac wells are only open to the surrounding rock at the depth of the target formation  Starting at 250 feet  76 meters  or thereabouts above the producing interval   it varies a bit from state to state   the production casing must be cemented  This graphic  borrowed from the Texas Oil and Gas Association  shows what the procedure entails Casings are the liners that isolate the inside of the well from the surrounding rock  and from anyCasings are the liners that isolate the inside of the well from the surrounding rock  and from any water that might be contained in that rock  The surface casing is the first line of defense  while the production casing provides a second layer of protection for the groundwater Casings do require proper cementation to be effective  the cement seals the annular spaces between successive casing layers to provide a barrier to vertical and horizontal fluid movement  A poor cementation job was a significant factor in the Deepwater Horizon well blowout  and that transpired because deepwater regulations were insufficient  On land  however  cementation is highly regulated  and inspections of wells in progress  announced and unannounced  are common Unlike deepwater drilling  fracking is not new  Nor is fracking specific to natural gas or to the United States  Drillers frac many thousands of oil and gas wells around the world every year  In America  oil and gas producers have been using hydraulic fracturing since at least the 1940s to enhance recoveries from older oil wells and to access the oil in tight reservoirs  such as the Bakken Then there s shale gas  a domestic source of energy for North America that s much more reliable and secure than the millions of barrels of oil that come from places like Nigeria  Venezuela  Iraq  Angola  and Algeria every day  And as we ve said  accessing that gas using hydraulic fracturing is much less dangerous and damaging than many people think Gasland   More Drama Than DocumentaryFrac bashing really took off last year  with the debut of the film Gasland  After receiving a letter offering his family US 100 000 for the right to drill frac wells on their land  a documentary film maker by the name of Josh Fox decided to investigate  Gasland is the product of that investigation  which took Fox to Pennsylvania  New York  Ohio  and West Virginia to interview other people living atop the newly discovered Marcellus Shale  Fox also visits Colorado  Wyoming  Utah  and Texas to talk to those who have been living alongside natural gas drilling for the last decade The resulting film is well crafted  dramatic  and emotional  However  documentaries are also supposed to convey context and a fair representation of the facts  That s where Fox failed Let s be clear  fracking is not without drawbacks  and more on that in a moment   What drives us Casey  Focused on Facts  Research types crazy is messing with the data  Some examples Industry EffortsAs we alluded to earlier  fracking does has its drawbacks  two of which stand out in particular  The first is that hydraulic fracturing uses a fair chunk of water   an average multi stage frac requires a total 5 million gallons of water  To put that number in context  electric generation uses nearly 150 million gallons per day in the Susquehanna River Basin of Pennsylvania Nonetheless  industry engineers are working hard to reduce water usage  After all  they know as well as anyone else what their livelihood depends on The most important shift here has been toward recycling frac fluids  In Pennsylvania  the fracking industry now reuses more than 60  of its water  for example  In addition  companies are exploring other  more creative water reduction strategies  In British Columbia  energy giant EnCana Corp  T ECA  and its partner Apache Corp  NYSE APA  spent nine months and C 10 million finding a deep  sour water aquifer and then figuring out how to make the super salty  hydrogen sulfide laced water usable for fracking  This novel technique could significantly reduce the need for fracking operations to use freshwater supplies The second drawback is that the fluids that flow back to the surface after a fracturing are often stored in containment units that have been known to leak As we pointed out  pits  lined or not  are being phased out in many jurisdictions  precisely because it s truly difficult to tell whether a pit dug into the earth is leaking  This is where companies like  Poseidon Concepts  T PSN  come in  Instead of lined pits and even the dozens of steel tanks that are the not so ideal alternative  PSN offers above ground lined frames that are inexpensive and much more environmentally sound Another way to ease the problem of frac fluids spills or leaks is to make frac fluids so benign that we could literally drink them  It sounds pie in the sky  but the world s second largest oilfield services company is working hard on the idea  In fact  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  has created a frac fluid called CleanStim  made from materials sourced from the food industry  A Halliburton executive showed the stuff at a recent conference   and then tossed it down his gullet Where there s a need  an innovator will rise to the challenge  and there are plenty of innovators in the world of oil and gas Fracking Earthquakes  Hazard or  Preventative A few weeks ago privately held Cuadrilla Resources  the first company to successfully frac natural gas shales in Europe and a Casey Energy team recommendation back in early 2008  announced that its fracking operations caused two small earthquakes in northwest England last April and May  After the earthquakes  Cuadrilla voluntarily suspended its fracking operations in the area while an independent group investigated the events The earthquakes measured 2 3 and 1 5 on the Richter scale  Seismic events  to be sure  but so gentle they were barely felt  Indeed  the independent report found that Cuadrilla s work had caused the tremors  but the earth moved so little that they posed no threat to anyone or anything And what others may consider concern  we consider potential  As two plates of Earth s crust naturally shift along their fault line  they can sometimes get hung up on rocky  hooks  called asperities  As the plates keep trying to move  stress builds and builds  The huge earthquakes we all fear occur when the stored energy has built enough to break through the asperity  the gradual slide becomes a destructive jerk Small tremors  on the other hand  reduce the pressure one bit at a time  Whenever there is a major earthquake or a discussion of when California or Vancouver or Japan will get hit with the next Big One  someone often laments   If only we had a way to release the pressure beforehand  What if hydraulic fracturing could relieve the stress on the faults in earthquake prone areas  Clearly the notion needs a battery of modeling and tests before it s anything but a concept  but on a basic level the idea makes sense  Perhaps by releasing the accumulated stress at depth slowly with small tremors  we could mitigate the Big One enough that it might not be so big after all If nothing else  the concept is a reminder not to fear serendipity  Finding something you didn t expect when attempting something else is how the scientific world achieved many of its major breakthroughs A Resource We Can t IgnoreThe ability to produce clean burning natural gas from the 48 shale basins in 32 countries around the world could transform the global energy economy and increase energy security  starting in the United States Hydraulic fracturing has become a scapegoat  targeted by environmentalists as another attempt by the oil and gas industry to lock America into fossil fuel dependence  The thing is  America is already addicted to fossil fuels  Until that changes  even environmentalists will need to heat their homes  charge their cell phones  and purchase products made at gas powered factories We of the Casey Research energy team are always looking for alternative energy ideas that stand the test of economics  but to date only geothermal and run of river power have come close  In the case of geothermal power  the industry has gotten ahead of itself and for now  at least  has failed to come through on its promises  As for run of river  the projects often work  but they provide only a drop into the big bucket of power needs  and each project requires major negotiations from landowners afflicted with NIMBY   not in my back yard   syndrome So next time someone says that America should put an end to fracking  ask them how they plan to ensure America s energy security over the next 30 to 50 years  If the answer involves alternative or renewable energies  ask for some hard facts and numbers to support it  Like it or not  none of our alternative energies are as yet even close to stepping up as a major energy pillar for America Natural gas is ready to step up  It s not a perfect solution   it s much better at providing peak demand than baseload power  still takes energy to produce  and still produces greenhouse gases   but it s an important part of the solution for now  Not only does America have the reserves  the fracturing process that can unlock them has been demonstrated as safe   and equally important  not demonstrated as not safe  And the industry that uses it seeks and incorporates improvements along the way  Just the facts  ma am ,2012-01-20,Jim Quinn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/don’t-frack-me-up-111710,111710

ago I invested in an electric car battery company  Ener1  and thankfully got out of it after breaking even  On Thursday  the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  Ener1 was another beneficiary of the Obama administration  with the Energy Department awarding it  118 million in stimulus funds  Just one year ago  Vice President Biden visited the company s new battery plant in Indiana  So add this one to the Solyndra   535 million  narrative  Yes  some companies fail  or as President Obama said in his State of the Union address   Some technologies don t pan out But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy  House Energy and Commerce subcommittee Chairman Cliff Stearns  R Fla   countered  Sadly  the Department of Energy s jobs record seems to grow worse by the day and it is American taxpayers who are paying the price  The administration forecast that Ener1 would have a workforce of 1 400 by 2013  It recently had 350 As alluded to above  shares in Apple soared 6   as the

68  of likely voters in the state support Governor Jerry Brown s plan for higher taxes on individuals earning  250 000 and couples making  500 000  Support for increasing sales taxes is about the

Stanley Chairman and CEO James Gorman addressed the compensation issue in an interview with Bloomberg television  Those who don t grasp the reasoning behind the average cut in pay of 20  to 30  for investment bankers and traders need to adjust their attitude  You re na ve  read the newspaper  No  1   said Gorman   No  2  if you put your compensation in a one year context to define your overall level of happiness  you have a problem which is much bigger than the job  And No  3  if you re really unhappy  just leave  I mean  life s too short  Gee  I kind of like Mr  Gorman after reading this  I d just add a fourth point  You are all still grossly overpaid   Gorman s own pay was cut 25   Citigroup also cut 2011 bonuses in its investment banking division by about 30   Bloomberg reports some businesses had them reduced by as much as 70  I missed this last week  Goldman Sachs cut its charitable contributions to its donor advised fund by more than 3 4s to  78 million after a steep drop in

reins at BlackBerry maker Research in Motion  replacing the former co chief executives  Tweedledee and Tweedledum  What upset the market was that Heins  formerly co chief operating officer of RIM  said he would consult with his predecessors and that the existing strategy was sound Wall Street Journal  Last week  the ratio of the price of oil to that of natural gas broke through 40 times for the first time ever  To put that in context  in pure energy equivalency terms  oil should cost somewhere between six and 10 times the price of gas  Right now  Americans are paying an extraordinary premium for the convenience of liquid fuels over natural gas  The infrastructure challenge  however  will prevent the nation from benefiting en masse for years to come but the right steps are finally being taken  even as nat gas producers deal with the poor economics that low prices bring  The second largest producer  Chesapeake Energy  announced it would slash gas drilling by nearly half  Nat gas prices jumped 8  on the news  even more for the week Meanwhile  Apache Corp  acquired Cordillera Energy Partners III for  2 85 billion in a deal that gives Apache 254 000 acres of rich oil and natural

Harper to stick it to the Obama White House and build a pipeline to Canada s west coast instead for the purpose of shipping oil to China  I should have added last week that this potentiality faces all kinds of problems of its own  including protests from Indian tribes whose lands the pipeline would cross  though British Columbians back the idea  48  to 32  I loved how the president during the State of the Union  took credit for the shale gas revolution he had nothing to do with   as the Journal put it And you had Obama s line   No bailout  no handouts and no cop outs  just minutes after hailing
