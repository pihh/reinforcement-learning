2391,223906,CTWS,Trade Fears  Weak Retail Sales Gloom Investors  ,opinion," Don t be into trends  Don t make fashion own you  but you decide what you are  what you want to express by the way you dress and the way you live     Gianni Versace

It goes without saying that each individual is unique and has their own way of approaching the world  Many people express their individuality through their appearance  Who has not seen the multi colored mohawk adorning a young person and wondered what statement they are making  Clothing can also be used to use as a way to set oneself apart  The fashion industry appeals to many young people with the glamour of being on the catwalk  in movies  on magazine covers  or in television  Consider how many people watch the Victoria Secret yearly special  and it is all because of the clothing  right  Well  forget that last observation  Anyway  in the fashion world  different trends come and go  whether it is denim  plaid  solids  or stripes  and trying to anticipate what might appeal to the public is easier said than done  It is why top notch designers like Tom Ford  Coco Chanel  Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   and a few others are thought of so highly as it is a difficult chore  Those who are able to do so  or even repeat the feat  become legends  How does this apply to investing  you might ask 
Well  it is similar in that many in the investment community are trying to anticipate what style might be more acceptable in the current economic climate  There are two basic approaches  growth and value  In the last ten years or so  growth has been the superior performer by far for any number of reasons  one pertaining to the  new normal  environment of zero to minimal economic growth  With inflation and interest rates heading higher  many think value will perform much better  at the very least because it has so badly lagged and reversion to the mean would dictate it is now the more appropriate strategy  There are other tactics as well  including but not limited to deep value  merger arbitrage  or balance sheet arbitrage  My own take is you need to use a wide variety of strategies within your portfolio and individual selections probably should have some aspect of one or all of these possibilities  You don t want to use just one as if it fails  you have a portfolio which will not perform  For example  if you focused on merger arbitrage  this week would have been difficult because the Trump Administration told Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  to forget about trying to buy Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   AT T Inc  NYSE T  also has a problem with a similar situation in it s pursuit of Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX   I think you want small cap  big cap  medium cap  value  growth  mergers  takeovers  spin offs  currency plays  even options and in a wide variety of sectors  The same way that Versace approached fashion  where you select the approach that fits your life  is my thinking with respect to investing  I certainly am no Versace  but I liked his style  and more importantly  his unique approach 
Regarding the general market this week  the continuing turnover in the Trump administration with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  a weak February retail sales number  along with the denial of the Broadcom purchase of Qualcomm  all unsettled the market a bit  On the earnings front  Signet Jewelers Ltd  NYSE SIG  beat but revealed a three year restructuring plan  taking the stock to fresh lows  It might be appealing to Mr  Buffett as in combination with Borsheim s and other jewelers  there is a ton of possibility there  The price probably would be appealing to Warren as well  Williams Sonoma Inc  NYSE WSM  and Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   both considered high end names  different sectors  got different receptions with their reports as Tiffany s was dull while cookware was strong  Ulta Beauty Inc  NASDAQ ULTA  the giant retail salon  disappointed but investors ignored the results as the stock rebounded strongly  In the technology area  Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE  impressed yet again with excellent subscription numbers  The water world saw a big merger with Connecticut Water Service Inc  NASDAQ CTWS  merging with SJW Group  Here in Las Vegas  Golden Entertainment Inc  NASDAQ GDEN  reported and announced they will put a bunch of money into the Stratosphere  which is similar to what Red Rock Resorts Inc  NASDAQ RRR  is doing with the Palms and Palace Station properties  Like fashion  resorts must look the part to attract customers 
Finally  I thought I would mention that Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was charged with fraud by the SEC and settled for 500 thousand dollars  Along with the CFO  she was accused of projecting revenues of 100 million when in fact they only totaled 100 thousand  On her star studded board of directors is one James Mattis  the mad doggy  you know  the current Secretary of Defense  It seems Theranos was being touted as a way to reduce testing costs in the military as well as on the retail side  Regardless  at one time Theranos was very much the flavor of the month in the health care world  It is another example of why one should be very careful with the hottest trend be it Theranos  health care   denim  fashion   or bitcoin  investing   Thank you for reading the blog this week  and if you have any questions about investing  please email me at information y hc com

2403,223918,CTWS,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  NextEra  Duke Energy   Black Hills And Connecticut Water,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 10  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Utilities  including NextEra Energy Inc    NYSE NEE    Duke Energy Corp    NYSE DUK    Black Hills Corporation   NYSE BKH   and Connecticut Water Service Inc    NASDAQ CTWS   Industry  Utilities  Part 3Link   Though utility companies are among the safest investment bets  they have their share of weaknesses  Regulatory burdens  weather variation and increased debt loads are major concerns  While the Trump administration is expected to lower the industry s regulatory burden  an even bigger issue is the interest rate backdrop Let s look into the factors which might deter investors from investing in the utility space Debt Levels   Rising RatesUtilities are capital intensive and need to have a continuous inflow of funds to maintain organic growth and infrastructure upgrade projects  This is essential for maintaining an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities like electricity  fresh water and gas Utilities generate funds from operations which are to some extent used to meet their capital requirements  But these funds are mostly used for dividend payouts  They take recourse to external sources of financing to meet their capital requirements We believe that a rising interest rate environment could add to the woes of utility operators  as it will increase cost of capital  restraining their ability to pay consistent dividends  We suggest that investors take note of outstanding debts and current ratio  both of which indicate the company s ability to meet its debt obligations Weather a Headwind Weather plays a vital role in driving demand for utility services  A normal winter and summer season assure higher demand for utility services  However  a milder winter and a cooler summer results in lower demand for utility services The credit rating firm  Moody s has estimated that hurricanes Harvey and Irma will lead to around  150  200 billion loss in the United States and additional  20  30 billion economic expenses owing to disruption of services NextEra Energy Inc   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  and Duke Energy Corp  have made substantial investments in Florida in the last few years to strengthen their power delivery systems  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here However  the hurricanes caused damages to the solar panels installed in the state  Repairing and restoration of the solar panels will result in additional expenditures for the companies that already have made substantial investment in solar power generation Competition with BondsThese reliable dividend payers are in competition with bonds as an investment option  The ongoing increase in interest rates will definitely make bonds with its yields another attractive investment option for risk averse investors  driving them away from the utility space The Fed raised interest rates in four of the last five quarters  December 2016  March 2017  June 2017 and December 2017   which is a drag for rate sensitive sectors like Utilities  Making things worse  the Fed might hike interest rates thrice in 2018  if economic conditions remain conducive The increasing interest rates will raise the cost of capital for the utilities and might adversely impact its ability to carry on with dividend payment and share buybacks  making the high interest bearing bonds a more alluring option for investors Safe But Limited Growth PotentialInvestment in these highly regulated defensive utilities is considered safe  Even though utilities pay regular dividends and go for buybacks  the scope of capital appreciation is quite

2470,223985,CTWS,5 Defensive Stocks That Are Surviving Brexit Turmoil ,opinion,The bloodbath in U S  stocks continued into Monday with the markets off more than 1 5   extending Friday s post Brexit sell off  This was because investors were concerned about the economic and political consequences of U K  s vote to leave the European Union The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1 5  on Monday to close at its lowest level since Mar 10  Over the last the two sessions  the index has shed 871 points  Meanwhile  the S P 500 dropped 1 8  and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2 4  in yesterday s session With billions of dollars already being wiped off  what should investors do  One proven way to counter the volatility is to opt for defensive funds and stocks  These are generally immune to recession  economic slowdown or market volatility by virtue of the nature of their businesses  Defensive plays include utilities  medical companies  consumer staples and tobacco stocks   basically companies providing products and services that consumers cannot do without irrespective of market downturns or a wayward referendum across the Atlantic And investors have taken recourse to just that  Utilities and telecom were the only two to advance post Brexit among all S P 500 sectors  Utility companies like American Electric Power Co   Inc    NYSE AEP   and American Water Works Company  Inc    NYSE AWK   as well as the U S  based retailer Dollar General Corp    NYSE DG   rose in the last two sessions Again  a few higher yield dividend plays in the specialty real estate investment trust  REIT  segment are rising as well  Notably  these stocks mostly have an exclusive U S  exposure and the belief that rates will stay lower for longer is helping their case  Then again  gold miners and pharmaceuticals rose on both Friday and Monday as many investors turned to safe haven assets Our ChoicesAs the markets are expected to remain volatile for some time  it is vital to build your portfolio with prudence  This is why it would be better to pick safer bets at this point  In such a situation  picking stocks that are mostly domestic oriented  preferably with a low beta  would be a good option  Our picks

2476,223991,CTWS,Small Cap Utility Stocks  No Flash  All Cash,opinion,"In recent weeks  we ve talked about   cancer cures   and   among other dazzling subject matter focused on innovation and  exponential technologies  
Today we re going to take it a little  old school   We re going to focus on small cap stocks that help provide protection for your wealth over the long term  generate consistent income  and are desired by some of the best investors the world has ever known 
I m talking about essential services   electric  gas and water utilities   that form the bailiwick for that traditional group of safety conscious  risk averse investors   widows and orphans  
In a world where artificially low interest rates continue to punish savers and retirees  yields of 2 5   3   and higher offered by utilities are pretty compelling 
Consider  Nearly 500 million people are living in countries with negative interest rates  In the United States  we re coping with 0 05  rates on traditional savings accounts  1 05  on  high yield savings  rates  and 1 55  yields on U S  10 year notes 
That s to say nothing of the dividend growth that will carry share prices even higher going forward 
And there s a long term consolidation trend  particularly in the power space  which should continue to juice valuations 
These are attractive assets for sophisticated global investors seeking steady returns from critical businesses with staying power 
Spain s Iberdrola  MC IBE  used its USA unit to acquire diversified utility UIL Holdings Corp  in December 2015 for approximately  3 billion  Iberdrola paid a 25  premium for UIL s consistent  reliable revenue and earnings  as well as to provide a hedge against unpredictable energy policies and sluggish economic growth in Spain 
In April 2016  Cleco Corp  was acquired by a consortium of investors led by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets  MIRA  and British Columbia Investment Management Corp   bcIMC  for approximately  4 7 billion  The MIRA bcIMC group paid a 15  premium for Cleco  which the consortium described as a  well run utility  and  an attractive infrastructure business operating in a stable  regulated environment  
Those themes have defined large scale electric utility acquisitions since 1999  when Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa  announced the acquisition of Iowa based utility MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co  for  2 billion and  7 billion in assumed debt 
Warren Buffett explained the move this way 

 We buy good companies with outstanding management and good growth potential at a fair price  and we re willing to wait longer than some investors for that potential to be realized  

Berkshire and Buffett have used MidAmerican Energy as a vehicle for additional utility expansion  including a  5 1 billion deal to buy PacifiCorp from Scottish Power in mid 2005  a  5 6 billion deal for NV Energy Inc  in 2013  and a  2 9 billion deal for Alberta  Canada  transmission grid operator AltaLink 
As Buffett said at the time of the announcement of the PacifiCorp acquisition  energy will be  an important industry 10  20  50 years from now  and Berkshire Hathaway hopes to expand its investments  in the sector 
 We will look at energy assets around the world   he said   The energy field is one that I basically like  It s not a business you can dream about  however  It s a capital intensive business that provides decent returns  It s stable and it s predictable  
The key concern right now when it comes to essential service stocks   including electric  gas  and water utilities   is  fair price  
Yield hungry investors  starved amid this era of  ZIRP    NIRP   and other forms of extraordinary monetary policy the world over  have chased utilities  share prices ever higher in search of  stable and predictable  income 
But let s remember that famed  value investor  Buffett agreed to pay a 28 6  premium to MidAmerican s share price on October 22  1999  the last trading day before the deal s announcement  And he paid a 23  premium for NV Energy in 2013 
More recent mergers in the utility sector  including WEC Energy Group Inc  s 2015 acquisition of Integrys Energy Group Inc   have come at more modest valuations 
WEC paid a 17  premium for Integrys  while this year  Great Plains Energy Inc  agreed to pay 13  above Westar Energy Inc  s May 30 closing price in a deal announced May 31 
WEC was once rumored to be a target of Buffett s MidAmerican Energy  valued for its strong management  regulated and diversified operations  consistent and reliable revenue and earnings growth  and the solid health of its local economic base 
So which among the group of small cap power utilities fit those criteria 
IDACORP Inc  NYSE IDA   The holding company for electric utility Idaho Power  derives more than 90  its revenue from regulated activities  Earnings have improved year to year from 2008 2015 consecutively  Its service territory is enjoying solid economic growth  too  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Idaho has been the No  1 state for job growth since March 2015  The regulatory environment is also favorable  And management continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet  All of which will support continuing customer and revenue growth as well as solid annual dividend growth  Idacorp s share price has surged 23  over the last year  and the stock is trading at nearly 21 times trailing 12 months earnings  The dividend yield is still relatively attractive at 2 6   and in the current low rate environment multiple  there s additional multiple expansion ahead based on the company s strong fundamentals 
Avista Corporation  NYSE AVA   The company serves electric and natural gas customers in eastern Washington  northern Idaho  parts of Oregon  and Alaska  Its revenue is 96  regulated  It also enjoys solid underlying economic fundamentals in its service territory  Like Idacorp  yield chasers have bid up Avista s share price  but it s poised for growth in customer base  revenue  earnings  and dividends  Avista yields 3 3  at current levels 
Portland General Electric  NYSE GE  Company  NYSE POR  benefits from the same positive economic trends buoying Idacorp and Avista in the Pacific Northwest  All of its revenue is generated from regulated activity  After a 6 7  dividend increase announced along with first quarter 2016 results  Portland General yields 3  
The consolidation game for U S  water utilities differs quite a bit from that in the power sector 
Most of the water systems in the United States don t have the resources to meet safe drinking water standards  particularly with pollutants intensifying from every direction 
Rising pressure to upgrade infrastructure also argues for greater scale and the increased access to capital it brings 
Most of the sector s takeover action will continue to be in the 85  of U S  water systems owned by companies with fewer than 3 300 customers 
That augurs well for continued growth by acquisition among heavyweights such as American Water Works  NYSE AWK  and Aqua America Inc  NYSE WTR  
But smaller operators such as Connecticut Water Service Inc  NASDAQ CTWS   which yields 2 3   and The York Water Company  NASDAQ YORW   which yields 2 1   will also be able to grow customer bases via tuck in acquisitions of smaller  neighboring systems 
Regulated operations support more than 90  of Connecticut Water s revenue and 100  of York Water s 
York Water  which serves a small  concentrated territory in south central Pennsylvania  is the one investor owned water utility that could generate a bid from a larger peer 
With the Federal Reserve continuing to hem and haw over its next rate hike  stocks that generate stable  predictable  and growing dividend income are going to continue to demand valuation premiums 
A good place to start is with those power and water utilities that provide that kind of juice   and more
