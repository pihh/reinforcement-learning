125559,347074,PXD,Oil up Third Day  Specter of Weakening Shale Adds to Rally,news,"Investing com   The rally in oil seems to be going and going  Another record high on the Dow  more trade deal hopes and suggestions that shale oil development could hit a low soon combined to give another crude prices a fresh boost Tuesday 
West Texas Intermediate settled up 69 cents  or 1 2   at  57 23 per barrel  It has gained 5 6  since Thursday  when it last settled lower 
London s Brent crude climbed 83 cents  or 1 3   to settle at  62 96  It rose 4 5  over the past three sessions 
  The overwhelming tendency to push the market up continues  and it s aided this time by another stock market high  continued hopes for a positive U S  China outcome and indications that output from key shale patches may be weakening   said John Kilduff  founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital 
Wall Street s best known stock index  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  hit all time peaks for a second straight session on Tuesday before consolidating gains after media reports suggesting U S  and Chinese officials appeared serious enough to clinch a partial trade deal by considering rolling back more tariffs than initially said 
  Pioneer Natural Resources    NYSE PXD  Chief Executive Scott Sheffield  meanwhile  said he expects the Permian Basin  the top U S  shale field  to  slow down significantly over the next several years  
 I don t think OPEC has to worry that much more about U S  shale growth long term   Sheffield said on Tuesday on a call with analysts  Reuters reported 
Shale has been the nemesis of OPEC over the past five years after all time highs in domestic U S  production prompted the cartel to cut output to keep global prices stable 
But U S  producers are now under pressure to trim spending and return profits to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks  The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has declined about 21  over the last year  according to last week s rig count report from Baker Hughes 
Analysts with a bullish view on oil  such as Price Futures Group s Phil Flynn  have been arguing almost daily in recent weeks that the seemingly infinite threat from shale has been overplayed 
Pioneer s Sheffield seemed to agree in principle to such arguments  saying that despite new production coming from Norway  Brazil and Guyana in the next year   There s not much coming on after  
 We re becoming more optimistic that we re probably at the bottom end of the cycle  in oil prices   he added 
Market participants are also looking out for inventory data on U S  crude and petroleum products due later in the day 
The American Petroleum Institute  API  will issue at 4 30 PM a snapshot of what the Energy Information Administration  EIA  will likely report as official petroleum supply demand balances for last week  Analysts surveyed by Investing com think crude stockpiles may have risen by as much as 1 5 million barrels for the week ",2019-11-05,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-up-3rd-day-specter-of-weakening-shale-adds-to-rally-2012577,2012577
125560,347075,PXD,U S  Boosts Oil Output Forecast While Industry Warns of Slowdown,news," Bloomberg     The pioneers of the U S  shale boom are warning of a slowdown in oil production growth  but it appears the U S  government doesn t agree 
The Energy Information Administration revised up its forecast for the growth rate for crude output in 2020 to 1 million barrels a day from 910 000 barrels a day in October  according to the monthly Short Term Energy Outlook on Wednesday 
The report came as a surprise given signs that companies are reining in spending to focus on shareholder returns rather than keep burning through cash 
 The EIA is not really convinced that s the case   said Bob Yawger  director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York   It seems to me that they will walk those numbers down  
Just hours earlier   Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD  Co  s Scott Sheffield expressed doubts that U S  oil output will meet the latest growth forecasts made by the International Energy Agency as producers rein in spending  speaking in an interview on Bloomberg TV  The IEA said Tuesday that the U S  will account for 85  of the growth in production worldwide to 2030 
And analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   said they see U S  output rising by 600 000 barrels a day next year  down from a previous estimate of 700 000 barrels ",2019-11-14,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-boosts-oiloutput-forecast-while-industry-warns-of-slowdown-2020552,2020552

recently featured in the blog include  Callon Petroleum Co    NYSE CPE    Diamondback Energy  Inc    NASDAQ FANG    Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   and Concho Resources   NYSE CXO   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  U S  Shale Drillers to Pump Up More Returns in 2020  4 GainersMarkets are betting high on incremental free cashflow from American shale explorers in 2020  This is because the companies have constrained capital expenditure programs as shareholders demand lower spending on production and instead focus more on returns Conservative Capital ProgramOil explorers and producers in the U S  shale plays have been removing rigs since they have been facing constant investor pressure for higher returns  In 2019  the upstream energy players removed roughly 200 rigs from American oil resources  per data provided by oilfield service firm Baker Hughes Company  BKR   Notably  Permian   the most prolific shale resource in the United States which has helped the country become energy independence   witnessed the removal of roughly 82 oil rigs in 2019 The shale operators have also decided to continue to curb spending on drilling new wells  which has slowed their overall production  Despite a relatively favorable crude pricing scenario  domestic oil explorers and producers have cut down on spending just to generate sufficient free cashflow for shareholders Impressive Free Cashflow in the CardsFree cashflow is derived after subtracting capital spending from net cash from operations  The continued restraint in capital spending has increased the possibility for U S  shale players to generate incremental free cashflows in 2020 Analysts are reportedly optimistic about higher investor returns from shale players since shareholders recently approved Parsley Energy Inc s  PE   1 8 billion acquisition of rival Jagged Peak Energy Inc  JAG   It might be the case that shareholders are optimistic that even after spending on mergers and acquisitions  domestic shale companies will have sufficient free cashflows to reward stockholders with dividends and share repurchases Shale Players to GainGiven that shale drillers will probably generate handsome free cashflows in 2020  it would be ideal to keep an eye on the following Permian explorers that are poised to gain  Here  we present one stock carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and

125579,347094,PXD,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this independent oil and gas company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Pioneer Natural Resources is 28 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 19 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 12 1  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Pioneer Natural Resources is 44 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 30 5  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12 2  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 5 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Pioneer Natural Resources have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 9 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Pioneer Natural Resources a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Pioneer Natural Resources is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2020-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-pioneer-natural-resources-pxd-is-a-solid-choice-200504087,200504087

trade deal in early January  Since October  West Texas intermediate  WTI  crude has gained more than 16  and has recently crossed the psychological  60 per barrel mark Easing Trade Tensions to Boost

billion worth of China goods   comprising toys  laptops  cell phones and clothing  Beijing  on its part  didn t proceed with the retaliatory tariffs of 25  on American autos that were set to go into effect on the same day Moreover  Washington has decided to halve the tariff rate levied on Sep 1 on a list of Chinese goods worth  120 billion to 7 5   However  to leverage negotiations for the second phase in 2020  Beijing has kept its 25  duty on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods in place In the next two years  Beijing will ramp up purchase of goods and services from Washington by at least  200 billion  added U S  officials  The list of goods to be purchased comprises manufactured goods  agricultural goods and energy  With this  the U S  officials believe that the country s  419 billion

economies agreed to the terms of the accord  Beijing unveiled a fresh list of six products from Washington that will be exempted from tariffs for a year since Dec 26   Overall  the phase one trade

total production cut of the energy alliance will be 2 1 million Bbl D  Investors should know that the oil producing nations will be implementing the additional supply cut from Jan 1  2020  through

Blog More Upside Awaits Oil in 2020  Share Drillers to GainA 17 month long tariff battle between the United States and China has threatened the global economy  denting worldwide energy demand  This prompted analysts to repeatedly cut next year s oil price projection   However  oil is now slowly gaining momentum on optimism that the two big economies will sign the phase one trade deal in early January  Since October  West Texas intermediate  WTI  crude has gained more than 16  and has recently crossed the psychological  60 per barrel mark Easing Trade Tensions to Boost Crude DemandWashington and Beijing recently agreed to the terms of a historic phase one trade deal  As part of the accord  the United States called off the Dec 15 implementation of 15  tariffs on  160 billion worth of China goods   comprising toys  laptops  cell phones and clothing  Beijing  on its part  didn t proceed with the retaliatory tariffs of 25  on American autos that were set to go into effect on the same day Moreover  Washington has decided to halve the tariff rate levied on Sep 1 on a list of Chinese goods worth  120 billion to 7 5   However  to leverage negotiations for the second phase in 2020  Beijing has kept its 25  duty on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods in place In the next two years  Beijing will ramp up purchase of goods and services from Washington by at least  200 billion  added U S  officials  The list of goods to be purchased comprises manufactured goods  agricultural goods and energy  With this  the U S  officials believe that the country s  419 billion trade deficit with China will be significantly lowered  which in turn will boost the nation s GDP Precisely  Beijing has vowed to step up its purchases of agriculture products from Washington by  32 billion in the next two years  Apart from the agricultural purchases  the agreement covers issues like intellectual property protection and technology transfers Further  days after the two big economies agreed to the terms of the accord  Beijing unveiled a fresh list of six products from Washington that will be exempted from tariffs for a year since Dec 26   Overall  the phase one trade deal  likely to be signed by the first week of January  has improved the outlook for global energy demand OPEC Agrees to Deepen Oil Output Cut In the seventh OPEC and non OPEC ministerial meeting in

total production cut of the energy alliance will be 2 1 million Bbl D  Investors should know that the oil producing nations will be implementing the additional supply cut from Jan 1  2020  through March 2020 Precisely  the cartel and its allies  latest agreement will tighten global oil supply US Drillers to GainWe can say that more upside awaits oil prices in 2020 as its demand outlook is

125633,347148,PXD,Exclusive  Occidental emerges as heavy hitter in U S  oil export boom,news,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Florence Tan NEW YORK HOUSTON  Reuters    Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  has emerged as one of the biggest exporters of U S  shale oil  rivaling large trading firms and oil majors  in a market now worth more than  150 million every day  It is showing no signs of slowing down  with plans to double crude exports to 600 000 barrels per day in 2020  Cynthia Walker  senior vice president midstream and marketing at Occidental  said in an interview    As we move into the end of this year and early in 2020     we ll probably see a doubling of exports over that period of time   she said  In 2017  Occidental was the largest exporter of crude produced in the Permian oilfield of Texas and New Mexico  the largest U S  oil field  from the U S  Gulf Coast   Through 2018  it remained one of the top three exporters of U S  crude  according to limited customs data on Refinitiv Eikon analyzed by Reuters and exclusive interviews with company executives and employees   Company level data on exports is notoriously guarded and kept secret  The U S  Census Bureau declined to provide data  citing a law which protects confidentiality   Occidental stands out among the myriad trading houses  oil producers and shippers with operations in the Permian  as it currently exports about 300 000 bpd of oil  roughly 10 percent of U S  crude exports   According to limited Customs data available on Refinitiv Eikon  other top shippers included Koch Supply and Trading   BP   LON BP  Plc s trading arm and Trafigura AG   Occidental produces significant volumes of oil in the Permian   and its marketing arm buys barrels from other Permian shale producers  In addition  it has contracts for long term shipments on pipelines and access to storage and export terminals as well   We touch anywhere between 20 and 25 percent of every barrel that s produced in the Permian basin   Walker said   EXPORT BOOM BRINGS OPPORTUNITY  U S  crude exports have skyrocketed after Washington lifted a decades long ban of exports in late 2015  rising at a rate faster than many anticipated to a record at about 3 6 million bpd last month   Graphic     U S  oil production has risen by more than 2 million bpd in the last 12 months  also to an all time high of over 12 million bpd  according to U S  Energy Department data  Given the country consumes several million barrels more than that daily  many analysts had assumed exports would grow more slowly   That has not been the case   exports have doubled from the end of 2017  a lucrative opportunity for companies with access to supply and export terminals   Companies are scrambling to build Gulf Coast ports to handle more than 3 million bpd in new supplies expected over the next five years  Profits at Occidental s midstream and marketing segment  which includes exports  surged more than seventeen fold to  1 9 billion in 2018  excluding items  mostly thanks to moving crude from the Permian to the refining and export hub in the Gulf Coast   As oil retreated to around  50 a barrel  Occident shares ended 2018 down more than 15 percent  closely tracking the weakness in oil prices   While Occidental cashed in last year  rivals ran into bottlenecks trying to get barrels from Permian to the Gulf Coast for export due to a lack of adequate pipeline access  That caused regional prices to slump  even as the price of U S  oil futures rose to more than  75 a barrel at one point  The bottleneck has since eased as companies expanded pipelines   Oxy has a 10 year service agreement with BridgeTex pipeline  a key conduit to move crude from the Permian  The company secured a deal for 200 000 bpd of space in 2012 and has financed the line s construction  Last year  Oxy not only sent its own barrels  but bought those of others   Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD  Co  a rival Permian producer  sold 17 percent of their production to Occidental Marketing in 2018  according to regulatory filings  Occidental also bought a massive 34 percent of the barrels Pioneer buys from other companies   The company also had the advantage of owning and operating a terminal in Ingleside  Corpus Christi  where it began testing supertanker export capabilities in 2017  Oxy later sold the terminal to Moda Midstream but has retained a 10 year contract for 450 000 bpd of exports at the oil export terminal  The company has the ability to send about 470 000 bpd out of the Permian via pipelines and expects to add more capacity in 2019  Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said at an industry conference last year   The port partially loaded its first supertanker   Nasiriyah chartered by Occidental for Europe   in December which helped slash costs for ship to ship transfers  a costly endeavor that has limited U S  exports because most Gulf terminals are not deep enough to handle the supertankers  known as Very Large Crude Carrier  VLCC  as they can transport 2 million barrels of oil  desired by Asian buyers   We don t worry at all about access   Walker said  adding that the company has a 75 cent per barrel advantage on loading costs due to the loading efficiencies at the Ingleside terminal   To boost its export capability  Moda is expanding its storage and considering building a second berth for VLCCs   We re trying to get as much to the Gulf and get it out of there   a source at Occidental said   
 We have the place that is easily accessible   at Ingleside   that really is what they re using to market to these foreign players in Asia  ",2019-03-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-occidental-emerges-as-heavy-hitter-in-us-oil-export-boom-1803188,1803188

the recent signs of moderation in American oil production growth  the country is poised to become energy independent by next year Shale Drillers to Back US  Energy IndependenceConservative capital spending by U S  oil explorers have slowed down drilling activities across the country s major shale plays  With a drop in rig count  shale resources have been witnessing a decline in crude production growth  In fact  the growth in production will continue to decelerate since most of the analysts are predicting a curtailment in future drilling programs Despite the slowdown  the overall production volumes of crude in America will be growing in the coming years  According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   from a record annual average volume of 11 million barrel per day  Bbl D  in 2018  the United States will increase average crude production to 12 3 million Bbl D in 2019  Also  the annual average U S  production volumes of the commodity in 2020 will rise to 13 2 million Bbl D  as estimated by EIA Precisely  the prolific shale plays in the United States  especially the Permian Basin  will continue to contribute to the country s crude production and hence has paved the way for America s energy independence  EIA added that from an average net import volume of 520 000 Bbl D of crude oil and petroleum in 2019  the United States will report net export volumes of the commodities at an annual average of 750 000 Bbl D in 2020 Oil Industry s Future Lies With AmericaAnalysts not only expect America to become a net exporter of oil in the years to come but also anticipate the United States to be among the few exporting countries to primarily contribute additional crude volumes to the global energy market  Meanwhile  OPEC projects production decline in its volumes for oil and other liquids over the next five years  OPEC estimates production of liquids at 32 8 million Bbl D in 2024  suggesting a decline from the current level of 35 million Bbl D Thus  in the production race for crude oil  the United States will be surpassing OPEC despite the slowdown in America s shale drilling activities  Precisely  when OPEC is planning to curb its annual average crude production to stabilize oil prices amid the global supply glut  the United States has decided to increase its production share in the global energy market Shale Drillers in Focus  America s

But are these values or traps 
Definition of a Value Trap Versus a Value Stock
Remember  to determine whether a stock is a true value  you have to look beyond the P E or the P S ratios 
Look at the earnings estimates  Are they on the rise from 2019 to 2020  Do analysts see earnings growth  or an earnings decline  next year 
Value investors want to get their companies cheap  but they also want growth 
A value stock is cheap but also has earnings growth

125659,347174,PXD,Shale Pains And Crude Gains,opinion,"The crude oil price gained on reports of more shale pain along with reports that Saudi Arabia wants to cut production and an American Petroleum Institute report that showed a big build in crude supply but a disturbing drop in gasoline and distillate 
The API seemed to suggest that American refiners are not keeping up with strong demand  leading to a 4 17 million barrel drop in gasoline supply and another 1 65 million barrel drop in distillate supply  The big drops in products overshadowed a much bigger than expected 4 26 million barrel increase in crude supply that was enhanced with a 1 25 million barrel increase in the Cushing  Oklahoma hub  That is the 5th increase in a row at Cushing and can be blamed on the Keystone pipeline leak 
Still  the build in crude oil is a concern because it looks like refiners are not building product supply  While the drop in distillate is not massive  it is sending warning signals that the impact of the IMO rules are going to come at a hefty cost  It also shows that refiners focus on those new rules that may come at the expense of gasoline  In this type of environment  it is best to be hedged if you are not all ready 
The 177th OPEC meeting is scheduled for December 5th in Vienna  Austria with the OPEC and non OPEC ministerial meeting scheduled for the next day  It seems that as we get closer to that meeting  we are getting conflicting signals about what is actually going to happen  Yesterday the OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo seemed to suggest that the outlook for oil was more bullish for 2020 and that a further production cut may not be needed  Yet according to today s Wall Street Journal  the Saudis see it another way and are pushing for a bigger cut  I am sure the Saudi Aramco IPO has nothing to do with their desire for a cut because as the Saudis have often told us  there is no price manipulation that they are after but only price stability for consumers and producers 
The big question then will be whether Saudi Arabia can convince other OPEC members to toe the line  One sign that might happen is that Iran  Saudi Arabia s traditional foe in and out of OPEC  seems to be on board for a cut  Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted by Reuters as saying on Monday that he expects further production cuts to be agreed to at the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  in December  We also have commitments from Iraq and Nigeria to rein in overproduction  Yet to get a cut done  the Saudis may have to kiss Vladimir Putin s ring  because if it s going to work  they are going to need Russia  Maybe they can offer Vladimir a few shares of Saudi Aramco 
Of course  talk of a cut comes against a backdrop of OPEC s own admission that they are losing market share due in part to U S  shale oil  Yet could a cut by OPEC signal that they see the threat from U S  shale as diminishing   Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD  Chief Executive Scott Sheffield seems to think so  Investing com reported that  Pioneer Natural Resources Co  NYSE PXD  Chief Executive Scott Sheffield  meanwhile  said he expects the Permian Basin  the top U S  shale field  to  slow down significantly over the next several years    I don t think OPEC has to worry that much more about U S  shale growth long term   Sheffield said on Tuesday on a call with analysts  Reuters reported 
Shale has been the nemesis of OPEC over the past five years after all time highs in domestic U S  production prompted the cartel to cut output to keep global prices stable  But U S  producers are now under pressure to trim spending and return profits to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks  The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has declined about 21  over the last year  according to last week s rig count report from Baker Hughes  Analysts with a bullish view on oil  such as Price Futures Group s Phil Flynn  have been arguing almost daily in recent weeks that the seemingly infinite threat from shale has been overplayed  Pioneer s Sheffield seemed to agree in principle to such arguments  saying that despite new production coming from Norway  Brazil  and Guyana in the next year   There s not much coming on after    We re becoming more optimistic that we re probably at the bottom end of the cycle  in oil prices   he added 
Ah yes  the old oil cycle  Throughout history  no matter what the innovation  the oil market always cycles  Long term the lack of investment in traditional oil wells and an over reliance on shale does suggest that long term we are at the bottom of a cycle  Actually  we have been since oil bottomed around  25 00 a barrel a few years ago  Still  the bottoming action has been fraught with a multitude of factors that have caught us in a range in the short term  Yet as refiners come out of maintenance  we should be at the bottom for a new run 
A new milestone for Freedom Gas and or LNG as some call it  according to Natural Gas Intelligence   Canada fell far behind the United States in the natural gas export arena during the first six months of 2019  according to the latest trade scorecard of the U S  Department of Energy  DOE   U S  exports reached 31 markets and grew by 27   But the United States remained the sole destination for Canadian gas exports  and they shrank by 7   First half 2019 U S  exports were 2 13 Tcf or 11 8 Bcf d  compared with 1 68 Tcf or 9 3 Bcf d in the same period of 2018  DOE said  Canadian exports dropped to 1 41 Tcf or 7 8 Bcf d from January through June versus year ago exports of 1 52 Tcf or 8 4 Bcf d  The increased U S  exports included liquefied natural gas  LNG  ocean tanker and ship container deliveries to 29 countries  as well as pipeline  flows to Canada and Mexico  First half 2019 U S  LNG exports rose by 57 5  to 774 1 Bcf or 4 3 Bcf d from 491 4 Bcf d or 2 7 Bcf d in the first six months of 2018  American gas exports to Mexico rose by 10 4  to 883 3 Bcf or 4 9 Bcf d in the first half of this year from 800 2 Bcf or 4 4 Bcf d a year earlier  U S  pipeline exports to Canada climbed by 22 4  to 475 3 Bcf or 2 6 Bcf d in the first six months of this year from 388 4 Bcf or 2 1 Bcf d in first half 2018  For Canadian exporters  improved prices offset their sales volume erosion  At the U S  border  Canadian gas rose by 14 6  to a first half 2019 average of  2 72 MMBtu from  2 37 MMBtu in the same period of 2018  Prices fetched by U S  exports to Canada slipped by a penny or 0 4  to  3 09 MMBtu in first half 2019 from  3 10 MMBtu in the same period of 2018  Natural Gas Intelligence says the  Mexican market was less kind  The first half 2019 average price for U S  pipeline exports to Mexico dropped by 11 7  to  2 82 MMBtu from  3 20 MMBtu during the comparable 2018 period  Prices fetched by U S  LNG cargoes varied widely across their 29 destinations from  2 95 MMBtu in Jamaica to  10 for small volumes sent on container ships to Haiti  the Bahama Islands  and Barbados 
More than half of U S  LNG exports were destined for South Korea  Mexico  Spain  Chile  Japan  and the Netherlands  DOE said

125660,347175,PXD,U S  Oil Production Plateauing  Watch Player Reactions To Forecasts To Know,opinion,"One of the top questions plaguing oil forecasters right now is how much of the commodity the U S  will produce in 2020  Since the fracking revolution began  U S  production has climbed every year  recently  a high of 12 6 million bpd  
Nevertheless  there are indications that the incredible boom in the shale oil industry may be about to and forecasters are struggling with how to quantify this 
U S  Crude Production Estimates Lifted As Shale Outlook Cut
The latest controversial call comes from the EIA  which  recently lifted its projections for U S  crude oil production in 2020 from an average 13 17 million bpd to 13 29 million bpd  The EIA s move to raise projections rather than lowering them is a subject of great scrutiny  In fact  on Nov  13th  Scott Sheffield  the CEO of  Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD   called the EIA  way too optimistic  in terms of its estimations for U S  oil production growth 

Goldman Sachs recently trimmed its growth projections for U S  shale output in 2020  The investment bank now expects that shale oil production will increase by just 700 000 bpd in 2020  down from its previous forecast of 1 million bpd growth  IHS Markit has also wound back its forecast for U S  oil production and now predicts gains of just 440 000 bpd in 2020 
OPEC Secretary Mohammed Barkindo weighed in on this subject and with Scott Sheffield  Earlier this week  he told CNBC that after talking to  a number of producers  especially in the shale basin  there is a growing concern by themselves that the slowdown is almost graduating into a fast deceleration   Barkindo added that these companies  are telling us that we are probably more optimistic than they are considering the variety of headwind challenges they are facing

When confronted with this information  traders must remember that the actual projections are essentially meaningless  In fact  they will almost certainly be proven wrong when we see the real production numbers in 2020  No one will recall whether HIS Markit  Goldman Sachs or the EIA was closer to the mark with its November U S  oil production forecasts for 2020 
Forecasts Alone Are Insignificant  But   
The significance of these calls is in observing the reactions from key decision makers whose actions can impact future oil production  For example  Barkindo s statement provides insight into OPEC s thinking  Shale oil production forecasts are taken into consideration by OPEC when making decisions about production quotas  so if there is strong sentiment within OPEC that shale oil production is likely to level off in the near future  there will be little impetus to push for deeper production cuts at the December meeting 

Another issue traders need to consider is whether shale oil companies are being overly dramatic in expressing their growth concerns  These could be tactics designed to reduce analysts  expectations  so when these companies reveal their Q4 earnings  their share prices won t drop nearly as much  With Chesapeake Energy s  NYSE CHK  share price so low that it is about to be delisted from the stock exchange  it wouldn t be surprising to see similar oil producers actively trying to decrease expectations ",2019-11-14,"Ellen R.

125669,347184,PXD,Gloves back on  OPEC and U S  shale producers to deepen ties in Vienna,news,"By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON  Reuters    Only a few years ago  shale CEOs and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries were in open conflict  Now  they realize they re in the same boat and need to row in tandem to keep global crude supply and demand in balance  according to interviews with analysts  executives and investors   The recent rise in crude prices  LCOc1   CLc1    up more than 40 percent in the past year   has lifted profits for producers across the globe  but also threatens to erode demand for fossil fuels at a time when electrification is becoming commonplace    We re getting to a point where a continued rise in the oil price is going to cause major problems for the global economy   said Amy Meyers Jaffe  director of the program on energy security and climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations    There are bigger issues at hand besides output that OPEC and shale producers care about   OPEC and U S  representatives have met at least twice this year  with a third high profile meeting set for Vienna next week  Finding the optimal balance of crude supply and demand will be the hot topic  Harold Hamm  the billionaire founder of U S  shale pioneer  Continental Resources Inc   N CLR   is due to address OPEC ministers  along with fellow shale executives  Hess Corp   N HES  CEO John Hess and Pioneer Natural Resource Co  N PXD  Executive Chairman Scott Sheffield  Hamm and Hess did not respond to requests for comment ahead of the meeting  Sheffield declined to comment   I wouldn t take dialogue and discussion as any kind of collaboration  We re all talking about what does world demand look like for oil   said U S  Senator Heidi Heitkamp  a North Dakota Democrat who successfully pushed to lift the U S  oil export ban in 2015   Lifting that ban ushered in a sea change in global energy  sending nearly 2 million barrels of U S  crude to India  China and other markets historically dominated by OPEC and forcing the group and its American rivals to be more conciliatory  Hamm  who called OPEC a  toothless tiger  in 2014  has begun encouraging fellow shale companies to focus more on profitability and less on profligate production  Last month  Hamm addressed a Saudi Aramco board meeting in Houston  It was a change in tone for Hamm  who in 2011 erected a granite monument on the windswept plains of North Dakota that boasted of the rising clout of U S  oil production and the nation s ability to supply its own energy   The monument to one of the first horizontal shale wells drilled in the United States bragged that Continental had helped dispel  the myth that America was running out of oil  and would help the country beat global competitors   Khalid al Falih  chairman of state oil giant Aramco and the Saudi energy minister  will be in Vienna along with fellow OPEC ministers to debate whether to extend recent production curbs   U S  shale executives will not be part of those discussions  but will meet elsewhere in Vienna during the week with Falih and other OPEC ministers   STABLE  NOT HIGHER U S  shale producers are prohibited by antitrust law from coordinating their output  making their desire with OPEC to curb volatility and price spikes a difficult one   U S  oil and gas producers need stable oil prices to be successful  not necessarily higher oil prices   said Rob Thummel  portfolio manager of Tortoise Energy Independence Fund  N NDP   which holds shares of Pioneer and other U S  producers  Indeed  some U S  executives are staying away from Vienna  Mark Papa  the CEO of Centennial Resource Development Inc  O CDEV   and Ryan Lance  CEO of ConocoPhillips  N COP   had been slated to attend but backed out  Lance had been due to speak on a panel with several Persian Gulf producers  but grew concerned that it would seem as if he were the designate U S  representative at such a forum  according to a source familiar with the company s thinking  Conoco declined to comment  Papa did not respond to a request for comment   OPEC ministers are expected to question the U S  shale executives about rising output from the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico  the largest U S  oilfield  which pumps more than 3 million barrels per day   There is a tsunami of oil coming from the Permian   said Pete Bowden  global head of energy investment banking at Jefferies   That is a game changer  not just for the industry domestically  but for international oil and gas supply demand dynamics   With U S  crude exports at a record high  rising Permian production has become more of a concern for OPEC than at any time in history   We expect that they  U S  shale producers  remain independent and do what s in the best interest of their country   Senator Heitkamp said   We re not going to join OPEC  and we re going to be fiercely competing with them    That competition  though  increasingly includes a realization that the fate of both sides is tied

125676,347191,PXD,U S  shale investors still waiting on payoff from oil boom,news,"By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON  Reuters    U S  oil production has topped 10 million barrels per day  approaching a record set in 1970  but many investors in the companies driving the shale oil revolution are still waiting for their payday  Shale producers have raised and spent billions of dollars to produce more oil and gas  ending decades of declining output and redrawing the global energy trade map  But most U S  shale producers have failed for years to turn a profit with the increased output  frustrating their financial backers  Wall Street s patience ran out late last year as investors called for producers to shift more cash to dividends and share buybacks    Give me some cash  please   That s what investors have said   said Anoop Poddar  a partner at private equity firm Energy Ventures  And yet such calls for payouts remain a debate in the industry as oil prices have recently creeped up to four year highs  Investors demanding immediate returns could risk forcing firms to curb expansion that could have a higher long term payoff if oil prices continue to rise   For an interactive graphic charting the global impacts of the U S  shale oil boom  see     For now  share prices of shale producers have yet to fully recover from the 2014 oil price  CLc1  collapse  when many investors took losses as hundreds of firms went bankrupt and those that survived struggled  The energy sector has lagged the rally that took the broader stock market to record highs  The S P 500 Energy Index  SPNY  remains nearly a third off its peak in mid 2014  when oil prices  CLc1   LCOc1  topped  100 a barrel  The broader S P 500 index  INX  is up 39 percent during the same period  A Reuters analysis of corporate dividend disclosures shows a split in how shale firms are reacting to increased pressure from investors   and the impact on their market value  This year  five of the 15 largest U S  independent shale firms have started paying or raised quarterly dividends  the documents show  But six of the firms have never offered a dividend or have not restored cuts implemented since the 2014 oil price collapse  Anadarko Petroleum Corp  N APC  earlier this month added  500 million to an existing buyback program and raised its dividend by 20 percent  sending its shares up 4 5 percent the next trading day  Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding  boosting the value of stock that remains   Shares in  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD  also rose 4 percent immediately after raising its dividend four fold and posting better than forecast fourth quarter results earlier this month  Tim Dove  Pioneer s chief executive  called the increase  a step toward our goal of returning cash to shareholders   Companies that have resisted boosting dividends  by contrast  have seen their valuations fall  Of the six  shares in four    Cimarex Energy  Co  N XEC    Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN    Parsley Energy  Inc  N PE  and  Noble Energy  Inc  N NBL    have lost at least 19 percent in the last 12 months  Only one   Continental Resources Inc   N CLR   is higher than a year ago   Four producers  including  Hess Corp   N HES   kept dividends steady through the downturn  A PASS FOR SMALL  HIGH GROWTH FIRMS Recent oil price gains have eased the pressure from shareholders  In January  U S  oil futures  CLc1  jumped to  66 14 a barrel  up 56 percent from last year s low and at a level not seen in four years  Since then  prices have cooled to about  63 a barrel  but remain 17 percent above a year ago  boosting cash flow for firms that have expanded output   A lot of these smaller companies have gotten a pass for outspending cash flow due to their very high growth rates   said Todd Heltman of asset manager Neuberger Berman  which invests in shale producers  Shale output growth continues to outpace forecasts  The U S  Energy Information Administration this month said United States production could top 11 million barrels per day by the end of 2018  a year earlier than it had expected just a month ago   Heltman has pressed shale firms to show restraint even amid rising prices  And despite higher revenues  spending increases have so far been restrained  Producers have pushed up spending plans for all of 2018 by 10 percent over last year  according to a tally of 41 of the 65 producers tracked by financial services firm Cowen   Co  Some companies have maintained conservative assumptions for the average oil price for 2018  budgeting for prices between  50 and  55 a barrel  A higher price will mean they can cover new drilling investments and still pay dividends   Investors are searching for firms that can find the optimal balance between the conflicting goals of controlling costs  paying dividends and increasing production   We re looking to invest in those companies who have been able to improve their production and win the battle as far as cost of extraction   said Derek Rollingson  portfolio manager of the ICON Energy Fund  O ICENX   which holds shares of more than a dozen U S  shale producers  A further rise in oil prices  however  could lead investors to take on more risk and penalize more conservative companies  said Mike Breard  an energy analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas

125682,347197,PXD,Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 4  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 43 billion  down 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 45  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pioneer Natural Resources 
For Pioneer Natural Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 51  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Pioneer Natural Resources will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Pioneer Natural Resources would post earnings of  1 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 01  delivering a surprise of  6 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

125714,347229,PXD,5 U S  Shale Producers In Focus On Saudi Oil Disruptions,opinion,The weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia s energy installations shook up the world of oil Drone Strikes on Saudi Oil FacilitiesOn Saturday  unmanned aerial vehicles struck the state run Saudi Arabian Oil Company s  Aramco  Abqaiq plant   a key crude processing facility   and the Khurais complex  which houses the kingdom s second largest oilfield  The Iran backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen  who have attacked Saudi targets in the past because of an ongoing conflict  claimed responsibility for the explosions  However  U S  Secretary of State Michael Pompeo accused Iran directly for the assault Massive Supply DisruptionThe Abqaiq plant has a capacity to process approximately 7 million barrels of oil a day  or roughly 7  of the global crude volumes  while Khurais boasts of a daily production capacity of around 1 5 million barrels with estimated reserves of more than 20 billion barrels of oil  As a result  the strikes hit the Saudi energy infrastructure hard  cutting the kingdom s oil production by around 50   This loss amounts to a staggering 5 million barrels of daily crude output  or 5  of the world s oil supply    Crude Price SoarsSuch is the extent of damage that it is touted as the  single worst sudden disruption ever  for the oil markets  surpassing the impact of the 1991 Persian

Boon for U S  Oil CompaniesWhile Saudi Arabia is expected to bring back a major portion of the suspended oil output within days  it will possibly require weeks to restore 100  production  In the meantime  there could be some windfall gains for the American shale players  To their advantage  the Abqaiq plant and the Khurais oilfield   under temporary suspensions   process and produce a light oil comparable to the ones churned out by the U S  shale companies  As it is  the upstream oil companies are best positioned to benefit from the oil surge 5 Shale Producers in FocusThe Saudi Arabian supply shock has put the oil market in a fundamentally tight spot and is likely to breathe life back into the sector  Below we present five companies   each focused on one or the other major oil

the void in world supply on account of drone attacks on two Saudi Aramco oil facilities You can see  Investors should know that the Bakken and Eagle Ford  together with the Permian Basin constitutes around 90  of total shale oil production domestically  In particular  the Permian shale play accounts for roughly one third of the total U S  oil output and is the dominant domestic growth area for onshore oil production EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   is the largest crude producer and acreage holder in the Eagle Ford shale  boasting of more than 500 000 net acres  The company has identified 7

already realized production growth of 71  in the past year with Chevron targeting output of 900 000 barrels per day in 2023  Investors should also note that Chevron s Permian production of 421 000 barrels per day in the second quarter was up 55  from last year s corresponding period Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO   has 145 000 net acres in the Eagle Ford  In the second quarter  Marathon

125716,347231,PXD,Should Value Investors Pick Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Pioneer Natural Resources has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 41  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 84  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Pioneer Natural Resources  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Oil   Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 88  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Pioneer Natural Resources has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Pioneer Natural Resources stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Pioneer Natural Resources has a P S ratio of about

If anything  PXD is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Pioneer Natural Resources currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Pioneer Natural Resources a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for Pioneer Natural Resources is just 0 70  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 82  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  PXD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles    What About the Stock Overall    Though Pioneer Natural Resources might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F  This gives PXD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to three higher while the current year estimate has seen six downward revision compared to five upward in the same time period      This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 4  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has declined by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Pioneer Natural Resources is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 29  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating

125718,347233,PXD,Why Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD   This company  which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This independent oil and gas company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10 29  
For the most recent quarter  Pioneer Natural Resources was expected to post earnings of  1 88 per share  but it reported  2 01 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 91   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 61 per share  while it actually produced  1 83 per share  a surprise of 13 66  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Pioneer Natural Resources lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Pioneer Natural Resources has an Earnings ESP of  1 47  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 4  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pioneer-natural-resources-pxd-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200475829,200475829

125742,347257,PXD,The Wheels Come Off Shale Oil,opinion,"A flurry of coverage about the gloom and outright calamity in the shale oil business appeared last week  Low prices continue to dog the industry  But so does lack of investor interest in financing loss making operations for yet another season   portend  if circumstances don t change 
I received considerable pushback last January when   The almost constant refrain of the cheerleaders for the shale oil industry has been that increasing production demonstrates there is something wrong with my analysis and that of others who have been skeptical of the industry s claims 
We skeptics have certainly been wrong about how long the boom could go on  We could not fathom why investors kept funneling capital into  
I can remember when Alan Greenspan  the former U S  Federal Reserve Bank chair   in the U S  stock market  His speech turned out to be only an inflection point for the technology sector boom  The tech heavy NASDAQ stock exchange rose 288 percent between the day Greenspan spoke and the index s peak in March 2000 
In the subsequent bust the bankruptcy courts were littered with companies that had never made dime 
So far this summer season we have heard two unthinkable utterances come from shale oil industry executives  The first linked above was that the industry has destroyed 80 percent of the capital entrusted to it since 2008  This came from a CEO no longer in the industry 
The second  however  came from one of the largest players in the Permian Basin  the hotbed of shale oil activity   Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD  CEO Scott Sheffield said that   That s oil speak for  sweet spots   Those are the circumscribed areas in shale deposits within which extraction costs are low enough to justify drilling 
Outside the sweet spots there is oil  but it is much more costly to extract  The industry at one time likened shale oil production to a manufacturing operation  claiming the one could drill practically anywhere in a shale deposit and get oil out profitably  No one is making such claims credibly any more 
Now  just two years ago the same Scott Sheffield mentioned above   To be fair to Mr  Sheffield  his job is to attract investors so he can drill more wells  So  I fault mostly the investors for not looking carefully at the economics of shale oil which have been free cash flow negative for the industry as a whole for almost a decade 
Some have called shale oil a Ponzi scheme  In a Ponzi scheme the books of the Ponzi operator are kept hidden from the investors so as to make sure they don t catch on that money from new investors is being used to pay exorbitant returns to old ones  In the case of shale oil  the financials were published quarterly by the publicly traded companies for all to see  And  the wealth extracted by company managements could be calculated practically to the penny 
So  why didn t investors understand what they were looking at  One possible explanation comes from an oil company executive who explained to me way back in 2009 that   They drill a lot of very marginal prospects to get reserves on their books and then tout the growth in their reserves  But much of those reserves will never be exploited at a profit  They are essentially a mirage 
Resource investing is tricky and most investors  even sophisticated ones  can be fooled by the hype  It s very difficult to know whether something a company calls a reserve is actually a reserve even more so since 2008 when the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed companies to use  that are not subject to disclosure 
It s true that the amount of oil in any one formation can be huge  But that is of no practical consequence if you can t get the oil out at a profit and do that consistently 
To illustrate  there is  to make all those who are reading this piece millionaires  But the gold remains far too costly to extract 
It seems now that investors are finally realizing that the promise of most of these  asset plays  is never going to be realized   Even a cheerleading trade publication last week ran a piece entitled 
We skeptics said shale oil would not work on the so called  manufacturing model  asserted by industry  It turned out we skeptics were right  The industry actually focused on  sweet spots  that allowed lower cost extraction 
We skeptics said that a large portion of the sweet spots would probably be exploited within a decade or so depending on the pace of drilling and the price oil  Now one of the industry s most prominent CEOs is lamenting in public about the paucity of sweet spots remaining 
We skeptics said that investors would at some point realize that shale oil was a long term money loser  A former industry CEO did the math and calculated the damage as minus 80 percent for investors in the industry as a whole since 2008  Lately  investors seem to be reacting to facts rather than the hype 
Will shale oil rise again from the dead as it did after the 2014 2016 price decline  That will happen only if two things occur  1  The oil price rises significantly and 2  investors have a serious bout of amnesia ",2019-08-12,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-wheels-come-off-shale-oil-200454043,200454043
125743,347258,PXD,The Energy Report  Monday Blues,opinion,"Crude Oil gave in to the Monday blues after holding steady most of the night before going south  The move followed a tanking U S  stock market that seems to be worried that a U S  China trade deal won t get done  President Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and suggested that the scheduled September talks could be canceled  Of course  China has other things on their mind as protests in Hong Kong turn increasingly violent 
The Chinese government canceled flights as protestors stormed the airport  China s President Xi Jinping is having a harder time keeping things together as his hardline policies on trade and Hong Kong are actually making him look ineffective and weak  Trump s threat to cancel negotiations came after the International Monetary Fund on Friday warned of downside risks to the Chinese economy if trade tensions escalate 
In the meantime  U S  oil producers continue to pull back as they struggle to make a profit with costs rising and oil prices stagnate  Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the U S  oil rig count fell for the 6th week in a row by 6 rigs  That brings the U S  rig count down to 764 last week  and that is down by 124 rigs or 14  since the high in Nov 2018 
Reuters reported that  Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD N   one of the largest U S  independent oil producers  on Wednesday warned that the shale boom could end by 2025 in all but one area of the Permian Basin  the country s largest shale field  as oil prices remain low and many producers pull back on drilling  Baker Hughes reported that the number of active gas rigs fell by 2 to reach 169  This means that the trends in the oil patch is for less oil production  That may matter  assuming rate cuts kick in and the global stock markets are steady 
Bloomberg News reports that OPEC will be watching the Energy Information Administration s shale output forecasts with bated breath today  With production showing no signs of a letup  even after drillers cut more than 100 rigs this year  the continued expansion would only heighten the need for more action from the cartel and its allies  Bernstein said an extra 1 0 million barrels a day of output cuts in 2020 would help defend prices at  60 00 a barrel 
The Wall Street Journal reports that Saudi Aramco is buying a 20  stake  worth some  15 billion including debt  in India s Reliance Industries oil and chemical business  a move that would help match its enormous crude production with refining capacity  as it gears back up for a planned initial public offering  The move would represent one of Aramco s biggest forays overseas and comes as it is trying to win over potential global investors for a possible listing that is now back on the front burner among Aramco executives and Saudi government officials  Aramco and Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani said the transaction was still subject to due diligence and a definitive agreement  The deal values Reliance s energy business at  75 billion  including debt  they said 
The Wall Street Journal also reported that Saudi Aramco said net earnings for the first half of 2019 were  46 9 billion  down just over 11  from  53 billion in the year earlier period  due to lower oil prices  The company  owned by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia  is conducting its first ever earnings call later Monday  The process is aimed at boosting transparency among potential investors ahead of its planned IPO  The listing  a key pillar of the company s economic diversity drive  has languished amid questions overvaluation and the venue for any IPO  Recently though  planning has revved back up again  The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Aramco was speeding up the timing for a potential listing to as early as next year

125745,347260,PXD,Oil   Gas US E P Outlook  Bearish Signals Abound,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of companies based in the United States focused on exploration and production  E P  of oil and natural gas  These firms are engaged in finding hydrocarbon reservoirs  drilling oil and gas wells  and producing and selling these materials to be refined later into products such as gasoline Some of the prominent stocks in this industry are Apache Corporation  NYSE APA   APA   Devon Energy Corporation  NYSE DVN   DVN   EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG    EOG   Noble Energy Inc  NYSE NBL    NBL   Concho Resources  NYSE CXO  Inc   CXO  and Cimarex Energy Co  NYSE XEC    XEC  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes  There is increasing evidence that a fundamental change is occurring in the oil market  WTI crude  the U S  benchmark  popped above  76 a barrel and was trading at multiyear highs in early October last year  A looming shortage of the commodity on Iran sanctions helped in driving oil prices higher  Now  in a reversal  oil is facing a two pronged attack  rising domestic supply and fears of a global economic slowdown against the backdrop of the U S  China trade war  This  by extension  translates into a bearish demand growth outlook  Currently trading at around  56 a barrel  crude is down approximately 15  from its 2019 peak back in April  While the future direction of crude s movement is anybody s guess  it might be prudent for investors to maintain caution in these uncertain times   either withdraw for a while or look for fundamentally sound stocks  Meanwhile  bearishness continues to grip the natural gas market  Prices recently fell to levels not seen in more than three years  reflecting a steady  albeit slow  descent  Market participants are worried that even a spike in heating demand might not be enough to stop the commodity s collapse below the psychologically important  2 per MMBtu level shortly  Agreed  the fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable on growing demand by electrical utilities  booming exports to Mexico  large scale liquefied gas export facilities and higher usage from industrial projects  However  record high production in the United States and expectations for healthy growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  natural gas prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements  In other words  any powerful turnaround looks unlikely at the moment  Over the past few years  energy producers worked tirelessly to cut costs to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable terms from the beleaguered service producers  Moreover  driven by operational efficiencies  most E P operators have been able to reduce unit costs and live within their cash flows  All of these factors  together with production growth and capital discipline have resulted in healthy free cash flows  With cash generation expected to remain robust even at relatively low oil prices  there is strong potential for greater return of capital to shareholders through dividend growth and stock buybacks  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas   US E P is a 72 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  200  which places it in the bottom 22  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates dim near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group s earnings growth potential  While the industry s earnings estimates for 2019 have decreased 55  in the past year  the same for 2020 have slumped 49 4  over the same period Despite the bleak near term prospects of the industry  we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas   US E P industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 48 4  over this period compared to the S P 500 s marginal gain of 0 9  and broader sector s decrease of 21 5  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current Valuation  Since oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt  For capital intensive companies  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 6 35X  lower than the S P 500 s 10 89X  It is  however  well above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 4 62X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 17 08X  as low as 4 75X  with a median of 7 86X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio   Bottom LineDespite OPEC s continued production cut pledge  the bearish price action indicates speculators are betting on weak demand  Indeed  the closely watched monthly reports from three key agencies  EIA  OPEC and the IEA  raised concerns about demand  primarily citing a slowing economic backdrop amid the U S  China trade spat  Even heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East has done little to prop up prices However  certain industry observers believe that the current selloff is too severe and expect prices to recover gradually  The drawdown in inventories in recent months indicates that the market is tighter than everyone thinks  Moreover  greater financial discipline practiced by the energy companies have raised expectations that supply growth could slow down sooner than later Natural gas futures  meanwhile  are likely to remain sedate on

125761,347276,PXD,As Trump targets energy rules  oil companies downplay their impact,news,"By Richard Valdmanis BOSTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil  But the top U S  oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business  according to a Reuters review of U S  securities filings from the top producers  In annual reports to the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  13 of the 15 biggest U S  oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition   The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation  but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue  The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump s war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output  as he has promised  or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies  as some investors have hoped  According to the SEC  a publicly traded company must deem a matter  material  and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important   Materiality is a fairly low bar   said Cary Coglianese  a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university s research program on regulation   Despite exaggerated claims  regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies  cost of doing business   The oil majors  annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel consumption  curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy  Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration s policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil   Under my presidency  we will accomplish complete American energy independence   said Trump  describing regulation as a  self inflicted wound   The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order   dubbed the  Energy Independence  executive order   to roll back Obama era regulations  which could be signed as early as this month  according to administration officials  U S  presidents have aimed to reduce U S  dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s  which triggered soaring prices  But the United States still imports about 7 9 million barrels of crude oil a day   almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined   ENERGY RENAISSANCE  The Trump administration s attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry   We haven t seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years  and I think part of the reason is that we ve had a heavy dose of regulation    Chevron  Corp   N CVX  CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek  a global energy conference in Houston this month  Continental Resources  N CLR  CEO  Harold Hamm  who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House  told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas  triggering a new  American energy renaissance   Yet Continental s annual report  filed last month with the SEC  says environmental regulation   after eight years under the Obama administration   does not have a  material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors   Continental s competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues  Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits  A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity or financial position  But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless   Changing  excessive  overlapping  duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs  cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions  with great cost to consumers of energy   the spokesman  Daren Beaudo  said in a written statement  The American Petroleum Institute   which represents the U S  oil and gas industry   also declined to comment  Last month  before the U S  Senate Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee  API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration   Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry   Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama  oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency  That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing  a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough to  reach shale formations  The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices  CLc1  from a high of over  100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly  25 by 2016  Current prices hover near  50 a barrel  NO  MATERIAL  IMPACT Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters   including new equipment or facilities  as well as fines and compliance staffing   amounted to a small fraction of revenues   Exxon Mobil   N XOM  reported spending  4 9 billion worldwide in 2016  or about 2 24 percent of gross revenue  Occidental Petroleum  N OXY   a much smaller company  reported spending  285 million  or about 2 82 percent of revenue  Neither addressed whether the spending was  material  in their filings  Two other companies  ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Chevron  also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business  Conoco spent  627 million in 2016  or about 2 57 percent of gross revenue  while Chevron spent  2 1 billion  or 1 91 percent of gross revenue  The other 11 companies did not break out spending  but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business  In one typical statement  EOG Resources  N EOG   one of the biggest U S  producers  told investors in a report filed last month   Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG s overall cost of business  but has not had  to date  a material adverse effect on EOG s operations  financial condition or results of operations     Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN   Anadarko Petroleum Corp  N APC    Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD    Apache Corp   N APA   and other large U S  focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording   ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE  Still  Obama s exit   and Trump s win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November   has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors   I believe the absence of a negative is a positive   John Dowd  who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments  wrote in his 2017 energy outlook   The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking  and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome   Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking  Other segments of the energy industry  such as coal mining and oil refining  were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama s presidency  Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama s climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand  Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline  Still  some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries  too  tend to be supply and demand   not regulation  The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country  since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U S  power plants  For refiners  the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material  crude oil  and the fuels they make with it   Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets   said Coglianese  the University of Pennsylvania law professor   Regulation is relatively trivial

What s Next for Pioneer Natural Resources 
While Pioneer Natural Resources has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

125794,347309,PXD,U S  shale oil s Achilles heel shows signs of mending,news,"By Ernest Scheyder and Terry Wade HOUSTON  Reuters    Since the beginning of the U S  fracking revolution  oil producers have struggled with a vexing problem  after an initial burst  crude output from new shale wells falls much faster than from conventional wells   However  those well decline rates have been slowing across the United States over the past few years  according to data analysis provided exclusively to Reuters   The trend  if sustained  would help ameliorate the industry s most glaring weakness and cement its importance for worldwide production in years to come  It also helps explain shale drillers  resilience throughout the oil market s two year slump   While shale oil production revolutionized the oil industry over the past decade  bringing abundance of global oil supplies  high costs and rapid production declines have been its Achilles heel  That is beginning to change thanks to technological innovation and producers  focusing less on maximizing output and more on improving efficiency and productivity  According to data compiled and analyzed by oilfield analytics firm NavPort for Reuters  output from the average new well in the Permian Basin of West Texas  the top U S  oilfield  declined 18 percent from peak production through the fourth month of its life in 2015  That is much slower than the 31 percent drop seen for the same time frame in 2012 and the 28 percent decline in 2013  when the oil price crash started  The change was even more dramatic in North Dakota s Bakken shale  where four month decline rates for new wells fell to 16 percent in 2015 from almost 31 percent in 2012   Graphic   A slower decline means producers need to drill fewer new wells to sustain output  said Mukul Sharma  professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas at Austin   You can have cash flow without having to expend a lot of capital   The recent decline rates mark a dramatic improvement from first year 90 percent declines in the early years of the shale boom that made some investors question the sector s long run viability  NEW PHILOSOPHY There are no 2016 figures yet  but oil executives expect the trend to continue this year and beyond  Scott Sheffield  chief executive of  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD   a top Permian producer  credited improved fracking techniques for helping stabilize production  which shareholders rewarded by lifting Pioneer s shares up about 9 percent over the past year   We re exposing more of the reservoir and breaking it up so we don t get as sharp a decline   Sheffield told a recent energy conference  Slower declines also reflect producers  more conservative approach to operating wells  In the early years of the hydraulic fracturing boom  high crude prices encouraged operators to boost initial production as much as possible  To do this  they would let wells flow fast by keeping pressure low on the ground s surface  About seven years ago  however  some shale operators in Louisiana found this ultimately hurt production later on by causing rock fractures to shut   Now  many operators maintain surface pressures higher  which limits initial flow rates and slows a well s decline rate   Conventional wisdom has shifted   said John Lee  a professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A M University  Sharma of the University of Texas said that while shale well decline rates remained far above a 10 percent first year decline a conventional well might experience  they marked a radical improvement compared with early years of hydraulic fracturing  Harold Hamm s  Continental Resources Inc   N CLR   for example  has told investors its new wells in Oklahoma s SCOOP region are now producing 40 percent more oil six months into their lives than as recently as last year   Today s production techniques use larger volumes of sand and pressurized fluids to frack more spots along longer well bores  to extract more oil from the wells   Graphic    Pioneer fracks its wells every 15 feet today compared to every 60 feet in 2013  It costs extra  500 000 per well to do so  but its wells produce two thirds more oil than just three years ago  boosting profitability  Pioneer said  To be sure  not all producers are seeing slower decline rates and the newer  more stable shale wells make up only a fraction of all producing U S  oil wells  so their impact on overall domestic output is for now limited

125795,347310,PXD,North American oil deals trickle back after Brexit shock,news,"By Mike Stone and Devika Krishna Kumar NEW YORK  Reuters    Acquisition hungry energy companies are back on the prowl  Dealmakers have recovered from the shock of Britain s  Brexit  vote last month to leave the European Union and have resumed buying oil and gas fields in choice locations in Canada and the United States  restocking their inventories on a bet that a two year slump in the price of oil has abated   Buyers are increasingly confident in a stable to slowly increasing oil price   as are their funding sources  whether private equity funds or public market investors   said Bobby Tudor  chief executive of Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co  an oil and gas investment bank  Oil prices  CLc1  have held steady at or above  45 a barrel for a majority of the last two months and touched a 2016 high above  51  ahead of the British referendum  Tudor said buyers were banking on it eventually settling at around  60 a barrel  giving them confidence about buying drilling acreage in some of the nation s shale heartlands  U S  oil and gas producer  Diamondback Energy Inc   O FANG  last week said it would spend  560 million buying leases on oil rich land in the Southern Delaware Basin  within the Permian Basin  the top U S  oilfield  where initial production results have been strong and costs are coming down  A day later  U S  energy company Laredo Petroleum Inc  N LPI  said it would spend  125 million buying acreage in the Midland Basin  also part of the Permian  These deals mark a resumption in buying after Brexit caused a temporary lull in acquisitions  Before the British referendum on June 23  buyers and sellers had grown comfortable with the idea that oil had rebounded from 12 year lows  That conviction helped to unclog the acquisition pipeline after a long dormant period in which deals were offered but failed to materialize  About  5 1 billion of U S  and Canadian properties traded hands in June  the largest dollar amount in more than a year according to PLS Inc  global M A database for such deals  Acreage deals create confidence and open the door to acquisitions of entire companies  so long as oil remains relatively steady  according to nearly a dozen dealmakers interviewed by Reuters  More acreage deals are in the works  including ones that involve large exploration and production  E P  companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corp  N APC  and Southwestern Energy Co  N SWN   according to people familiar with the matter  Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy  like Magnum Hunter Resources  or are going through the process  like  Ultra Petroleum Corp   UPLMQ PK   will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy  having eliminated much of their debt  Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now  a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions  Traditional E P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter  representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value  respectively  Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday  PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price   Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate  where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart  Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine week period of relatively low oil volatility  when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about  40 and  50 a barrel   Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out   according to bankers  That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about  60 per barrel  the bankers said  That forward price has now returned to its pre Brexit levels of about  54 a barrel  enabling deals once again  Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location  Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about  50 per barrel is profitable   The acreage most sought after is in Texas  Permian Basin and in Oklahoma s STACK area  Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and  Kingfisher   LON KGF  Counties   popular because of their easy to extract rock formations and relatively low break even prices   In June   Marathon Oil  Corp  N MRO  said it would spend about  888 million to acquire STACK acreage and  Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN  said it would sell Texas acreage to  Pioneer Natural Resources   N PXD  and an undisclosed buyer for  858 million  HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES  While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months  many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long term   Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U S  rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market  We think those concerns are unwarranted   ANZ said in a note   We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017   On Friday  U S  oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher   O R   Acreage inventory is being offered for sale  including 180 000 acres of West Virginia holdings currently belonging to Southwestern Energy Co  N SWN   people familiar with the deal said  Southwestern declined to comment   
Anadarko is marketing 86 000 net acres in East Texas  one person familiar with the deal said  adding that the deal could fetch as much as  1 billion  A spokesman for Anadarko declined to comment ",2016-07-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/north-american-oil-deals-trickle-back-after-brexit-shock-414883,414883
125796,347311,PXD,Jobless recovery looms for white collar U S  oil workers,news,"By Ernest Scheyder SPRING  Texas  Reuters    Elizabeth Huber lost her job inspecting oilfield pipes nearly 20 months ago and her prospects remain bleak even as oil executives cautiously plot production and budget increases  Despite crude trading 75 percent above its February lows and energy companies shifting focus from survival to recovery  white collar jobs in the sector remain as scarce as during the depths of the two year oil price rout   Like many laid off energy sector specialists  Huber  58  a metallurgical engineer  hopes this is just another cyclical downturn that will pass  Yet dozens of interviews with industry veterans  company executives and recruiters suggest this time might be different   Recruiters warn that many jobs may not return even when the tentative recovery gains momentum  Job seekers  especially those who have been through several ups and downs and are now nearing retirement age  fear they may get sidelined for good  Labor statistics seem to justify those fears  Over the past 25 years energy industry employment has closely tracked ups and downs in crude prices  This year  though  the sector continues to shed jobs even as prices rallied from around  26 per barrel to over  50 in June and have mostly held above  40 since   Graphic    To be sure  at this early stage doubts linger whether the recovery will hold after the slump that wiped out more than 200 000 jobs in the U S  oil industry and related sectors  The longer such uncertainty persists  the harder it will be for specialists like Huber to return   With severance and unemployment money long gone  Huber said she might have no choice but settle for any job that pays the bills   I can t afford to wait another year   she said at a recent meeting of Energy Job Search Team  a Houston networking event that draws hundreds each week   I m stretching every penny    EXPERTISE LOST For the industry  that could spell a loss of expertise that will be hard to replace if and when the next boom comes    You re seeing so many older people and experienced people be let go  The experienced people are out   said Carlos Pineda  59  a drilling completions engineer laid off from  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  in January 2016  He said this downturn definitely feels much worse than in 2008 and even in the 1980s  Even as executives of leading producers  such as EOG Resources Inc  N EOG  or  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD  have been talking about production and budget increases  that does not translate into more job offers   By the end of July  the U S  energy industry cut nearly 95 000 jobs compared with just under 70 000 a year earlier  according to staffing firm Challenger  Gray   Christmas Inc  One reason companies are wary of hiring again is the financial hangover after the shale drilling boom  It nearly doubled U S  oil output in five years  but left many producers with hefty debt payments that current oil prices barely cover  Tumbling oil prices also forced companies to get leaner quickly by making greater use of data and computer models  upgrading the techniques and streamlining operations   Drilling and fracking a new well used to take more than a month  in some cases it now takes half that time  or less  which means fewer drilling crews and specialists   There are many people who will never come back to the oil industry   said Gladney Darroh  head of energy recruiting firm Piper Morgan Associates  He said this latest downturn was the worst he had seen in 40 years   While many blue collar workers have already found jobs in construction and other industries  the future looks bleaker for petroleum engineers  geologists and other specialists whose skills do not transfer so easily   If you re a petroleum geologist  you don t become a loan executive   says Mike Kahn  a recruiter at Lucas Group in Houston  HANGING ON Tara Sinclair  senior economic fellow for global jobs site Indeed  says that while search patterns show blue collar energy workers starting to look for jobs elsewhere after six months  specialists tend to wait longer  They do not want years of training and experience to go to waste and many have the savings to be patient  The bad news is that whereas there has been an uptick in blue collar job postings in the past five months  Indeed figures show that listings of white collar energy jobs keep falling   Graphic    Many analysts expect companies to hold off with large scale hiring until oil prices eclipse  60 a barrel  despite industry concerns that the retiring baby boomer generation will leave a skills gap that may hurt future growth  Today  companies can raise production by re deploying idled rigs and completing unfinished wells  but recruiters warn later on they may struggle to find specialists they will need to find new deposits and further boost productivity   If in two years you need a reservoir engineer with experience  where are you going to find that person  It ll be very difficult   said Darroh  the recruiter  Oilfield services giant  Halliburton Co   N HAL   which laid off more than 20 000 workers in the past two years  is playing down such concerns  Mahesh Puducheri  global vice president of human resources  said attractive benefits and pay   often above  100 000 per year   act as strong incentives   Even though people would leave to go to another industry  the moment oil and gas pricing starts to pick up  we expect them to come back to our industry   he told Reuters   We ve never had issues attracting people back   Others are less confident and consider shortages of skilled labor as a long term risk  Yet their message is they have to live with that risk while market conditions remain uncertain

market power from the OPEC in the crude export race  This is because crude shipments through the Strait of Hormuz  touted as the most important global passage  situated between Iran and Oman might get disrupted by the escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran President Donald Trump has entreated nations with excessive dependence on Middle East oil to safeguard their ships or vessels while transporting crude through the unsafe strait Intensifying US Iran TensionsThe Global Hawk surveillance drone  manufactured by the United States  was shot down last week by the Revolutionary Guard of Iran  Tehran  the capital city  alleged that close to the Strait of Hormuz  the drone had breached the airspace of Iran  To make its voice stronger and clearer  Tehran even insisted that the drone s debris has been found within its inland waters However  Washington rubbished the accusation and added that the drone was intercepted over the international airspace  The drone attack followed the attack on two oil tankers that occurred on Jun 13 in the Gulf of Oman for which  the United States blamed Tehran Overall  tensions are probably bringing the United States and Iran on the verge of war

125807,347322,PXD,Here s Why You Should Retain Pioneer Natural  PXD  Stock Now,opinion,"Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   is well poised to grow on the back of strength in the Permian  a  super basin   However  lack of takeaway capacity remains a concern for now 
The Irving  TX based oil and gas exploration   production company   with a market cap of nearly  23 billion   has an expected earnings growth rate of 18 2  for the next five years  For second quarter 2019  its earnings per share are projected at  2 24  which indicates year over year growth of 58 9   It has witnessed five upward and nine downward estimate revisions in the past 60 days 
Let s delve deeper to find out why this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining in your portfolio at the moment 
A Look at the Positives
Pioneer Natural is a pure play Permian basin   the most prolific oil resource in the United States   producer  In the Midland basin  the company has the largest acreage position  with operations across 750 000 gross acres of land  In the prolific basin  Pioneer Natural has approximately more than 20 000 drilling sites that are likely to provide the company with decades of crude production 
Through the March quarter of 2019  Pioneer Natural s production level came in at the higher end of the projected range  The upstream energy player expects Permian production through 2019 in the band of 320 335 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBoE D   higher than 319 9 MBoE D a year ago 
The company plans to invest  2 8  3 1 billion through 2019 in upstream operations  Notably  Pioneer Natural expects to operate an average of 21 23 rigs in Permian this year  Resultantly  it is expected to generate nearly  4 billion of cash flow 
Price Performance
Clearly  investors are noticing the company s true potential  This is evident from Pioneer Natural s gain of 3 5  year to date against the 4 1  collective decline of the  it belongs to 

 
What s Deterring the Stock 
There are a few factors that are holding back the stock from reaching its true potential 
During 2018  the company s costs and expenses increased more than 58  from the prior year period  In particular  oil and gas production costs increased more than 44   and exploration and abandonments costs jumped 8   in turn hurting the bottom line  This increasing costs can affect its profit levels in the coming quarters 
Although Pioneer Natural has been strongly committed in returning cash to its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks  the company s dividend yield is significantly lower than the composite yield of the stocks belonging to the industry 
Infrastructural bottlenecks in the lucrative Permian shale play are concerning  While production in the Permian is soaring  takeaway capacity is not increasing in proportion  Owing to pipeline capacity constraints  Pioneer Natural and other producers have to sell products at a discounted rate  Though the company is entering into agreements to improve pricing exposure  the impact of the same is unlikely to be immediate 
To Sum Up
Despite riding on significant growth prospects  pipeline takeaway constraints and rising operating costs are concerns for the company  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth 
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked players in the energy space are Talos Energy Inc    NYSE TALO    Approach Resources Inc    NASDAQ AREX   and Earthstone Energy  Inc    NYSE ESTE    While Talos sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Approach Resources and Earthstone Energy hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Talos  sales growth is projected at 22 9  through 2019 
Approach Resources surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 12 7  
Earthstone Energy s sales growth is projected at 15  through 2019

125820,347335,PXD,At last  U S  shale firms see output falling  but is it enough ,news,"By Amrutha Gayathri and Swetha Gopinath  Reuters    In a ray of hope for oil bulls  leading U S  shale producers are at last predicting output declines this year   a long anticipated turning point for a market reeling from an epic supply surplus  The bad news is that   taken together   the declines they are disclosing to investors appear milder than some analysts have predicted  According to a Reuters analysis based on forecasts from 18 U S  shale oil oriented firms released over the past several weeks  from global independent Occidental Petroleum Corp  N OXY  to small  Denbury Resources Inc   N DNR   total oil and gas production would fall 5 6 percent this year  The same firms saw output grow by around a tenth last year  Even excluding the eight larger companies with operations outside the shale patch  where output is falling less quickly  production would decline by about 6 percent  the data show   Graphic    In contrast  the U S  Energy Information Administration is forecasting an 11 percent drop in national production outside of Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico  where output is expected to rise  In broad terms  the data confirm a long overdue reversal for U S  firms that have kept production rising throughout much of the oil price rout despite deep cuts in spending and drilling  On a monthly basis  nationwide oil output has been ebbing   though very slowly   since it reached a near 44 year high in April  The decline has quickened after oil tumbled to  30 a barrel for the first time in over a decade  with some companies leaving new wells idle rather than opening up the taps after drilling   Apache Corp   N APA  would  rather leave those barrels in the ground  and wait for prices to rebound than finish the fracking process  Chief Executive John Christmann said last week  Apache expects production  nearly two thirds of which is onshore in North America  to fall by 7 to 11 percent  Yet the overall declines may still appear unusually shallow given the scale of spending cuts  Many producers are still managing to coax ever more oil from each new well  tempering the reversal in production even with only 400 drilling rigs deployed nationwide  one quarter of the peak of 2014  according to Baker Hughes data  EOG Resources Inc  N EOG  expects to boost output from new wells in the first four months by 50 percent for each foot it drills  chairman and CEO Bill Thomas told analysts on Friday  EOG expects its oil production to dip by only about 7 6 percent this year   The resilience  of U S  shale  has been extraordinary  a tribute to technical expertise   Neil Atkinson  head of the International Energy Agency s benchmark Oil Market Report  said last week  The agency expects U S  production to rebound to record highs within just a few years   Anyone who believes the U S  revolution has stalled should think again   EFFICIENCIES RUNNING OUT Until this year  energy firms have been able to sustain output thanks to increased efficiencies and more targeted drilling  In December  shale powerhouse North Dakota pumped some 1 15 million barrels per day  barely 2 percent below its April 2015 peak  Now  the  precipitous  fall in rig count is beginning to outpace efficiency gains  said Brian Kessens  Portfolio Manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors  The anticipated declines show that there is a limit to how much companies can squeeze out of their oilfields without drilling and completing new wells  Whiting Petroleum  N WLL   the biggest producer in North Dakota  last week forecast its output would drop by over 18 percent  the most among the surveyed firms  as it set out to cut well completions and slash its capital budget by 80 percent  The only driller to anticipate an increase this year   Pioneer Natural Resources   N PXD   can do so largely because of its most extensive hedging among shale firms  Concho Resources  N CXO  and  Halcon  Resources Corp  N HK   which have also hedged substantial parts of their production  both see output slipping by less than 5 percent  All in all  output data so far and forecasts suggest this year s declines will be relatively modest  raising questions whether the retreat will be deep and long enough to support a sustained recovery in oil prices   Non OPEC supply needs to fall more broadly before the market gets rebalanced and prices recover in a durable way   Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said  STILL  AMAZING  While individual company forecasts offer the clearest view of supply from those closest to the oil wells  in sum they are a less than perfect gauge  The companies in the survey represent only a portion of U S  crude production  which reached a near record of 10 million bpd last year  and most offer no separate forecasts for crude oil  natural gas or other related liquids  Privately held companies  which do not report forecasts  may get hit harder  Projections from the half dozen larger firms in the group are bolstered by other large overseas or offshore non shale projects  which often produce crude for years without the need for new wells   Marathon Oil  Corp  N MRO   for instance  sees a 6 8 percent decline in overall output  but warned its big shale plays in the Bakken  Eagle Ford and SCOOP areas would drop by the  low teens   Occidental expects a 2 4 percent rise this year as overseas projects offset a  slight  decline from domestic wells  Yet its oil rich Permian Basin shale properties  source of one sixth of its output  are still expected to

125824,347339,PXD,With oil price near  50  resilient U S  shale producers eye new chapter,news,"By Ernest Scheyder and Terry Wade HOUSTON  Reuters    Two years into the worst oil price rout in a generation  large and mid sized U S  independent producers are surviving and eyeing growth again as oil nears  50 a barrel  confounding OPEC and Saudi Arabia with their resiliency  That shale giants  Hess Corp   N HES    Apache Corp   N APA  and more than 25 other companies have beaten back OPEC s attempt to sideline them would have been unthinkable just months ago  when oil plumbed  26 a barrel and collapses were feared   To regain market share  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in late 2014 pumped more oil despite growing global oversupply  It aimed to drive prices lower and force higher cost producers out of the market  with shale oil seen as especially vulnerable  The pain was acute  Industry revenue fell more than 30 percent in 2015 from the previous year  the U S  drilling rig count dropped by more than 70 percent from when oil was still above  100 per barrel  stock valuations plunged and scores of small producers filed for bankruptcy   But so far no U S  producer that pumps more than 100 000 barrels per day  bpd  has gone bankrupt  The survival of these big producers partly explains why overall U S  production has slipped only about 10 percent since peaking at 9 69 million bpd  Their agility   which required slashing costs in half while doubling down on improved techniques to squeeze more oil from each new well   is now allowing the industry to cautiously focus on growth again  But this time  U S  producers say they will stay focused on capital returns  having abandoned a culture of maximizing production regardless of costs  OPEC and Saudi Arabia  thought that there would be major capitulation and damage to U S  shale producers as a result of the deep downturn   said Les Csorba  a leadership consultant at Heidrick   Struggles who works with shale executives   But what happened was that it actually created a new paradigm among U S  producers to transform their businesses    Acquisition activity has picked up markedly in recent weeks  with  Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN  finding buyers for more than  2 billion in non core assets  The company is using part of that cash to boost its capital budget by  200 million    WPX Energy Inc   N WPX   which spent more on acquisitions last year than any U S  oil company  sold 45 million new shares earlier this month  planning to use the funds to drill new Texas wells   We re a leaner organization than we were before the price crash   said Rick Muncrief  WPX s chief executive   True  costs were slashed in the height of the price downturn when oil plumbed  26 per barrel in February and  there s a perception out there that if commodity prices go back up  you re going to lose those cost savings   Muncrief said   But  he stressed   that s simply not the case   Industry consensus holds that costs for oilfield services   fracking and the like   may rise in tandem with oil prices  though high tech advancements in sand  drilling and chemical technologies should stick around    Real progress for us has come on the cost side   said John Christmann  Apache s chief executive   We plan to maintain a methodical approach to the cycle with a focus on returns   U S  oil prices  CLc1  have recouped nearly half their losses from mid 2014 highs  almost doubling from the 13 year lows hit in February to reach over  51 in early June   A year ago prices hit similar levels before plunging  oil executives are hoping past is not prologue   People are not necessarily freaking out anymore   said Sam Xu  an investment banker with CohnReznick Capital Market Securities LLC   Instead of trying to keep their heads above the water  they re now trying to get back in the game    To be sure  some executives say a bit more is needed   at least  60 a barrel   to ramp up drilling and fracking operations across most U S  shale plays  That attitude has been reflected in oil producers  capital budgets  which are still billions below 2015 levels  Hess has long said it will add rigs in North Dakota when oil prices hit that mark  even though it is profitable in the state at  40   We need to see a period of stability in prices   Greg Hill  chief operating officer at Hess  said   We need to make sure it s not quicksand    Some oil companies aren t ready to even acknowledge the  50 milestone as relevant   We are head down and working and not ready to take any kind of victory lap   said Kristin Thomas  spokeswoman for  Continental Resources Inc   N CLR   North Dakota s second largest oil producer   Others are moving ahead in the Bakken  Eagle Ford and Permian  considered the cheapest and most prolific U S  shale oil fields   The Permian is set up for fairly explosive growth over the next several years   Scott Sheffield  CEO of  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD   said at a S P Global Platts conference  Pioneer this week said it would increase its rig fleet by 40 percent  Still  most producers are moving slowly

125832,347347,PXD,4 Of The Best Stocks To Buy For Superb Earnings Growth,opinion,Earnings growth enthralls all  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is simply because if a company doesn t make money  it won t survive for long  Consider a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production  and you have earnings This metric is also considered the most important variable in influencing the share price  But  expectations of earnings also play a significant role Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinion on factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move

125865,347380,PXD,Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this independent oil and gas company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Pioneer Natural Resources is 5 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 43 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 4  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Pioneer Natural Resources is 44 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 29 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12 2  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 5 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Pioneer Natural Resources have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 12 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Pioneer Natural Resources a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

125882,347397,PXD,Shell CEO says U S  should export oil to stabilize markets,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  policymakers should gradually lift the country s decades old ban on crude oil exports because allowing the shipments would make the global energy system and fuel prices more stable  the head of Royal Dutch Shell Plc  L RDSa  said on Tuesday 
 Policymakers here in the United States should embrace a truly liberalized  diverse and global energy market   Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden told an energy conference at Columbia University in New York 
U S  oil and natural gas exports  would reinforce the long term future of North American energy production   significantly improve the U S  balance of trade  and  help to make the global energy system much more stable   he said 
The United States has banned most crude exports since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s  But pressure on the Obama administration and on Congress to overturn the restriction has risen amid the domestic shale energy boom of the last several years  The United States is soon expected surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world s top oil producer 
The Commerce Department in March allowed two companies  Enterprise Product Partners  N EPD  and Pioneer Natural Resources  N PXD   to export an ultra light form of oil called condensate  The ruling became public in June 
But since then at least three applications for more condensate exports have been put on hold 
Meanwhile  Washington has approved several applications to export natural gas  with the first shipments expected next year 
In his first major public speech since becoming CEO of the energy firm in January  van Beurden said that gradually lifting the ban would be good for U S  fuel consumers because it would allow the country s oil production to keep growing and to keep oil flowing to global refiners  That should keep fuel prices from spiking  he said 
 I don t think it would be sensible to argue for an immediate opening overnight  but a systematic and gradual opening up of the export ban would be a sensible thing to do   he said 
Anglo Dutch Shell is the second largest Western energy company after Exxon Mobil Corp  N XOM  
Congress is not expected to overturn the crude export ban any time soon  Many lawmakers are concerned that by doing so they could be blamed if gasoline prices rose  even if a price move was caused by other factors 
The Obama administration could take other steps  though  such as allowing crude oil swaps  But there are no indications of that happening soon either 
 At this point our policy regarding crude oil exports remains as is   Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said on a teleconference with journalists on Tuesday 

Van Beurden said the U S  shale revolution was a long time in the making  Shale resources will also develop in Argentina  China and Algeria  but it will take time  he added

125883,347398,PXD,Exclusive  U S  agency gives quiet nod to light oil exports   sources,news,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The main U S  export authority is telling some oil companies that they should consider exporting a lightly processed form of crude oil called condensate without formal permission  according to people familiar with the discussions 
In conversations that may help clear the way for more overseas sales of U S  shale oil  the Commerce Department s Bureau of Industry and Security  BIS  has told companies seeking clarification on the legal status of so called  processed condensate  that self classification   whereby companies export their product without any formal authorization   could be a way forward  the people told Reuters 
An official familiar with the law said the agency s discussions did not represent a change in policy since self classification is allowed under U S  export controls and is a routine  common practice for the majority of exports 
Yet the message  though carefully couched as an informal suggestion  marks the first sign that the administration is becoming comfortable about allowing companies to work around the nation s four decades old ban on exporting untreated crude oil 
Last month  BHP Billiton Ltd  AX BHP  became the first company to announce it would export lightly processed ultra light U S  oil without explicit permission from the government  It said it was on firm legal footing because its product was similar to what the agency had already blessed for other companies in a landmark ruling earlier this year 
But until recently  the government s attitude toward the self classification for crude has been unclear  Officials have repeatedly declined to comment on what has become one of the year s most contentious and controversial energy policy topics  beyond saying that it is under review due to the surprising surge in U S  oil production 
 I would not characterize BIS s position necessarily as one of encouragement  but BIS has made clear that companies should not overlook the option of self classification   said Theodore Kassinger  a partner at law firm O Melveny   Myers  who had represented oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources  N PXD  in its dealings with the agency 
Two other sources told Reuters that the agency has said self classification may be an expedient option for companies confident their condensate has been adequately processed 
The agency did not respond to a request for comment 
PRIVATE PRECEDENT
In March  the agency told mid stream firm Enterprise Product Partners  N EPD  and Pioneer that condensate stabilized and processed through a distillation tower met the legal criteria for exports  Refined fuels and processed oil is not subject to the ban 
Because the earlier rulings were private  and the regulations themselves are unclear on how much  processing  is required  other firms have been hesitant to follow suit 
Several dozen energy companies have applied for similar export rulings  but the administration had put their clarification requests on indefinite hold 
Over the summer  those companies were asked to fill out a one page  nine question survey about their plans to export oil  including basic questions about the type of oil used for feedstock  the distillation process used and the characteristics of the output after processing 
Getting companies to self classify is likely preferable for the agency than responding case by case to pending requests  Jacob Dweck  a partner at the Sutherland law firm who has worked on behalf of Enterprise and other firms  told Reuters 
 The BIS obviously is aware that self classified exports of processed condensate are and will be taking place  They have no problem with such exports   said Dweck  who has become one of the most outspoken experts on the once obscure energy laws that ban crude exports 
It remains to be seen how many companies are now prepared to take the leap and begin exporting processed condensate  With global oil prices having halved since June  pushing U S  crude down to nearly  50 a barrel  exports are less alluring today than they were only a few months ago 
Even so  political pressure to share the U S  shale boom with the rest of the world had been building domestically and from foreign trade partners  such as South Korea  and is expected to become a major energy issue in the new year 

Texas Congressman Joe Barton earlier this month proposed a bill that would overturn the four decade old ban and said he would continue to press the issue in the new Republican led Congress in 2015

125884,347399,PXD,U S  opens door to oil exports after year of pressure,news,"By Timothy Gardner  WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Obama administration on Tuesday bowed to months of growing pressure over a 40 year old ban on exports of most domestic crude  taking two steps expected to unleash a wave of ultra light shale oil onto global markets   The Bureau of Industry and Security  or BIS  which regulates export controls  said it had granted permission to  some  companies to sell lightly treated condensate abroad  Condensate is a form of ultra light crude   Some two dozen energy companies had asked the agency for clarification on permissible exports earlier this year  but until Tuesday those requests had been put on indefinite hold   The BIS also released guidance in the form of frequently asked questions  or FAQs  to explain what kind of oil was generally allowed under the ban  the first effort by the administration to clarify an issue that has caused confusion and consternation in energy markets for more than a year   The two measures are clearest signs yet that the administration is ready to allow more of the booming U S  shale oil production to be sold overseas  where drillers have said it can fetch a premium of  10 a barrel or more   They follow a year of murky messages and widespread uncertainty over what is or is not allowed under a trade restriction that critics say is a relic of a bygone age  when oil was seen as scarce after the 1970s Arab oil embargo   A domestic drilling boom of the past six years has transformed the United States into an energy powerhouse  boosting U S  production by more than 50 percent and reversing decades of decline   Output of very light oil has been especially strong  leading to a glut that threatens to overwhelm domestic demand  The constraints helped fuel bumper profits for refiners such as Valero Energy Corp  N VLO  and PBF Energy Inc  N PBF   but angered drillers such as Hess Corp  N HES  that say they were selling at a discount   Jamie Webster  the senior director of oil markets at research firm IHS  said the FAQ  takes the leash off of  the U S  Department of  Commerce  and signals it may take additional action on crude exports after several months of inaction   While likely to draw broad support from many quarters  the measures also open the Obama administration to attack by environmentalists and Democrats who may see it encouraging more hydraulic fracking and as a sop to big oil companies   STEPS TO CLARIFY  How the measures will affect flows of condensate is uncertain  particularly given the dramatic slump in global oil markets  where prices have nearly halved since the summer   An administration official said that the oil market   not a  fairly arcane clarification  in guidelines   would ultimately determine how much oil is exported  That echoed the Obama administration s policy on exports of liquefied natural gas  or LNG  which are also now generally allowed   The steps on Tuesday were  certainly not designed to add or detract from what can be exported  We are trying to make the boundary line clearer   said the official   In its FAQ  which the agency has been working on for most of this year  the BIS confirmed or clarified a number of nuanced issues related to the rules  including     Confirmation that lease condensate processed through a distillation tower is considered a petroleum product  and therefore can be exported without constraint     Clarification of what constitutes  distillation  for export  including the fact that pressure reduction alone  and flash drums with so called heater treaters or separators  would not be sufficient to qualify oil for overseas sales     A reminder that most petroleum products may be  exported to most of the world without a license   a message seen by many analysts as blessing the process of self certification     And clarification that  a minimum amount of mixing  between exportable foreign crude and restricted domestic crude may be allowed  a note likely making it easier to ship Canadian crude through U S  pipelines and ports   FRUSTRATION BUILDING  Uncertainty about what kind of petroleum can be shipped abroad has frustrated oil market players since the BIS  an office of the Commerce Department  quietly gave permission in 2013 to a small company  Peaker Energy  to export minimally treated light oil called condensate   Last spring BIS gave permission to export treated condensate in private letters to two other companies  Pioneer Natural Resources Co  N PXD  and Enterprise Products Partners LP  N EPD    The private nature of the communications between the government and the three energy companies left a wide range of other drillers in the dark about investing in expensive infrastructure to process condensate   One company  Australia s BHP  AX BHP   said last month it would press ahead with exports without having received a formal approval from the BIS  but other energy companies have been reluctant to follow suit without further guidance   
Domestic pressure has also grown  Several lawmakers in the House of Representatives and Senate have said that unless energy companies can export oil to Asia and Europe  the drilling boom will eventually choke on its own output     Additional reporting by Jessica Resnick Ault and Jonathan Leff in New York  Editing by Jessica Resnick Ault  Bill Trott and Jeffrey Benkoe ",2014-12-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-opens-door-to-oil-exports-after-year-of-pressure-321752,321752

In early 2018  per a Financial Times article  400 earnings calls announced that  intends to return cash to shareholders  Total shareholder return via buybacks and dividends for the fourth quarter of 2018 reached a record  342 8 billion mark  reflecting 39 1  growth from the fourth quarter 2017 figure  read    
Buybacks Outdid Dividends 
Buybacks were given preference to dividends in    said Howard Silverblatt  senior index analyst  S P Dow Jones Indices 
S P Dow Jones Indices announced that the preliminary fourth quarter 2018 S P 500 stock buybacks   This topples the previous record of  203 8 billion created during the third quarter of 2018 and marks a 62 8  increase from the year ago period  There was an upheaval in the market in the fourth quarter  which dragged down stocks by an average 5 3   This in turn gave a boost to buybacks 
Meanwhile  the S P 500 dividends for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled  119 8 billion  also a record rise of 3 5  sequentially  S P 500 dividend growth almost came to a standstill  thanks to the waning benefits from Trump s tax cuts 
The S P 500 companies  post the approval of Trump s corporate tax cuts while the average growth rate declined to a poor 2  after a year  Last year  oil drillers Anadarko Petroleum Corp    NYSE APC   and Pioneer Natural Resources Co    NYSE PXD   hiked dividend as much as 400  and 300   respectively  This year  Home Depot   NYSE HD   ruled the list as of February with an increment of 32     read    
No wonder this trend made buyback ETFs like Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF   up 21 8   and SPDR S P 500 Buyback  NYSE SPYB  ETF   up 19 5   beat dividend growth ETFs  namely SPDR S P Dividend  NYSE SDY  ETF   TO SDY    up 13 2   and ProShares S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF   BO NOBL    up 13 5   this year 
What Lies Ahead 
Let s admit that the boost from tax cuts was a one time event  And the receding benefits will dent the buyback and dividend hike spree  For example  Information Technology buybacks already dropped 25 5  in fourth quarter 2018 from the third quarter level  
But then  the Fed is showing patience this year and the rates are likely to remain low  Dividend paying securities are major sources of consistent income and should do well amid subdued rates  In this regard  investors can bank on some high dividend ETFs like WBI Power Factor High Dividend ETF  andSPDR Portfolio S P 500 High Dividend ETF   which can safeguard one s portfolio even in turbulent times  Both funds yield more than 4  annually  read

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 15 billion  up 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10 15  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pioneer Natural Resources 
For Pioneer Natural Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pioneer Natural Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Pioneer Natural Resources would post earnings of  1 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 18  delivering a surprise of  15 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Pioneer Natural Resources doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-pioneer-natural-resources-pxd-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200412396,200412396

What s Next for Pioneer Natural Resources 
While Pioneer Natural Resources has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Pioneer Natural Resources was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

125912,347427,PXD,Energy Analysts Split Over Significance Of New US Oil Exports,news,"By    Two companies have obtained permission to sell ultralight oil overseas as soon as August outside of a decades long ban on U S  crude exports  and energy analysts couldn t disagree more over the significance of the new exports 
After the news broke Tuesday  oil refiner stocks fell 6 to 10 percent  and oil producer stocks rose 2 to 3 percent  but  investors jumped the gun   according to Fadel Gheit  an oil and gas analyst for Oppenheimer 
 The market exaggerated the impact   he said Thursday   It s much ado about nothing  
Andrew Weissman  an energy market analyst and attorney at Haynes and Boone  called the ruling  very  very significant   saying the stock market reacted fairly strongly and appropriately 
In a private ruling earlier this year  the Obama administration permitted Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD  and Enterprise Products Partners LP  NYSE EPD  to ship a variety of ultralight oil known as condensate to foreign buyers  the Wall Street Journal first reported Tuesday 
Condensate can flow as a frothy liquid at normal temperatures and a gas underground  causing disagreement within the industry on its definition  Its flammable and volatile properties make it difficult to transport  highlighted by recent fiery train derailments 
The ban on oil exports applies only to unprocessed crude  not gasoline  diesel and other petroleum products  but the permits toe the limits of the ban because the condensate to be exported needs only minimal processing  Permits are not needed to export petroleum products  but the private ruling gives the companies legal protection 

 It does not constitute a loosening of the ban on crude oil exports   Benjamin Salisbury  senior energy policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets   Co  told clients in a research note Tuesday   Processing oil  including condensate  through a distillation tower has been the defining feature of a product allowable for export for years under Department of Commerce rules  
However  the move could calm oil producers  fears of an oversupply of condensate in the U S  that would cause oil prices to drop  he added 
 From a legal standpoint  from what s been disclosed  the ruling really opens the door to anyone in the U S  who wants to export condensate and has the equipment to process it   Weissman said  He believes that by the end of the year  the industry may export as much as 1 million barrels a day of condensate 
Gheit said he talked to 15 oil companies this week  and  not one said they were interested in exporting condensate  
 What  condensate  they have  they have already found a home for   he said  adding that many refineries are opting not to invest in equipment to process the ultralight oil because they think the shale boom won t last  Some refineries have  however  been investing in what are called condensate splitters to help them process the ultralight crude  and they will lose the benefit of cheaper U S  crude as more is shipped overseas  
Whether or not oil and gas companies choose to export condensate will have  some major repercussions for natural gas prices   Weissman said  
Already  drillers tend to opt for liquids over gas because producing oil is often more profitable with relatively low natural gas prices  and the ability to export condensate could encourage companies to choose oil over gas until natural gas prices rise ",2014-06-26,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/energy-analysts-split-over-significance-of-new-us-oil-exports-291764,291764
125913,347428,PXD,Oil Traders Likely To Avoid Short Side Over Venezuela Uncertainty ,opinion,"Energy Report
Oil prices are pricing in optimism that there will be a path to ending the U S    China trade dispute  providing a major kick to the global economy  The economy around the globe has been sputtering as companies tried to take cover or take advantage of the dispute  As it seems now that we see some light at the end of the tunnel  the markets are looking past weak data to the economic boost that we may get with a deal  For oil  that  of course  is very bullish as we will see oil demand expectations rise in a world where OPEC is cutting production and supplies are at risk in Venezuela 
The BBC is reporting that Venezuela s President Nicol s Maduro has closed the border with Brazil amid a row over humanitarian aid  The embattled leader said he could also shut the key border with Colombia to stop the opposition from bringing in relief  He denies any crisis and calls the aid delivery plans the U S  orchestrated a show  His ally  Russia  has also accused the U S  of trying to arm Venezuela s opposition  Rival concerts will be held on both sides of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia on Friday  On the Colombian side  an event will be held to raise money for Venezuela  At the same time  Mr  Maduro s government will hold its own concert  just 300m  980ft  away  Opposition leader Juan Guaid  and his allies hope to collect the food and medicine being gathered in neighboring Brazil and Colombia on Saturday  in defiance of President Maduro  Head of the National Assembly  Mr  Guaid  declared himself interim leader during anti government protests last month and is recognized by dozens of countries  including the U S  and most Latin American nations 
For oil  this showdown will keep oil traders away from the short side as there is fear that this conflict could escalate  The longer term impact of the loss of Venezuelan oil will be felt in oil products if this dispute continues  Depending on how the events play out we could see oil sharply higher or lower on Sunday night  Still  with China talks going well the trade Friday is to be long 
U S  record production is at a record high so one might assume that shale producers would be raking in the cash  Well  you would be thinking incorrectly  The Wall Street Journal reported that Pioneer Resources  who the Wall Street Journal says is one of the biggest oil and gas producers in the hottest U S  shale drilling region  the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico  with a market capitalization of about  24 billion  according to FactSet  is seeing its CEO retire  It might be because  Pioneer declared fourth quarter profits of  324 million  That was a 51  decline from the same period a year earlier  They also had to spend about 20  more in capital than analysts expected  So  in other words the company had to spend more and drill more to make a lot less  The Stock fell about 7   according to the Journal  and it may have been the reason CEO Timothy Dove decided to retire early 
It s not just Pioneer  Halcon Resources an independent energy company focused on the acquisition  production  exploration and development of liquids rich assets in the Delaware Basin  has also announced a management shakeup They announced a  10 million estimated reduction in annual overhead costs as part of renewed focus on maximizing shareholder value through operational improvement  In other words  despite optimistic talk about U S  shale output they are cutting back ",2019-02-24,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-200391853,200391853

125917,347432,PXD,Why Energy Investors Should Buy ProPetro  PUMP  Right Now,opinion,ProPetro Holding Corp    NYSE PUMP   looks compelling at the moment  Given the company s strong fundamentals and positive estimate revisions  it seems like this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio Midland  TX based ProPetro is an oilfield services provider  operating primarily in the prolific Permian Basin  spanning across West Texas and New Mexico  The company offers a wide spectrum of specialized and complementary services  and equipment for exploration and production of oil and natural gas  Notably  ProPetro currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which means the company is poised to outperform the market Let s delve deeper to analyse the factors that make this oilfield service provider an attractive investment option at the moment Deriving Profit From Permian BasinProPetro s hydraulic fracturing horsepower is deployed in the Permian Basin  which is widely regarded as the dominant domestic growth area for onshore oil output  The surge in volumes from the  super  basin should ensure continued expansion in exploration and production spending in the region  Notably  the basin is currently producing just above 4 million barrels daily  BPD   almost double than that of two years ago  and is expected to churn out another 1 million BPD by early 2020  ProPetro  through its healthy leverage to the Permian Basin  is likely to benefit from this multi year upcycle by providing hydraulic fracturing and other well completion services to the producing firms Stable Revenue GeneratorThe company s  400 million purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources  Permian pressure pumping assets led to a 56  increase in ProPetro s current base to 1 415 000 horsepower across 28 hydraulic fracturing fleets  The acquisition  which transformed ProPetro into a Permian focused pressure pumping powerhouse  includes a 10 year strategic service agreement encompassing approximately 30  of its total fleet  With Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD  being one of the largest Permian operators still expanding in the shale play  this long term contract is expected to provide a stable revenue base for ProPetro The company s strong relationships with high quality customers provide revenue visibility and business certainty  Its clients   mostly well capitalized  blue chip exploration and production companies with long term production growth plans in the Permian Basin   are likely to be less susceptible to commodity price fluctuations  This should ensure multi year revenue stability for ProPetro Decreasing Costs Lead to Higher ProfitsProPetro s adjusted EBITDA grew more than 180  year over year to  388 5 million in 2018  Apart from strong utilization  the surge in profitability was driven by cost efficiencies from regional sand usage  In the fourth quarter  the company sourced around 71  of the sand locally compared with 57  in the third quarter and 35  in the second quarter  The shift to cheaper regional sand from the more costly Northern White variety boosted ProPetro s supply chain economics by eliminating rail costs  lowering downtime and improving availability  With the usage of local sand likely to rise with more supplies coming online in Texas  the company should be able to sustain its robust EBITDA performance Balance Sheet Strength ProPetro boasts a strong balance sheet with ample cash reserves and a relatively low debt load  As of year end 2018  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  132 7 million and a long term debt of  70 million  with a net cash position of around  63 million  Importantly  ProPetro s debt to capitalization ratio of just a little above 8  is lower than the  average of 29 3   thereby providing it with enough financial flexibility to tap strategic growth opportunities  The company also has  125 million available under the revolving credit facility  which further strengthens its liquidity position   Undervalued StockIn terms of EV EBITDA ratio   which is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas related companies because energy firms have a large amount of debt and EV  Enterprise Value  including debt for valuing company or industry   ProPetro seems undervalued  The company currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 5 7  which is way below the broader industry s 9 1  as shown in the figure below   Bottom Line ProspectsOver the past 60 days  15 analysts have upwardly revised earnings estimates for first quarter 2019  while only one has decreased the same for ProPetro  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has been revised upward from 48 cents per share to 58 cents  which is 38 1  higher than the year ago figure of 42 cents  In full year 2019  its bottom line is expected to increase 19 5  from a year ago to  2 39 per share Wrapping UpA clear picture can be derived from the above mentioned growth drivers  which differentiate ProPetro from peers  Its strong Permian presence  stable revenue generating abilities and cost reduction efforts will enable it to achieve top and bottom line improvements  while strong balance sheet will provide the company with

125940,347455,PXD,Politics  U S  Shale Drove 2018 Oil Prices  That Won t Change In Early 2019,opinion,"Without doubt  the biggest story for oil during 2018 was its price volatility  The commodity is nearly 30  lower now than where it was last year 
WTI started 2018 trading at close to  60 per barrel  it s now hovering in the  44  47 per barrel range  Brent began the year at  66 65 and closed on Wednesday at nearly  54 dollars per barrel 

During the first four months of 2018  oil markets were volatile but the commodity still climbed steadily higher  This was helped by the OPEC and non OPEC cooperative agreement to reduce oil production 
With several outside organizations  among them S P Global Platts  whose production numbers are often quoted in these columns  and regular meetings of OPEC s Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee  JMMC  it was determined that most countries did indeed adhere to their production allocations  Still  Iraq and Kazakhstan were notable consistent overproducers 
A second factor driving prices higher during this period  several major producing countries experienced involuntary declines in output  In particular  former powerhouse producer Venezuela  whose production dipped to 1 41 million barrels per day in April  and Angola  which produced only 1 53 million barrels per day during the same period  Production in Libya and Gabon also declined at the same time 
Surprise Headwinds Pressure Prices
The next eight months of 2018  however  made the early part of the year look relaxed  even calm  A series of unexpected headwinds combined to ultimately pressure prices lower 
At the beginning of May  the Trump administration announced it would issue new sanctions against the Iranian oil industry  to take effect in early November  The decision itself wasn t especially surprising  but the market reaction was telling  Although WTI hit  72 per barrel in mid May  by June those gains were erased 

The real impact of the Trump administration s new sanctions policy became apparent from June  through July and August  Initially  analysts assumed the Trump administration would simply reinstate the Obama era sanctions on Iran s oil industry and implement them the same way 
Those sanctions included significant exemptions for Asian importers of Iranian oil that reduced their purchases of Iranian crude  At the time  these countries were also allowed to import as much condensate as they wanted  as long as their crude oil purchases declined 
However  the Trump administration came out with strong rhetoric indicating that it would not issue exemptions and that it expected that purchasers of Iranian oil would cut their imports to zero by the November 5 implementation date 
As well  the U S  shale industry helped drive the volatility  At the OPEC International Seminar  held on June 20  Scott Sheffield  the CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD  dropped a bombshell  He told attendees that a lack of pipelines and other infrastructure would curb U S  oil production in West Texas and New Mexico  He noted that OPEC would need to put more oil on the market or oil prices would climb above  80 per barrel and that within the next 3 or 4 months producers would be forced to shut wells 
As a result  from June 20 to July 5  oil prices climbed to numbers that even raised concern among politicians  The price of gasoline jumped  just in time to hit consumers during the height of the summer travel season in the U S 
WTI gained  10  rising to  74 per barrel  initiating a barrage of public and private pressure from President Trump aimed at OPEC  and particularly Saudi Arabia  to increase oil production so that when the U S  sanctions on Iran went into effect  oil prices wouldn t spike into the triple digits  OPEC had already indicated that due to the involuntary production cuts some producers were suffering 
The cartel and associates announced they would no longer adhere to individual quotas  Instead  the group was determined that producers with spare capacity could overproduce their quotas to compensate for declines elsewhere 
Nonetheless  by mid September analysts were forecasting  100 oil  Traders bought that prediction even though there were signs that growing oil supplies and slowing demand growth would not support that high a price  Despite reports from the EIA during the month that the U S  had likely surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world s largest oil producer  prices continued to climb 
WTI hit a record high of almost  77 per barrel in early October  Throughout the month  Saudi Arabia quietly increased production  then increased production yet further  but this time in November  with greater fanfare  reaching a high of 11 02M barrels per day  according to Platts  
The effort paid off  Oil prices declined throughout October as more oil from Saudi Arabia  Russia and the UAE hit the market and it became clear that the feared infrastructure crunch in the Permian was not nearly as bad as had been forecast  Shale producers took advantage of higher prices  moved rigs to areas with more pipelines and used other means to transport their oil out of the Permian instead of curbing production 
The decision by EPIC Midstream Holdings to convert the EPIC pipeline to carry crude oil use also helped alleviate the infrastructure crunch  keeping production growth strong 
But at the beginning of November  the Trump administration surprised markets  by announcing it would not  in fact  require importers of Iranian oil to cut their purchases to zero by November 5  Rather  it would be issuing exemptions to certain regional importers 
Though the amount of Iranian oil that could legally remain on the market was less than what was allowed during the Obama era sanctions  the exemptions were significant  Prices dropped 
The freefall continued throughout November and December  Indeed  during the past month markets saw several days with slides of as much as 6  or 8  in a single day  OPE  during a meeting in early December  predictably decided to cut production by 1 2 million barrels per day 
Markets  however weren t satisfied  considering the reduction not nearly enough  U S  oil output continues to grow even as demand growth is expected to slow 
This fact  along with fears of a recession  have brought oil prices down to their lowest point all year  In the waning days of 2018  oil appears to be recouping some of its losses  but these gains  8  for Brent and 10  for WTI on December 26  do not necessarily indicate a trend 
 100 Oil No Longer A Possibility
Just a few months ago  many believed we would see oil selling for  100 per barrel before year end  Heading into the first few months of 2019  the market could be lucky if Brent remains above  50 per barrel  WTI may stay squarely in the  40s 
Earlier this month  I described 3 key developments I believe will affect oil markets in 2019  Major catalysts are likely to be OPEC and the Iran sanctions 
OPEC will meet in April and the U S  will review and reconsider its sanctions waivers shortly thereafter  However  if it looks like WTI won t break the  50 mark in January  traders should also keep an eye on shale oil companies  rig counts and the weekly production statistics  These low prices  combined with tighter lending practices from Wall Street  could force some companies to slow their growth during first half of 2019 ",2018-12-27,"Ellen R.

125941,347456,PXD,Why Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this independent oil and gas company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 7 02   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Pioneer Natural Resources came out with earnings of  2 07 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 69 per share  representing a surprise of 22 49   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 54 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 41 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 44  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Pioneer Natural Resources  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Pioneer Natural Resources has an Earnings ESP of  0 36  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 13  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pioneer-natural-resources-pxd-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200382098,200382098
125942,347457,PXD,Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  41  
Revenues are expected to be  2 34 billion  up 53 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 16 89  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pioneer Natural Resources 
For Pioneer Natural Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pioneer Natural Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Pioneer Natural Resources would post earnings of  1 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 07  delivering a surprise of  22 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

125971,347486,PXD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  W T Offshore  Whiting  Concho And Denbury,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  December 6  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  W T Offshore  Inc    NYSE WTI    Whiting Petroleum Corporation   NYSE WLL    Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO   and Denbury Resources Inc    NYSE DNR   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Oil s Steepest Monthly Fall in a Decade  OPEC to the Rescue Will oil continue to be in bear territory  The consensus from the 175th OPEC meet in Vienna  Austria  will probably answer this   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  is gearing up to meet its allies  led by Russia  on Thursday and Friday  Many analysts expect major producers to cut oil output as the pricing scenario of the commodity is weak  thanks to swelling global supplies and soft demand outlook on fears of economic slowdown  Crude Plunges 22  in NovemberWest Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude plummeted almost 22  through November  marking the steepest monthly decline since October 2008 Surprisingly  this record monthly fall came after the commodity traded at  76 40 per barrel in October  the highest price since November 2014  The sudden drop in prices was upsetting for investors who expected black gold to reach  100 a barrel OPEC s Likely Production Cut With crude in the bear territory  there is a need for oil production cut  said current president of the cartel   Suhail al Mazroui  In fact  the energy minister of U A E showed confidence that the key producers of oil will agree on a production cut Following a meeting with Mohammed Bin Salman   the crown prince of Saudi Arabia   Russian president Vladimir Putin commented on Saturday about his decisions to extend efforts to address the imbalance in the oil market through 2019  However  none of the parties commented on the volume to be cut Media reports claimed that the technical advisers of OPEC made a recommendation to cut daily production by 1 3 million barrels through next year  However  sources added that Russia is willing to cut smaller volumes Which Energy Firms Will Benefit Most of the shale plays in the domestic market have the break even oil price at significantly below  50  per a presentation by Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD   The break even crude price for several domestic resources   like Permian  Eagle Ford and Bakken   is even below  30  The break even oil price for deepwater drilling has also dramatically decreased to  30 a barrel  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  RDS A  told Financial Times Moreover  energy research and consulting group Wood Mackenzie s analysis revealed that derivatives contracts on average protected 45  of the U S  drillers    only those firms employing derivative contracts   2018 liquid production and 25  of next year s output  The consulting firm added that the firms have set their hedging in such a way that they will benefit when crude drops below  56 per barrel  Hence  the derivative contracts are insulating the companies as oil hovers around  50 Given the hedging program and low break even oil price of key U S  shale and deepwater resources  upstream energy players are immune  to some extent  if the consensus in the Vienna meeting goes against production cut  Needless to say  vote in favor of production cut   that is most likely   will be a boon for producers as their fate is directly related to oil price  Oil Stocks in FocusWith the aforesaid positives  we have selected four stocks that have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  or 3  Hold  You can

126004,347519,PXD,MTDR Vs  PXD  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States stocks have likely encountered both Matador Resources  MTDR  and Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Matador Resources and Pioneer Natural Resources are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
MTDR currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 93  while PXD has a forward P E of 22 08  We also note that MTDR has a PEG ratio of 0 64  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  PXD currently has a PEG ratio of 1 78 
Another notable valuation metric for MTDR is its P B ratio of 1 67  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PXD has a P B of 2 21

On the news front  energy biggies BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   and EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   came up with stronger than expected earnings reports  driven by higher oil prices and production  while refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   agreed to acquire rival Andeavor   NYSE ANDV   for more than  23 billion

The U S  oil benchmark settled at three year highs on the possibility of United States re imposing sanctions on Iran and sharp declines in output from Venezuela 
Of late  crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America s exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12  The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC s third largest oil producer s energy industry and reduce global supply 
Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters  With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse  oil output has dwindled by almost 50  since the early 2000s  Venezuela currently churns out just around 1 5 million barrels per day  much lower that its pledge per the OPEC led supply cuts

126025,347540,PXD,U S  Retains World s Top Petroleum Producer Status For 2017,opinion,Riding on the shale revolution yet again  the United States topped the global energy production charts in 2017 by churning out more than 15 million barrels per day  MMBbl d   Retaining its status as the world s No  1 producer of petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons for the sixth straight year  the United States has beaten Saudi Arabia and Russia As crude prices surged last year to above break even levels  American drillers extracted record amounts of oil  especially from the less expensive shale plays even as Russia and Saudi Arabia withheld supplies to revive the commodity It must be mentioned that the United States became the world s largest natural gas operator back in 2009 when it went past Russia  while it jumped to the top of the petroleum hydrocarbons leaderboard in 2013 ahead of Saudi Arabia  As far as overall production is concerned  the United States has been the world s top producer since 2012 The Shale RevolutionWith the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking    a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale production is now booming in the United States  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract oil gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  oil and natural gas are now available in abundance U S  Production Rises in 2017 to Maintain No  1 PositionAccording to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   which provides official energy statistics from the U S   domestic liquids supply increased by 745 000 barrels a day last year as oil prices gained 21  to around  65 a barrel In contrast  both Saudi Arabia and Russia saw their petroleum output decrease in 2017 as part of a broader alliance   forged in late 2016   to limit production  The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut Meanwhile  U S  natural gas production turned around from previous year s loss but rose by a meagre 1  in 2017  The tepid growth was mainly on account of lower prices prevailing in the early part of the year  relatively warmer winter weather  compared with 2016  and fall in power generation demand On the other hand  Russia and Saudi churned out significantly higher natural gas in 2017   growing at 8  and 6  year over year  respectively Overall  U S  production of petroleum liquids and natural gas reached an estimated 15 60 MMBbl d in 2017 What s Ahead The EIA further added that U S  petroleum production is forecast to average 17 58 MMBbl d in 2018 and 19 14 MMBbl d next year  continuing the positive trend from 2017  Volume from U S  oil fields  inclusive of shale  has risen 27  since mid 2016 to more than 10 7 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  In early February  oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter  In fact  domestic volumes are now breathing down the neck of top producer Russia  which pumps around 11 million barrels per day The EIA also predicts natural gas production to set a new record in 2018  churning out 80 5 billion cubic feet on a daily basis Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityNow at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work  Throughout the downturn  producers  in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas  worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50  60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand

126028,347543,PXD,The Real Reasons Oil Prices Are Soaring ,opinion,"Oil prices are surging  But the reasons have less to do with OPEC s oil production increase  announced last Friday  and more to do with not as prominent catalysts 

Though oil prices moved decisively higher after OPEC s announcement at the end of last week  with Brent crude jumping about 3  and the U S  benchmark WTI gaining more than 4  on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  decision  the additional gains are being fueled by two specific drivers 

OPEC s original announcement was vague and deceptive  On Friday the cartel made it appear as though the production increase would be less than the market had expected  OPEC may have been forced to present such an image on Friday in order to satisfy Iran s political considerations 
A key supplier of Canadian crude oil to the United States  Syncrude  announced on Friday that crude oil exports of around 300 000 bpd to the U S  would be halted for the remainder of June as well as for all of July  at least  The company suffered a power outage last week and is working to fix the faulty transformer at its Alberta facility 

A closer examination of the timeline for the OPEC announcement shows that the much focused on Friday release only broadcast an incomplete version of the agreement  The following day  representatives from Russia  Kazakhstan  Azerbaijan  Oman and other countries joined OPEC to negotiate a larger agreement on production quotas for the remainder of 2018  It was actually only then decided that the group would increase oil production  Although the group is technically targeting an increase of 1 million bpd  many analysts expect the increase will only be about 600 000 bpd  because some countries  such as Venezuela and Angola  are currently incapable of increasing beyond their current production numbers 
Indeed  production numbers from Venezuela are expected to continue dropping  Short term production from OPEC member Libya is also in jeopardy as fires last week destroyed a number of Libya s export storage tanks and reduced its export capacity by 450 000 barrels 
Russia and OPEC made clear at the Saturday meeting that countries with spare capacity would be tasked with increasing production to replace barrels lost from Venezuela and other countries  The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee  JMMC  will allocate those increases to Saudi Arabia  Russia  the UAE  Kuwait and others as necessary 
Even though Saudi oil minister Khalid al Falih said that the group would be careful not to increase too quickly and flood the market  Saudi Arabia has already announced that it will produce 10 8 million bpd in June  That would be a record amount of production for Saudi Arabia 
Aramco  the Saudi national oil company  recently revealed that it plans to produce 11 million bpd in July  Saudi Aramco s CEO Amin Nasser clarified that Aramco  which produced 10 01 million bpd in May  can generate about 12 million bpd  if needed   Keep in mind that Saudi Arabia s domestic oil consumption always spikes in the summer  
Both Brent and WTI dropped when futures markets opened Sunday night  However  because of the Syncrude outage  WTI fell much less sharply than Brent  This has tightened the spread between Brent and WTI  which had grown as much as  10 per barrel earlier in the month 
The Syncrude outage means that the price of the Canadian benchmark  West Canadian Select  WCS   should rise during the coming weeks  It had been selling at a significant discount 
We should also expect to see reports that oil production in the Permian  in Texas  is slowing  as some companies cut production due to transportation bottlenecks  Pioneer Resources  NYSE PXD  announced that it plans to shut wells in the Permian within the next 4 months  Other companies are likely to follow  because there is a paucity of pipeline capacity  The overall growth forecast for shale oil producing regions of the U S  is still strong  but some companies will struggle in the short term as they face transportation shortages 
Meanwhile  traders should pay attention to the developing situation with Iran  On Tuesday  the Trump administration pushed big buyers of Iranian crude  primarily Asian countries  to halt all purchases of Iranian crude oil before sanctions come into full effect in November 
This is significantly harsher than U S  policy in 2012  which granted waivers to Asian importers of Iranian crude  The 2012 policy allowed Asian markets to continue importing Iranian crude as long as they progressively reduced the amount they imported  The current policy could keep crude oil prices elevated this summer even as Saudi Arabia  Russia and other producers ramp up production ",2018-06-27,"Ellen R.

126029,347544,PXD,Top U S  Shale Oil Fields Decline Rate Reaches New Record   Half Million Barrels,opinion,"While the US reached a new record of 11 million barrels of oil production per day last week  the top five shale oil fields also suffered the highest monthly decline rate ever  This is bad news for the US shale industry as it must produce more and more oil each month  to keep oil production from falling 
According to the newest EIA Drilling Productivity Report  the top five US Shale Oil fields monthly oil decline rate is set to surpass a half million barrels per day in August   Thus  the companies will have to produce at last 500 000 barrels of new oil next month just to keep production flat 
Here are the individual shale oil field charts from the EIA s July Drilling Productivity Report 

The figures that are shown above the UP arrow denote the forecast new production added next month while the figures above the DOWN arrow provide the monthly legacy decline rate  For example  the chart on the bottom right hand side is for the Permian Region  The EIA forecasts that the Permian will add 296 000 barrels per day  bpd  of new shale oil production in August  while the existing wells in the field will decline by 223 000 bpd 
If we add up these top five shale oil fields monthly decline rate for August will be 503 000 bpd  Thus  the shale oil companies must produce at least 503 000 bpd of new oil supply next month just to keep production from falling  And  we must remember  this decline rate will continue to increase as shale oil production rises 
We can see this in the following chart below  Again  according to the EIA s figures  the top five US shale oil fields monthly legacy decline rate increased from 398 000 bpd in January to 503 000 bpd for August 

In just the first seven months of 2018  the total monthly decline rate from these top shale fields increased by 26   These massive decline rates are the very reason the shale oil and gas companies are struggling to make money  A perfect example of this is Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD   Pioneer is the largest shale oil producer in the Permian  According to Pioneer s Q1 2018 Report 

Producing 260 thousand barrels oil equivalent per day  MBOEPD  in the Permian Basin  an increase of 9 MBOEPD  or 3   compared to the fourth quarter of 2017  first quarter Permian Basin production was at the top end of Pioneer s production guidance range of 252 MBOEPD to 260 MBOEPD  as previously announced  freezing temperatures in early January resulted in production losses of approximately 6 MBOEPD  Permian Basin oil production increased to 170 thousand barrels of oil per day  MBOPD   63 horizontal wells were placed on production 

Pioneer spent  818 million on capital expenditures  CapEx  for additions to oil and gas properties  drilling and completion costs  during Q1 2018  brought on 63 horizontal wells in the Permian  and only added 9 000 barrels per day of oil equivalent over the previous quarter  So  how much Free Cash Flow did Pioneer make with oil prices at the highest level in almost four years  Well  you re not going to believe me   so here is Pioneer s Cash Flow Statement below 

Pioneer reported  554 million in cash from operations and spent  818 million drilling and completing oil wells in the Permian and a few other locations  Thus  Pioneer s Free Cash Flow was a negative  264 million  However  Pioneer spent an additional  51 million for additions to other assets and other property and equipment shown right below the RED highlighted line for a total of  869 million in total CapEx spending  Total net free cash flow for Pioneer is   315 million if we include the additional  51 million 
Therefore  the largest shale oil producer in the Permian spent  264 million more than they made from operations drilling 63 new wells in the Permian and only added a net 9 000 barrels per day of oil equivalent  Now  how economical is that 
How long can this insanity go on 
If we look at the Free Cash Flow for some of the top shale energy companies in Q1 2018  here is the result 

Of the ten shale companies in the chart above  in order  Continental Resources Inc  NYSE CLR   EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG   Whiting Petroleum Corporation  NYSE WLL   Concho Resources Inc  NYSE CXO   Marathon Oil Corporation  NYSE MRO   Oasis Petroleum Inc  NYSE OAS   Occidental Petroleum Corporation  NYSE OXY   Hess Corporation  NYSE HES   Apache  NYSE APA  and Pioneer   only three enjoyed positive free cash flow  while seven suffered negative free cash flow losses  The net result of the group was a negative  455 million in free cash flow  
Even with higher oil prices  the US shale energy companies are still struggling to make money 
So  the question remains  What happens to these shale oil companies when the oil price falls back towards  30 when the stock market drops by 50   over the next few years   And how is the US Shale Energy Industry going to pay back the  250  billion in debt

126045,347560,PXD,Eni  E  May Offload Mexican Oilfield Stake To Drive Growth,opinion,"Eni SpA   NYSE E   is planning to offload part of its stake in Mexican oilfield to cash in on other opportunities  said Bloomberg 
The integrated energy player is reportedly discussing the sale of 20  to 35  stake in the Campeche Bay oil prospect with prospective buyers  including Qatar Petroleum  Eni presently has full ownership in the massive crude discovery and anticipates to produce first oil by early next year 
The stake divestment plan is in line with the company s dual exploration model  The model reflects Eni s intention to gain liquid assets from a potential prospect much before the field starts production  This will also help the company return cash to shareholders through dividend payments  Over the last four years  the dual exploration model has fetched Eni  9 billion  per Bloomberg 
Eni won rights to conduct operations in the two billion barrels of oil prospect in 2015  when Mexico conducted its second crude auction  The sale of the minority oilfield stake reflects the companies  participation in active farm out agreement in Mexico  The country has put an end to state monopoly in its upstream operations by opening up the business for other players during 2013 
Headquartered in Rome  Italy  Eni has rallied 12 8  over the past year  outperforming the  8  gain 

Eni carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A few better ranked players in the energy space are W T Offshore  Inc    NYSE WTI    Pioneer Natural Resources Co    NYSE PXD   and Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO    All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

126046,347561,PXD,Here s Why You Should Scoop Up W T Offshore Stock Right Now,opinion,"On Apr 6  W T Offshore  Inc    NYSE WTI   was raised to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Why the Upgrade 
The share price of W T Offshore has skyrocketed over the past year  rallying 63 9  against the 13 3  decline 

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from 16 cents to 58 cents over the last 60 days  We expect the company to post earnings growth of 3 6  in 2018  W T Offshore is expected to witness year over year earnings growth of 37 9  in 2019  surpassing the S P 500 index s 9 4  
In 2017  W T Offshore generated positive free cashflow of  28 million against negative free cashflow of  33 million in 2016  A partial recovery in crude prices primarily supported the improvement  Hence  the company generated sufficient operating cashflow during 2017 for financing its capital budget 
The company s cash balance surged 41  through 2017 while long term debt declined 4 3    marking three consecutive years of decline  This reflects the company s balance sheet strength 
W T Offshore has a strong earnings surprise history  The firm surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 542 8   We appreciate the company s solid cost control initiatives  In 2017  the company managed to lower total expenses by nearly 50  
The strong focus of the leading upstream energy player on oil rich prospective resources in the Gulf of Mexico is highly appreciated  W T Offshore s operations spread over 710 000 gross acres  which will likely support production growth

126076,347591,PXD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Centene  Western Digital  Concho Resources  Pioneer Natural Resources And Tyson Foods,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 4  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Centene Corporation   NYSE CNC    Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ WDC    Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO    Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   and Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog Could April Be a Better Month for Stocks  5 Large Cap PicksAfter enduring the toughest start to the year in recent times  markets have started the second quarter on a sorry note  U S  stocks have had their most disappointing start to April since 1929  And now trade war and tech stock related concerns are threatening to cause a deeper correction for the markets Historically  however  April has been a good month for stock gains  Also  first quarter earnings are likely to be strong  coming on the back of strong fourth numbers  A flurry of recent reports also suggests that the economy continues to be resilient And it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on all the warnings he has issued recently  Taking all these factors into consideration  picking large cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea at this point April Historically Strong for StocksGoing by historical data  April has traditionally been a productive month for U S  stocks  Data from the Stock Trader s Almanac for 2018 shows that the Dow has gained 1 9  on average during April since 1950  This means that April is the most profitable month for the Dow  going by average monthly returns Other major indexes also fair well during April  per the Almanac  For both the small cap heavy Russell 2000 and the S P 500  April is the third best month of the year  Both these indexes have increased 1 5  on the average every April since 1950  April is also the fourth best month for the Nasdaq  The tech heavy index has notched up a 1 4  average gain during the month  per historical data Data from independent broker dealer LPL Financial shows that gains in April have been particularly notable during the last few years  The S P 500 has ended April with gains 90  of the time over the past 10 years  The index has notched up an average gain of 2 2  over this period  The success rate of 90  is the highest for any month during this period  Also  average monthly gains are the third highest  after March and July  Strong Economy  Q1 Earnings to Boost StocksThe U S  economy had finished 2017 on a strong note  growing faster during the fourth quarter than earlier estimated  Business investment expanded during this period even as consumer spending hit a three year high The first economic reports for April indicate that the economy continues to be resilient  Though the ISM Manufacturing Index dipped slightly  the economy as a whole expanded for the 107th consecutive month  Construction spending also inched up in February Meanwhile  the outlook for first quarter earnings is particularly bright  coming on the back of strong results for the fourth quarter  As of Mar 23  total Q1 earnings for the S P 500 index were expected to be up  15 9  from the same period last year on  7 3  higher revenues  This would follow  13 5  earnings growth on  8 5  revenue growth in the preceding period   Read   Our ChoicesStocks have recently been buffeted by the twin concerns of an impending trade war with China and losses for tech stocks  While losses for tech stocks are likely temporary  it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on his warnings or opts for a compromise  Meanwhile  April remains a historically good month for stocks  Also  while the economy remains strong  prospects for first quarter earnings remain encouraging Given this backdrop  it seems prudent to bet on relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns  Large cap stocks are relatively safer bets  At the same time  it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short term benefits and the prospect of good long term performance  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a good VGM Score  You can see Centene Corporation is a well diversified  multi national healthcare company that primarily provides a set of services to the government sponsored healthcare programs Centene has a VGM Score of A  The company s projected growth rate for the current year is 40 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 21  over the last 60 days Western Digital Corporation headquartered in Irvine  California  is one

2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Comtech Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO    RSP Permian Inc    NYSE RSPP    EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG    Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   and Energen Corporation   NYSE EGN   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog 4 Ways to Get Rich Off Permian Basin Oil BoomConcho Resources Inc said last week that it will  RSP Permian Inc  for about  9 5 billion in the latest notable transaction involving the lucrative Permian Basin  The region has been gripped by a deal frenzy in the last few years  with a series of acquisitions  mergers and drilling rights involving both  Big Oil  and smaller energy companies  It is worth noting that among last year s energy deals  more than 36   valued at  24 3 billion  were Permian focused  reflecting its status as the dominant domestic growth area for onshore oil production Agreed  the sentiment in the oil market has not been this good in years  with U S  crude prices hitting a more than three year high of around  66 recently   a spectacular recovery from below  30 in early 2016 But regardless of the commodity s price movement though  one oil producing area that continues to attract investors is the low cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico  According to some estimates  the region   that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years   has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921  Incredibly  despite that impressive output history  analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come  In fact  Permian Basin is touted as the key reason that U S  crude production has now overtaken industry behemoth Saudi Arabia and is poised to surpass Russia shortly to become the global oil leader The Permian  Super  Basin A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south eastern part of New Mexico  the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75 000 square miles  almost half the size of California Experts say that it s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin  as compared to most other major fields  Moreover  there are certain parts of the shale play whose well returns are the best in the U S  With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels  well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability Per S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   the average wellhead break even price for oil producers in the Permian shale play has come down to a staggering  33 per barrel  Permian s attractive economics means that producers can make money and sustain growth there at the current   60 a barrel price The low operating cost stems from the region s extensive pipeline infrastructure  plentiful labor and supplies  and relatively warm winters that makes year round work possible  Most other domestic share regions need far higher prices to support new developments and expansions Unsurprisingly then  the Permian has drawn the lion s share of energy investment  Of late  more than a third of the total amount spent on all U S  deals was spent on   Permian land purchases and leases  No other major oil region in the country has come close to this activity Massive Reserve Potential Attracting ProducersAccording to business information provider IHS Markit  the Permian play is estimated to hold a staggering 60 70 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil    enough to feed all the domestic refineries for 12 years It is primarily because of the Permian shale that volume from U S  oil fields has risen 24  since mid 2016 to more than 10 4 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 Despite the slight uptick in service costs  a growing number of companies are devoting bulk of their investments into the Permian as they turn their attention to less expensive projects that can deliver cash quickly in today s  moderate oil  environment  The recent Concho RSP deal is likely to spur the  Permania  that has engulfed the U S  oil industry and herald another consolidation wave in the Permian region Four Permian Basin Oil Stocks to BuyThough a number of companies have built sizeable acreage positions in the Permian Basin  we have shortlisted four of them that might fetch you outstanding returns  Each of our picks boast of a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  You can see  Concho Resources  a  1 Ranked stock  is our first pick  The impending RSP Permian acquisition will make the Midland  TX based company one of the top energy producers in the lucrative play  The deal adds 92 000 acres of complementary holdings to Concho s Permian portfolio  expanding the total Permian acreage of the company to 640 000 net acres  The combined entity is set to run 27 rigs in the region  marking one of the largest drilling programs in the Permian shale play Then we have EOG Resources  Inc   This Zacks Rank  1 stock has significant interests in the Permian Basin  In 2016  the company scooped up privately held Yates Petroleum Corp for  2 5 billion to expand its holdings in the region  In the most recently reported quarter  EOG Resources  total volume rose 13 4  year over year to 60 9 million barrels of oil equivalent and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 MMBoe  This was primarily on account of higher production and improved well performance in the Permian Basin where it holds approximately 630 000 net acres Third on the list is Pioneer Natural Resources Company  An independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Irving  TX  the Rank  2 stock s growth continues to be focused on the Permian operations with more than 20 00 drilling locations across 750 000 gross acres  Its world class assets in the region is likely to see year over year production growth of 19 24  in 2018  In fact  Pioneer Natural Resources plans to operate 20 horizontal rigs in the play this year Energen Corporation is another company we recommend  This Birmingham  AL based Permian pure play boasts of acreage in some of the high quality areas of the Basin in the Delaware and Midland  Carrying a Zacks Rank of 2  Energen s top tier inventory of more than 4 000 net locations supports net  undeveloped resource potential of 2 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent  Coupled with ever improving operating efficiencies  the company expects year over year production

126123,347638,PXD,Zacks com Highlights  Athenahealth  Applied Materials  Pioneer Natural Resources And TriNet Group,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 4  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  athenahealth Inc   NASDAQ ATHN    Applied Materials Inc    NASDAQ AMAT    Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   and TriNet Group Inc    NYSE TNET   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Bet on These 4 Liquid Stocks for Solid ReturnsThe liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that many investors tend to ignore  It primarily indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents  Liquid stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

126149,347664,PXD,Here s Why Energen  EGN  Stock Might Be A Great Pick Now ,opinion,"Energen Corporation   NYSE EGN    on Mar 28  was upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The  5 25 billion market cap exploration and production company has a lot to offer its investors as shown below 
Why the Upgrade 
Analysts  View
The company has witnessed six positive estimate revisions for its current quarter in the past 60 days against a single negative revision  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has also moved higher over the same period from 60 cents per share to 70 cents per share  During the same time period  eight analysts bumped up their estimates for 2018  pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year to  3 17 a share from  2 38 
Positive Catalysts
Energen s first quarter 2018 revenues are expected to go up 37 9  year over year  while its sales for the whole year are anticipated to surge 40 1   This is supported by the company s expectation of increasing full year 2018 production by 25  from 2017  The Permian Basin focused company expects the increase in output to continue as its annual production is estimated to reach the level of 160 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBoe d  by 2020 
Additionally  Energen s total proved oil equivalent reserves   as of Dec 31  2017   was 444 million barrels  40  higher than 2016  most of which is in the low cost Permian Basin 
Moreover  the oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history  the average positive earnings surprise being 19 7  in the trailing four quarters 
The good news does not stop here  Energen has set a capital budget of  1 1  1 3 billion for 2018 that will be spent for the oil rich projects  The decision seems impressive given that the company has a low leverage than the it belongs to  giving it the room to take loans without hurting its balance sheet   

Moreover  the company s 2018 guidance states that per unit spending is expected to go down significantly from 2017  Net salaries and general   administrative expense  production costs  marketing   transportation and DD A expense are anticipated to reflect most of the declines in spending 
Also  the Birmingham  AL based upstream energy firm has gained 10 3  in the last year against its industry s 8 5  decline

126155,347670,PXD,Here s Why You Should Scoop Up Stone Energy Stock Right Now ,opinion,"On Mar 27  Stone Energy Corporation   NYSE SGY   was raised to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Why the Upgrade 
For first quarter 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised upward from 38 cents to 39 cents over the last 60 days  The consensus mark for current year earnings was raised to  1 78 from  1 43   
The company s free cashflow for 2017 was recorded at  535 million against negative free cashflow of  161 million in 2016  Partial recovery in crude prices primarily supported the massive improvement  Hence  Stone Energy generated sufficient operating cashflow during 2017 for financing its capital budget 
Stone Energy has negligible current debt as its long term debt contracted 33 2  through 2017  Moreover  cash balances surged 48 1  last year  reflecting considerable balance sheet strength  The company s pricing chart looks impressive  Over the past year  the stock has rallied 68 9   outperforming the  10 4  decline 

 
We appreciate the company s strong foothold in the Gulf of Mexico   which offers abundant crude reserves  With innumerable discoveries of oil fields in the Gulf regions  the company estimated total Gulf reserves of more than 50 billion barrels  The company s allocation of 36  capital budget for 2018 toward exploration activities in the prospective oil and gas resources is highly positive especially when crude prices recovered from historical lows touched during early 2016  The price of West Texas Intermediate crude recently crossed the  65 per barrel mark  way higher than historical low mark of  26 21 per barrel in February 2016 
Other Stocks to Consider
Other prospective players in the energy space include W T Offshore  Inc    NYSE WTI    Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   and Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO    All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Headquartered in Houston  TX  W T Offshore is primarily an upstream energy player  It is expected to witness year over year earnings growth of 3 6  in 2018 
Headquartered in Irving  TX  Pioneer Natural Resources is an upstream energy firm  It has an average positive earnings surprise of 66 9  for the last four quarters 
Headquartered in Midland  TX  Concho is also an upstream energy company  It will likely see a year over year surge of 73 2  in 2018 earnings

126157,347672,PXD,PetroChina  PTR  Pays Big Dividend As Oil Rally Boosts Profit,opinion,"PetroChina Co  Ltd    NYSE PTR   announced 2017 earnings of RMB 22 793 million or RMB 0 12 per diluted share compared with RMB 7 900 million or RMB 0 04 per diluted share a year earlier  Moreover  China s dominant oil and gas producer s total revenue for the year jumped 24 7  from 2016 to RMB 2 015 890 million 
The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices  which helped its exploration and production unit to report a jump in profitability  Interestingly  the company has decided to pay all of its annual profit of RMB 22 793 million as interim dividend to its stockholders   something it did in the first half as well 
PetroChina followed another big energy name from the country   Sinopec   NYSE SNP     in reporting encouraging results  Sinopec also saw its profit surge as the largest petroleum and petrochemical company in Asia managed to generate strong petrochemical margins 
Following the robust showing  PetroChina has decided to boost 2018 capital expenditure  The group pegged its 2018 capital budget at RMB 225 800 million  up 4 4  from what it invested in 2017 as it focuses to cash in on the recovery in crude prices 
However  the Chinese energy giant s earnings per ADR came in at  1 90  unable to match the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 82 on higher expenses and losses from gas imports 
12 Month Segment Performance
Upstream  PetroChina  one of the world s largest oil company by market value  posted disappointing upstream output during the twelve months ended Dec 31  2017  In particular  crude oil output   accounting for 61  of the total   fell 3 7  from the year ago period to 887 million barrels  MMBbl   This was partly offset by marketable natural gas output  which was up 4 5  to 3 423 4 billion cubic feet  Bcf   As a result  PetroChina s total production of oil and natural gas declined by a marginal 0 6  year over year to 1 457 8 million barrels of oil equivalent 
However  average realized crude oil price during 2017 was  50 64 per barrel  33 3  higher than the year ago period  This buoyed the upstream  or exploration   production  segment results  which posted an operating income of RMB 15 475 million compared to a much smaller operating profit of RMB 3 148 million in 2016 
Downstream  The Beijing based company s  Refining   Chemicals  business generated an operating income of RMB 39 961 million  This marks a slight increase from the year earlier period earnings of RMB 39 026 million  The improvement in the downstream division was due to cost control initiatives  higher share of high valued added chemical products and operational flexibility to adjust to market conditions 
PetroChina s refinery division processed 1 016 9 MMBbl of crude oil during the twelve month period  up 6 7  from 2016  The company produced 9 284 million tons of synthetic resin in the period  a rise of 2 3  year over year   besides manufacturing 5 764 million tons of ethylene  up 3 1    It also produced 92 715 million tons of gasoline  diesel and kerosene during the period against 86 022 million tons a year earlier 
Natural Gas   Pipelines  Revenue rose 19 5  to RMB 295 786 million on higher natural gas sales volumes  Still  PetroChina lost money to the tune of RMB 23 947 million on the sales of imported natural gas and liquefied natural gas  LNG  from Central Asia and Burma  This pulled down the group s natural gas business  income to RMB 15 688 million in 2017  a 12 3  decline from the year earlier profit of RMB 17 885 million 
Marketing  In marketing operations  the state owned group sold 169 5 million tons of gasoline  diesel and kerosene during Jan Dec 2017  an increase of 6 5  year over year  Higher volumes were accompanied by improved product prices due to which sales for the division were up 27 6  to RMB 1 660 456 million 
However  a number of adverse factors   spiraling operating expenses and fierce competition   meant that the segment reported a profit of RMB 8 279 million   lower than the prior year s RMB 11 048 million 
Liquidity   Capital Expenditure
At the end of 2017  the stock s cash balance was RMB 122 777 million  while cash flow from operating activities was RMB 366 655 million  Capital expenditure for the year was RMB 216 227 million  up 25 4  from the year ago level

126188,347703,PXD,US Exploration Industry Holds Up Well  4 Oil Stocks To Buy,opinion,The energy sector has always been a key driver of the quarterly outperformance of the S P 500 index  In the fourth quarter  the index recorded year over year earnings growth of 13 5   However  excluding Energy  S P 500 s earnings growth was 11 2   Also  for first quarter 2018  we expect Energy to surpass all other sectors  posting earnings growth of 65 7  Among all the industries belonging to the Energy sector   seems lucrative with healthy free cash flow and declining debt load  Partial crude price recovery is also a positive for the industry Oil   Gas U S  Exploration   Production Industry The firms belonging to this industry are involved in exploration and production of oil and natural gas in prospective resources   like the Permian basin  Eagle Ford  Utica and the Appalachian basin   spread all over the United States Operating in this industry needs huge capital spending  The explorers are vulnerable to volatility in oil and gas prices  But  the industry is rewarding too  Partial recovery in oil prices is highly favorable for this industry  From the historical low mark of  26 21 per barrel hit in February 2016  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude rose beyond the  60 psychological level  The extension of the production cut deal  first signed in late 2016  by the OPEC players through the end of 2018  primarily initiated the rally in crude Per the   EIA   average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been  63 70 per barrel and  62 23 per barrel  respectively  The average monthly oil price had never traded near the  60 per barrel mark since 2015 The AnalysisThere are few parameters that clearly show that investors willing to invest in the energy space should consider this industry Industry RankIn terms of the   the Oil   Gas US Exploration   Production industry is among the top performing industries The industry is ranked  96 and lies in the top 38  of all industries  The industry has a good industry rank  as the top 50  of the Zacks Ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Decent Upside PotentialWe have employed a trailing 12 month Enterprise Multiple for determining the value of the industry  This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt for investing in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing a company or industry Enterprise Multiple   Enterprise Value  EV  EBITDAWe calculate the current EV EBITDA value for Oil   Gas US Exploration   Production industry at 12 99  Although the stock s current valuation is higher than its five year median EV  EBITDA of 6 96  the current value is still lower than its five year high EV EBITDA of 16 61  reflecting the industry s healthy upside potential Sufficient Free Cash Flow to Fund Capital SpendingAfter subtracting capital spending from operating cash flow  we get free cash flow  This is one of the most important parameters when it comes to exploration activities  Positive free cash flow for an industry or a company means the firm is in a position to fund its core operations with its operating cashflow and hence don t have to rely on debt market heavily Last year  the Oil   Gas US Exploration   Production industry spent  935 million of capital and earned  1 2 billion of operating cashflow  Eventually  the industry s free cash flow was recorded at  248 million  2 3  higher than 2016  Most importantly  the industry recorded negative free cash flow of  601 million during 2015  thanks to weak crude prices  from where free cash flow turned positive to  242 million in 2016 Declining Debt LoadFrom mid 2014  the market witnessed free fall in crude prices  Following this  it was difficult for explorers to continue their operations and they had to depend on debt financing  Eventually  the balance sheet of most of the explorers were loaded with huge debt But  with the partial recovery in crude prices  both the long term and current debt load of the Oil   Gas US Exploration   Production industry fell drastically Focus on Oil ExplorersPicking oil explorers seems to be a smart option at this moment  However  selecting winning stocks may be a daunting task This is where our proprietary comes in handy  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and other parameters

126189,347704,PXD,3 Strong Oil Picks For A Volatile Stock Market,opinion,"Stocks battled to stay in the green during Friday morning trading  with major indexes like the S P 500 hoping to rebound after surrendering their year to date gains over the course of this brutal trading week  But a strong bump in oil prices helped the energy sector generate momentum on Friday morning  and if energy stocks continue to surge in this volatile market  investors need to be properly exposed to this sector 
This week s volatility was inspired by new worries over an impending trade war with China  with President Trump on Thursday directing U S  trade representatives to level tariffs on about  50 billion worth of Chinese imports 
Of course  some sectors are more at risk to trade concerns than others  and the energy sector itself is more contingent on the price of key natural resources  And those commodities moved higher on Friday morning  Specifically  May contracts for Light Crude Oil surged about 1 6  on the back of renewed hopes of extended OPEC production cuts 
Overall  the S P 500 Energy sector gained nearly 1 3  in morning trading  making it the day s biggest winner so far  With this in mind  let s take a look at three strong oil stocks that stand to benefit from increasing prices  even if the broader market remains volatile 
1  Pioneer Natural Resources Company    NYSE PXD   
Pioneer Natural Resources is a large  Texas based independent exploration and production company  Analyst sentiment surrounding the stock has improved significantly over the past few weeks  evidenced by 14 positive revisions for the company s full year EPS estimates  Our consensus mark for Pioneer s full year earnings per share has gained  2 29 over the past 60 days 
This positive revision activity has helped PXD earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Meanwhile  Pioneer is generating cash flow growth of nearly 21  right now  outpacing its industry s average  The company is also projected to see earnings growth of 187  on the back of 22  revenue growth this year  And the stock is about  10 off its 52 week high  so investors have plenty of room to ride shares higher before it tests a new range 
 
2  Continental Resources  Inc     NYSE CLR   
Continental Resources is a crude oil concentrated  independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the Rocky Mountain  Mid Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States  Analyst estimates have trended higher recently  with our Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLR s full year EPS gaining  1 01 within the past two months  That activity has helped the company earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Continental is another company that is improving its financial position  generating 35  cash flow growth and bringing in about  5 in cash per share right now  The company also presents better than industry average net margin and RoE  CLR is another aggressive growth pick for 2018  with current estimates calling for revenue growth of 42  and EPS improvement of 359  
 
3  CNOOC Limited    NYSE CEO   
Cnooc Limited is a company that engages primarily in the exploration  development and production of crude oil and natural gas offshore China  Chinese oil producers should come out of any trade war relatively unscathed  as both countries have more important trade partners for black gold  CEO is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Analyst estimates have also been trending higher for this company  evidenced by the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its full year earnings moving  1 41 higher within the past 60 days  The stock also has a  B  grade for Value in our Style Scores system and is trading at just 9x forward 12 month earnings

126190,347705,PXD,Enhance Your Returns With 5 Relative Price Strength Stocks,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming

126194,347709,PXD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  CNOOC  Continental Resources And Pioneer Natural Resources,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 26  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include CNOOC Limited   NYSE CEO    Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR   and Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  3 Strong Oil Picks for a Volatile MarketStocks battled to stay in the green during Friday morning trading  with major indexes like the S P 500 hoping to rebound after surrendering their year to date gains over the course of this brutal trading week  But a strong bump in oil prices helped the energy sector generate momentum on Friday morning  and if energy stocks continue to surge in this volatile market  investors need to be properly exposed to this sector This week s volatility was inspired by new worries over an impending trade war with China  with President Trump on Thursday directing U S  trade representatives to level tariffs on about  50 billion worth of Chinese imports Of course  some sectors are more at risk to trade concerns than others  and the energy sector itself is more contingent on the price of key natural resources  And those commodities moved higher on Friday morning  Specifically  May contracts for Light Crude Oil surged about 1 6  on the back of renewed hopes of extended OPEC production cuts Overall  the S P 500 Energy sector gained nearly 1 3  in morning trading  making it the day s biggest winner so far  With this in mind  let s take a look at three strong oil stocks that stand to benefit from increasing prices  even if the broader market remains volatile 1  Pioneer Natural Resources CompanyPioneer Natural Resources is a large  Texas based independent exploration and production company  Analyst sentiment surrounding the stock has improved significantly over the past few weeks  evidenced by 14 positive revisions for the company s full year EPS estimates  Our consensus mark for Pioneer s full year earnings per share has gained  2 29 over the past 60 days This positive revision activity has helped PXD earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Meanwhile  Pioneer is generating cash flow growth of nearly 21  right now  outpacing its industry s average  The company is also projected to see earnings growth of 187  on the back of 22  revenue growth this year  And the stock is about  10 off its 52 week high  so investors have plenty of room to ride shares higher before it tests a new range 2  Continental Resources  Inc Continental Resources is a crude oil concentrated  independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the Rocky Mountain  Mid Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States  Analyst estimates have trended higher recently  with our Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLR s full year EPS gaining  1 01 within the past two months  That activity has helped the company earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Continental is another company that is improving its financial position  generating 35  cash flow growth and bringing in about  5 in cash per share right now  The company also presents better than industry average net margin and RoE  CLR is another aggressive growth pick for 2018  with current estimates calling for revenue growth of 42  and EPS improvement of 359  3  CNOOC LimitedCnooc Limited is a company that engages primarily in the exploration  development and production of crude oil and natural gas offshore China  Chinese oil producers should come out of any trade war relatively unscathed  as both countries have more important trade partners for black gold  CEO is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Analyst estimates have also been trending higher for this company

the sector is not on par with the index  We have employed trailing 12 month Enterprise Multiple for determining the value of the sector  This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt for investing on growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing company or industry Enterprise Multiple   Enterprise Value  EV    EBITDAOur proprietary model calculates EV  EBITDA for the Energy sector at 6 53  lower than the index s 11 8 Impressive Q4 ResultsAmong all the 16 sectors defining the index  only energy recorded triple digit Q4 earnings growth of 157 2   During fourth quarter 2017  the Energy sector generated profits of  11 4 billion  compared with the respective  11 billion   8 1 billion and  9 1 billion during the last three quarters   Also  the trailing 12 month results show 271 6  earnings growth for Energy on 17 5  higher revenues  Per our data base  the sector raked in  39 3 billion profits in 2017  significantly higher than  9 2 billion through 2016 Higher oil prices primarily drove the sector s performance  From the historical low mark of  26 21 per barrel touched in February 2016  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude rose beyond the  60 psychological level  The extension of the production cut deal  first signed in late 2016  by the OPEC players through the end of 2018  primarily supported the rally in crude Strong Earnings OutlookWe expect the Energy sector to earn  15 2 billion through the January to March quarter of 2018  up 33 3  sequentially  Moreover  in the second and third quarters of this year  the sector will likely report earnings of  17 4 billion and  17 5 billion  respectively The forward 12 month earnings growth of the Energy sector stands at 88 6  on 18 4  higher revenues  On top of that  for 2018 and 2019  we project earnings of  66 9 billion and  72 6 billion  significantly higher than 2017 profits The primary factors driving the expectations are tax cut and crude recovery  The Energy sector has long been a major tax payer with a median tax rate of 36 8  for the last 11 years  per the corporate tax calculator of MarketWatch  With a 21  tax rate  oil and gas companies will definitely save a lot of money  which could be directed toward growth and maintenance projects Moreover  major energy players have started banking on the partial crude recovery  Global crude demand will also be a driving factor  believes The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS    The leading investment bank added that although a trade war might affect oil demand slowly  a weaker dollar could nullify the negative impact  This makes Goldman confident about its daily crude demand growth projection of 1 85 million barrels during 2018 Stocks in FocusRecord low jobless claims  robust jobs addition and healthy GDP numbers have been backing the market s bull run  The chart provided below clearly shows that after a fall in   the S P 500 continues to move up at a steady pace  making the stock market significantly overvalued However  energy is still undervalued despite its strong fundamentals and excellent earnings history  Picking oil explorers seems to be a smart option at this moment  However  selecting the winning stocks may be a daunting task This is where our  comes in handy  Here  V stands for Value  G for Growth  and M for Momentum  and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such

126315,347830,PXD,Are U S  Shale Oil Producers And OPEC Heading Toward An Agreement ,opinion,"The biggest players in energy are descending on Houston  TX this week for the annual CERAWeek energy conference hosted by IHS Markit which began on Monday  One event drawing significant attention was the dinner meeting on Monday night between some OPEC members and the CEOs of a few key American shale oil companies  The first such dinner took place last year at the same  and OPEC has continued to keep in contact with those it sees as key players  including leaders in the shale industry and investors 
Although these meetings receive a great deal of attention from the press  market watchers should understand that under no circumstances would any American oil company ever enter into any agreement with OPEC  Even the pretense of holding discussions for any kind of joint activities would draw the attention of the U S  Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice for a potential violation of anti trust laws 
Though OPEC is partnering with non OPEC oil producing countries like Russia and Kazakhstan  U S  companies will not be a part of this  There have been a few times in the past when American oil companies were granted special immunity from anti trust laws to cooperate with other oil companies  but only for matters vital to U S  national security  There is no national security interest here for the United States 
If not to collude  what are OPEC and U S  oil companies discussing with one another  The former CEO of EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Mark Papa  told the  that he planned to tell Mohammed Barkindo  the Secretary General of OPEC  that the position of shale oil companies is not as good as some believe  He reportedly intended to say that  despite the common belief in the market  shale companies are not very capable of ramping of production and sustaining high levels of production  After the dinner  according to   he declined to comment on what was said 
The point of the meeting is not for OPEC and shale to reach a unified conclusion about the market  or even for shale oil producers to  educate  OPEC about their business   The sophisticated leaders within OPEC are already quite educated on shale   The point is merely to show the market that they are meeting  enhance speculation and surreptitiously glean an insight or two into the business strategies of other key players 
Remember  the CEOs of Chesapeake  NYSE CHK   Hess  NYSE HES   Pioneer Resources  NYSE PXD   Occidental  NYSE OXY   Centennial  NASDAQ CDEV  and others will be just as interested in what their fellow shale CEOs tell OPEC as they are in what OPEC has to say   Keep your friends close and your  competitors  closer  ",2018-03-07,"Ellen R.

126336,347851,PXD,Zacks com Highlights  Athenahealth  Commercial Vehicle Group  Pioneer Natural Resources And Shutterfly,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 28  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  athenahealth Inc    NASDAQ ATHN    Commercial Vehicle Group Inc    NASDAQ CVGI    Pioneer Natural Resources Co    NYSE PXD   and Shutterfly Inc    NASDAQ SFLY   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Bet on These 4 Top Liquid Stocks for Solid ReturnsLiquidity is an important yardstick that many investors tend to ignore  It primarily indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining

company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks

dividend from  0 04 to  0 16   0 32 per share on an annualized basis   Management s TakeAccording to Timothy L  Dove  President and CEO   The Company delivered another excellent quarter  with strong earnings  solid execution  robust oil production growth  excellent horizontal well performance in the Permian Basin and reduced production costs  Our world class Permian Basin asset is considered by many to be the top oil shale play in North America  We are drilling low cost  highly productive wells that generate high rates of return as a result of a low all in cost structure of approximately  19

underperforming brands  and the Toys  R  Us bankruptcy filing as the reasons for the decline   On the International side  net sales dropped by  9  while gross sales fell by  1  in constant currency

is attempting to turn the company around   Mattel can continued to build on two successful areas  the Barbie brand that saw shipments increases by 9   and the company s overall improvement in its inventory retail position   Further  management is currently accelerating its cost reduction efforts   But the issue of visibility remains  so it is not clear when and how successful its turnaround

our economic model and rapidly improve profitability  We are optimistic about stabilizing revenue in 2018 anchored by our key power brands  entertainment partnerships and exciting new launches  We continue to gain momentum toward the medium term goals we shared at our June Investor Day  Additional content Wells Fargo Gains Amid Gov t Backlash  Berkshire SupportWells Fargo stock surged over 2 60  on Wednesday  despite reports that Sen  Elizabeth Warren sent a critical letter to CEO Tim Sloan  questioning the embattled banking giant s recent customer refund initiatives Sen  Warren called out Sloan and Wells Fargo just days after the Wall Street Journal  that the company s latest wave of consumer refunds were marred by missteps  An array of mistakes large and small were reportedly made during the company s effort to repay customers hurt by improper fees on car loans and home mortgages Wells Fargo  last August that the company charged nearly 600 000 customers for auto insurance they didn t need and improperly charged 110 000 customers fees related to their mortgage rates  This comes on top of Wells Fargo s massive fake account scandal that forced the bank s previous CEO to step down in the fall of 2016 In her Feb  13 letter  Sen  Warren  nearly a dozen questions and accused Wells Fargo s current CEO of breaking his promise to customers  However  the bank also received some praise from one of its biggest investors in the wake of Sen  Warren s letter Berkshire Backing Berkshire Hathaway s Vice Chairman Charlie Munger supported Wells Fargo on Wednesday while he spoke at the Daily Journal Corporation s annual meeting in Los Angeles  Of course  Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction      Of course  they were too slow in reacting to the bad news when it came  Everyone makes those mistakes  but we make fewer than others  Munger went on to say that it s  time for the regulators to let up on Wells Fargo  and that long term the bank and its customers will likely be better off  It seems clear that the Berkshire executive thinks punishments levied against the company have been more than fair Wells Fargo fired more than 5 000 employees in relation to its initial fraudulent account scandal and was also fined  185 million  More recently  in one of her final acts as head of the Federal Reserve  Janet Yellen and regulators notified Wells Fargo that is could not grow beyond the  1 95 trillion in total assets it ended 2017 with  until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls  As one of Warren Buffett s right hand men  what Munger says can carry significant weight  But it is unclear if federal regulators will care about what he has to say  as Wells Fargo was Berkshire s top holding as of its most recent

Meanwhile  quarterly revenues of C 3 941 million increased from C 3 352 million in the year ago quarter Suncor Energy Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   ProductionTotal upstream production in the reported quarter was 736 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d   which decreased marginally from the prior year level of 738 500 BOE d  The decline in production was due to a drop in output from the Syncrude operations and the Exploration and Production segment Oil Sands operations volume was 446 800 barrels per day  Bbl d  compared with 433 400 Bbl d in the year ago quarter  The increase can be attributed to improved mining and extraction reliability and record Firebag production  partially offset by the lower production at MacKay River Production from Syncrude operations was 174 400 Bbl d compared with 187 000 Bbl d in the year ago quarter  The decrease was due to the lower upgrader reliability  In the quarter under review  the Syncrude upgrader reliability was 94  lower than year ago quarter s 102  Suncor s Exploration and Production segment  consisting of International and Offshore and Natural Gas segments  produced 115 200 BOE d compared with 118 100 BOE d in the prior year quarter  Lower offshore production drove the company s results  partially offset by the increased output in Libya Notably  Suncor s newly commissioned Hebron asset started production in this quarter  ahead of its schedule Also  refinery utilization came in at 94  compared with 93  in the year ago quarter Product SalesThe company s refined product sales of 526 800 Bbl d increased from the prior year quarter level of 514 800 Bbl d owing to strong reliability at most of Suncor s refineries  It was partially offset by the impact of Montreal refinery s third party power outage ExpensesTotal expenses in the reported quarter declined to C 7 156 million from C 7 415 million in the year ago quarter  The company s financing expenses decreased C 225 million compared with C 532 million incurred in the year ago quarter   Lower exploration  depreciation and transportation expenses also lowered expenses  The results were partly offset by increased costs related to purchase of crude oil and products Balance Sheet   Capital ExpendituresAs of Dec 31  2017  Suncor had cash and cash equivalents of C 2 672 million and total long term debt of C 13 372 million  The total debt to

shareholders of record as of Mar 5 GuidanceThe full year outlook range for E P production is envisioned to lie within 105 000 115 000 Boe d   The same for Syncrude production is projected between 150 000 Bbls d and165 000 Bbls d   Furthermore  the full year outlook range for Syncrude cash operating costs anticipated to lie in the  32 50  35 50 bbl band For 2018  the estimated capex came in at  4 5

126436,347951,PXD,4 Impressive Liquid Stocks For Maximum Returns,opinion,Liquidity indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash and equivalents  Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see  Growth

126462,347977,PXD,5 Of The Best Efficient Stocks For Your Portfolio,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency  Efficiency  a company s ability to transform inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory  Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers     The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 22 Here are five stocks from the 22 that made it through the screen Lululemon Athletica   NASDAQ LULU    an athletic apparel company  together with its subsidiaries  designs  distributes  and retails athletic apparel and accessories for women  men  and female youth  The company

into cash  Investors seeking solid returns may invest in companies that boast a favorable liquidity position However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see   Growth Style

126517,348032,PXD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  EOG Resources  Continental Resources  Pioneer Natural And Matador Resources,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 25  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG    Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR    Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD    Matador Resources Company   NYSE MTDR   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  U S  Could Emerge as Largest Oil Producer  Ahead of Saudi and RussiaU S  shale players and Saudi Arabia have recently adopted various strategies to cope with the different phases of the energy sector  The goal has been to combat the persistent weakness in crude  and to gain an edge in the race to win title of the world s largest oil producer The current business scenario is quite profitable for the United Sates  as crude prices recovered partially after OPEC decided to extend the production cut deal  The uptick in oil prices may encourage more shale players to gather on domestic oil resources and thereby boost production  The International Energy Agency  IEA  expects the United States to become the world s second largest oil producer in 2018  outpacing Saudi Arabia  IEA also expects 2018 to be a remarkable year  as U S  shale players have the potential to outpace even Russia  the largest oil producer in the world OPEC Deal Supports Partial Crude RecoverySince the beginning of 2018  crude has been trading above the  60 per barrel psychological mark  Notably  for the first time after 2014  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude started the year above  60  We view it as partial recovery as the commodity traded above  100 a barrel before mid 2014  The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally On Nov 30  2017  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  beyond the first quarter of 2018  More than 20 oil producers  including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia  participated in the meeting  As expected by most analysts  all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018 end  Saudi Arabia  Russia  and their allies have pledged to put 1 8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of market US Shale Players to BenefitThe rally in crude is favorable for U S  drillers  In fact  drillers in the domestic shale plays have been ramping up operations following a more than  rise in oil prices in 2017  As per the recent rig count report of Houston based oilfield services player Baker Hughes  a GE company  BHGE   the total number of rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States jumped from 665 to 929 through 2017 Higher drilling resulted in increased production  IEA added that the surge in U S  production by 0 6 million barrels per day in 2017  thanks to the shale revolution  backed the increase in global crude output despite OPEC s compliance with the production cut deal Per IEA  the daily production of crude in the United States is recorded at 9 9 million barrels  the maximum in the past five decades  On top of that  IEA elevated the projection for oil production growth through 2018 to 1 1 million barrels per day from 870 000 in a recent report  If the projections come true  the United Sates will surpass Saudi Arabia   the world s second largest producer of crude   with a historic production of more than 10 million barrels a day Time to Focus on Shale PlayersCost cutting measures and efficient operations have helped U S  shale players bounce back  said IEA  Also  new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  could reduce the dependence of United States on foreign crude and will help the country to export domestic crude to more nations globally  said CNBC  Picking winning oil stocks seems prudent at the moment  We have employed our proprietary to zero in on companies with solid Zacks Rank and other favorable parameters  Headquartered in Houston  TX  EOG Resources  Inc  is a leading upstream energy player  The company holds premium acreages in the Permian  Bakken and Eagle Ford oil shale plays in the United States We expect the company to report earnings growth of 157 2  and 206 9  in 2017 and 2018  respectively  EOG Resources sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Continental Resources  Inc   based in Oklahoma City  OK  is an exploration player with a focus on Bakken shale resources  The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 69 5  for the last four quarters The Zacks  1 Ranked player will likely post year over year earnings growth of 139 8  and 294 7  in 2017 and 2018  respectively Headquartered in Irving  TX  Pioneer Natural Resources Company

Strong Q4 Growth  Top 5 StocksAs we enter the Q4 earnings season  this week will see reports from key energy companies  The partial recovery in crude price has strengthened the financial metrics of the energy sector   as represented by the Zacks Oil Energy sector   and helped them pay off a part of their huge debt The sector now has sufficient net operating cashflow to fund their capital spending  Also  the energy sector s 3 7  dividend yield is lucrative  and is more than the 1 8  yield of the S P 500   We believe that the fourth quarter earnings season will likely see the strongest gain from the energy sector among all Zacks sectors Higher Oil   Gas PricesThe West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude increased almost 20  in the October to December quarter of 2017  per   Through most of November and the entire December  the commodity traded above the  55 per barrel psychological mark  The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude   On Nov 30  2017  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  beyond the first quarter of 2018  More than 20 oil producers

more than  through the fourth quarter 2017 Q4 Earnings Growth Likely to be ImpressiveAmong all the 16 Zacks sectors defining the S P 500 index  energy will likely witness the strongest earnings growth in the fourth quarter  per our latest   In other words  energy will likely be the only Zacks sector to report triple digit earnings growth For the October to December quarter  we expect energy to post 178 5  earnings growth on 24 1  higher revenues  The rise in fourth quarter earnings will likely be more than 152 3  recorded in third quarter 2017 Bet on Oil Energy StocksCrude and natural gas prices determine the fate of the energy players  With the massive fourth quarter crude and gas improvements  upstream energy players are expected to report strong Q4 numbers  Companies involved in

126554,348069,PXD,US Could Emerge As Largest Oil Producer Ahead Of Saudi  Russia,opinion,U S  shale players and Saudi Arabia have recently adopted various strategies to cope with the different phases of the energy sector  The goal has been to combat the persistent weakness in crude  and to gain an edge in the race to win title of the world s largest oil producer The current business scenario is quite profitable for the United Sates  as crude prices recovered partially after OPEC decided to extend the production cut deal  The uptick in oil prices may encourage more shale players to gather on domestic oil resources and thereby boost production  The International Energy Agency  IEA  expects the United States to become the world s second largest oil producer in 2018  outpacing Saudi Arabia  IEA also expects 2018 to be a remarkable year  as U S  shale players have the potential to outpace even Russia  the largest oil producer in the world OPEC Deal Supports Partial Crude RecoverySince the beginning of 2018  crude has been trading above the  60 per barrel psychological mark  Notably  for the first time after 2014  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude started the year above  60  We view it as partial recovery as the commodity traded above  100 a barrel before mid 2014  The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally On Nov 30  2017  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  beyond the first quarter of 2018  More than 20 oil producers  including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia  participated in the meeting  As expected by most analysts  all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018 end  Saudi Arabia  Russia  and their allies have pledged to put 1 8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of market US Shale Players to BenefitThe rally in crude is favorable for U S  drillers  In fact  drillers in the domestic shale plays have been ramping up operations following a more than  rise in oil prices in 2017  As per the recent rig count report of Houston based oilfield services player Baker Hughes  a GE company  BHGE   the total number of rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States jumped from 665 to 929 through 2017 Higher drilling resulted in increased production  IEA added that the surge in U S  production by 0 6 million barrels per day in 2017  thanks to the shale revolution  backed the increase in global crude output despite OPEC s compliance with the production cut deal Per IEA  the daily production of crude in the United States is recorded at 9 9 million barrels  the maximum in the past five decades  On top of that  IEA elevated the projection for oil production growth through 2018 to 1 1 million barrels per day from 870 000 in a recent report  If the projections come true  the United Sates will surpass Saudi Arabia   the world s second largest producer of crude   with a historic production of more than 10 million barrels a day Time to Focus on Shale PlayersCost cutting measures and efficient operations have helped U S  shale players bounce back  said IEA  Also  new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  could reduce the dependence of United States on foreign crude and will help the country to export domestic crude to more nations globally  said CNBC  Picking winning oil stocks seems prudent at the moment  We have employed our proprietary to zero in on companies with solid Zacks Rank and other favorable parameters  Headquartered in Houston  TX  EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   is a leading upstream energy player  The company holds premium acreages in the Permian  Bakken and Eagle Ford oil shale plays in the United States We expect the company to report earnings growth of 157 2  and 206 9  in 2017 and 2018  respectively  EOG Resources sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR    based in Oklahoma City  OK  is an exploration player with a focus on Bakken shale resources  The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 69 5  for the last four quarters The Zacks

126585,348100,PXD,Valero Or Phillips 66  Which Is A Better Pick For 2018 ,opinion,Toward the end of 2017  we saw partial recovery in oil prices  Solid demand growth  declining inventories and the extension of OPEC led supply cuts until the end of 2018 is keeping the market steady and supporting strong uptrend While there might be a number of winners within the energy sector  refiners have stood out amid weakness in the commodity prices  Moreover  the overhaul of the nation s tax code is expected to benefit the refiners  With the implementation of the law  the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35  to 21   which will benefit the refiners This is because unlike crude producers and equipment makers who have been victims of stubborn low oil price environment and struggled to generate positive cash flows  refiners have been among the handful of energy sub industries displaying strength during the shaky period The business of downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices  This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline  the prime transportation fuel in the United States  Hence  lower the oil price  higher will be their profits  Therefore  the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel   also known as refining margin or crack spread   has been going up over the past few quarters Consequently  these companies   having generated positive income before taxes   are in a much better shape to take advantage of the current situation  Consequently  shares of the major downstream operators have been rising lately  In this context  we put the spotlight on two of the refining players   Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   and Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO     with market caps of  50 92 billion and  38 28 billion  respectively  Since both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals Valero Beats on the BoursesOver the past year  Valero surpassed the industry s gain of 22 6  as well as S P 500 index s rally of 21 3   Moreover  Valero s rise of 40 4  has outshined Phillips 66 s returns of 20 3  ValuationPhillips 66 and Valero have P E ratios of 29 4 and 20 3  respectively  Clearly  Valero is the cheaper proposition  Notably  while Valero is underpriced  Phillips 66 is overpriced compared with the industry s P E ratio of 25 4 LiquidityThe liquidity of a company is determined through quick ratio which is a more stringent test to measure the capability of a company to pay both short  and long term obligations Valero has a better liquidity than the industry s level of 1 02 and that of Phillips 66 s 0 86  Valero s quick ratio of 1 24 puts it in a more comfortable position to meet short term obligations Return on Capital  ROC Coming to Phillips 66 and Valero  ROC for the trailing 12 months is 5 4  and 7 1   respectively  which are above the sector s level of 5 3  Last Quarter Performance   ProjectionsPhillips 66 delivered impressive results in third quarter 2017 wherein adjusted earnings per share not only surged 58 1  year over year to  1 66 but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62  Phillips 66 expects year over year earnings growth of 60 28  and 39 39  in 2017 and 2018  respectively Valero s third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings surged over54  year over year to  1 91 per share  also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 83  Valero expects year over year growth of 34 41  and 29 68  in its earnings in 2017 and 2018  respectively In terms of long term growth expectations  Phillips 66 scores above Valero  The expected growth rate for Phillips 66 for the next 3 5 years is 10 00  compared with an expected growth of 9 86  for Valero Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history  Phillips 66 seems to be a clear winner  Phillips 66 delivered average positive earnings surprise of 429 3  in the trailing four quarters  However  the Valero reported average negative earnings surprise of 10 3  in the same period Dividend YieldIna year  the dividend yield for both Valero and Phillips 66 has been higher than the broader sector  While the sector depicted yield of 2 6   Valero returned almost 3   Phillips 66 has a dividend yield of 2 7  Cash Flow From OperationsOver the last nine months  Phillips 66 reported a sharp year over year decline in cash flow from operating activities  which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firms  Valero s figure was unchanged  Valero generated enough cash to fund capital payment Phillips 66 generated operating cash flow of  1717 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared with  2296 million reported in the corresponding period of 2016  Valero generated cash flow from operations of  3822 million  unchanged from the corresponding period of 2016 Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Valero has an edge over Phillips 66 considering price performance  valuation  liquidity  dividend yield   Phillips 66 scores on long term projections and earnings surprise history  On overall comparison  the scale is slightly tilted in favor of Valero However  we prefer to be on the sidelines and ask investors to hold the stocks for now  reflected by the companies  Zacks Rank A few better ranked stocks in the same industry are Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO   and Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD    Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ

in crude price has strengthened the financial metrics of the energy sector   as represented by the Zacks Oil Energy sector   and helped them pay off a part of their huge debt The sector now has sufficient net operating cashflow to fund their capital spending  Also  the energy sector s 3 7  dividend yield is lucrative  and is more than the 1 8  yield of the S P 500   We believe that the

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Get Sweet Earnings Surprises With 5 Top StocksIt is not surprising that before an earnings season  every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation  This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high quality in nature Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company On the other hand  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher How to Find Stocks that Can Beat Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock

126619,348134,PXD,Here s Why It s Worth Investing In Pioneer Natural  PXD  Now,opinion,"On Jan 3  Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   was raised to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Why the Upgrade 
Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy  Stocks that have recently seen upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months 
Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has been revised higher from 65 cents to 72 cents  Also  for 2017  estimates were raised from  1 54 to  1 59 
Pioneer Natural has an impressive earnings surprise history  The energy giant managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the prior four quarters  the average positive surprise being 67 6   Also  we expect the company to witness year over year earnings improvement of 896 5  in 2017 and 122 9  in 2018 
Also  Pioneer Natural s balance sheet looks impressive  Total cash and equivalents as of Sep 30  2017  was recorded at nearly  2 billion  which can easily take care of the current debt of  449 million  Moreover  the company s long term debt has been steadily declining since 2016 

 
The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil recently traded at  60 74 per barrel   last touched before June 2015   per Reuters  Also  natural gas traded above the psychological mark of  3 per million British Thermal Unit  BTU   Overall  the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow 
Share price of Pioneer Natural  belonging to the Zacks Oil US Exploration   has rallied 6 2  in the last six months 

 
Other Stocks to Consider
A few other prospective stocks in the energy sector are Lonestar Resources US Inc    NASDAQ LONE    Northern Oil and Gas Inc    NYSE NOG   and Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG     All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see     
Headquartered in Fort Worth  TX  Lonestar is an upstream energy player  The company is expected to post year over year earnings growth of 81 3  in 2017 
Based in Minnetonka  MN  Northern Oil is an upstream energy player  The company s 2017 revenues are estimated to grow almost 48  
Headquartered in Houston  TX  Cabot is involved in exploration of oil and gas  The stock will likely report earnings growth of 350 8  in 2017

Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
With crude remaining under  50 a barrel  and skepticism about the recent OPEC deal running strong  investors have been fleeing the energy stocks  especially the E Ps   exploration and production   stocks 
Some have fallen 50  in 2017 and are at new 52 week lows 
A Re Test of the 2016 Lows 
If you recall  the energy stocks were beaten down in early 2016 as crude fell to new multi year lows  The energy stocks appeared set to head into the abyss 
But a turnaround in crude prices also resulted in a rally in oil stocks 
Everyone believed the rally would continue into 2017   Most analysts expected crude to trend higher in 2017 and head into the  60s  That would mean that the energy stocks were also undervalued 
They were wrong  Even with OPEC production cuts  there s still too much oil on the market as the US shale industry has ramped up production 
The number of oil rigs has nearly doubled in the last year 
But because crude has remained depressed  that means oil company earnings aren t rebounding either 
Just a reminder  a stock sell off doesn t necessarily mean the stock is cheap  Tracey dives in to find out whether these E Ps are buying opportunities or not

Investors Dump Energy Stocks
The federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks  which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR   an assortment of the largest U S  energy companies   down almost 2  Wednesday 
The two energy representatives in the 30 stock Dow Jones industrial average  ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM   and Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   were down more than 1   Meanwhile  some of the biggest casualties of the S P 500 were Pioneer Natural Resources Co    NYSE PXD    Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO    Hess Corp    NYSE HES   and Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC   
Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories decreased by 1 66 million barrels for the week ending June 9  2017  following a jump of 3 30 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 2 million barrels  An uptick in refinery demand and lower imports led to the stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer though the withdrawal failed to match up with expectations as domestic production edged higher 
Importantly  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was down 1 16 million barrels from previous week s level to 62 22 million barrels 
While the ninth inventory reduction in 10 weeks will further help narrow the year over year storage surplus  the U S  still remains awash with excess oil  At 511 55 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 2 1  from the year ago period and are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year 
The crude supply cover was down from 29 7 days in the previous week to 29 5 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 32 6 days 
Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were up for the second straight week on weakening demand  The 2 10 million barrels addition   contrary to the polled number of 600 000 barrels fall in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 242 44 million barrels  Following last week s increase  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2 3  higher than the year earlier level and is above the upper limit of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  inched up 328 000 barrels last week  ahead of analysts  expectations for 200 000 barrels increase in supply level  The third successive weekly increase in distillate fuel stocks could be attributed to fall in exports  Despite past week s increase in distillate fuel stocks  at 151 42 million barrels  supplies remain marginally lower than the year ago level but are close to the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 0 3  from the prior week to 94 4

126757,348272,PXD,2 Smart Ways To Profit From The Permian Basin Oil And Gas Rush,opinion,"Is this the time to buy oil   gas companies 
Maybe yes  maybe no  Strong today  oil prices could might back and fill some more 
But we know we are consuming more each year and we know the Permian Basin is likely to be the best place to be 
Here are the two smartest ways to avoid the volatility of a single producer 
Is it time to buy the best energy companies  Maybe yes  maybe not  I imagine the price of oil will back and fill for a few more months  You never know  But two things we do know 
 1  America will still need more oil and gas than it did last year  which was more than the year before  and that consumption was still higher than the preceding year  and
 2  The Permian Basin of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico  which currently produces 25  of all US oil  is likely to grow that percentage and add significant natural gas production as well  The most prolific basin in the USA is the biggest beneficiary of advanced drilling technologies that didn t exist 5 years ago  We ve always known the oil and gas were there   now the techniques exist to get to them 

Apache Corp  NYSE APA  just announced a huge increase in oil reserves based upon more thorough seismic mapping of its properties  sending its stock higher by 7  in one day  The graphic above comes to us from Apache via Marketwatch  along with the in frame typo  and shows that their big discovery is in the Delaware Formation of the Permian 
The big news is that even this until now slacker area of the Permian Basin looks now as if it might become every bit as prolific as the Sprayberry and Wolfcamp formations that have seen the most successful production profiles in recent years 

As a result  most investors will simply pile in  hoping not to miss a big move from APA  EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD  or REN  REN is Resolute Energy  which is already up 800  since July 5th based upon their projections of a big find in the Permian  This has all the makings of a crowded trade and lots of disappointed late comers 
I d like to suggest two more conservative ways to play future discoveries in the Prolific Permian  One is an old favorite we have held in our managed portfolios previously and will again at the right price  The other is a current holding 
The oldie but goodie is Texas Pacific Land Trust  NYSE TPL  I originally learned about TPL from a fellow financial writer I exchange newsletters with  Bob Howard of Positive Patterns  positivepatterns gmail com   Bob and I have been amazingly close to each other s recommendations for years now and I am certainly indebted to him for TPL  Texas Pacific Land is the most successful company  trust  you have never heard of  Up 41  this year  they are actually up some 2500  since 2000  They were 7 then and are 185 today   During this same period a passive investment in an S P 500 index fund would be up less than 85   
So what does a company with these sorts of returns do  Build a social media site that counts billions of people as subscribers  Design a smartphone so cool that it creates a new category of must have devices  Create the world s biggest online superstore 
Nope  They sell  or lease  a bunch of ugly desert land  In Texas  Specifically in the west Texas area around the Permian Basin  On lands they lease  they retain oil and gas royalties and are the overall manager of the properties 
Texas Pacific Land Trust was organized in Texas on February 1  1888  It s charter is to sell itself out of existence 
It was formed as a result of the bankruptcy of the Texas Pacific Railway Company as a way of reimbursing  over time  the creditors of the defunct railroad  It employs  I believe  7 total individuals whose job it is to sell land  lease land to provide cash flow  and buy back stock to continually reduce the number of shares  This approach allows them to pay small dividends or buy out the  certificate  holders  That would be any of us who buy shares 
TPL derives income primarily from land sales  oil and gas royalties  easements  grazing leases  and interest  There are no material liens or encumbrances on the Trust s title  The Trust also owns a 1 128 nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest under 85 414 acres of land and a 1 16 nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest under 373 777 acres of land in west Texas  TPL s landholdings also include some in the path of urban development  It is a land company and  by virtue of its perpetual leases  an under the radar oil and gas company without the debt  which is zero  or risks of the explorers  Dry hole or gusher  TPL gets something  it just gets even more when there are gushers 
I would caution you against rushing out to buy shares  however  Savvy players have been bidding the stock up over the years and especially this year   It sold for  116 in January   It is also thinly traded  with just 9 000 to 10 000 shares traded on an average day  I currently have orders in at  145 and  165  but won t be chasing it at these prices  Any general market malaise or energy decline will  I believe  give me the opportunity to own shares 
My second stealth way to play success in the Permian is via a closed end fund  BlackRock Energy and Resources  NYSE BGR   It currently sells at a discount to NAV of 7 5  and yields 6 5   paid monthly  Its top holdings include the very best energy firms in existence 

The  1 landholder  well  after TPL  in the Permian Basin is Chevron  NYSE CVX   They hold some 2 million net acres   and are the 3rd biggest holding of BlackRock Energy   Resources  after only superstars Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Royal Dutch Shell B  NYSE RDSb   Number 5 among BGR s holdings is Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   OXY is second only to Chevron in the Permian  with 1 5 million acres  but it also enjoys the highest production of any company there  a whopping 255 000 BOE d  barrels of oil equivalent per day   It also counts EOG and PXD among its largest holdings 
Regular readers will note an interesting coincidence  or not   We have  in the past  owned every single one of the top 11 holdings of BGR  All are favorites of mine  Since I know I want to own them again  we may as well start now 
Yes  energy shares may decline further  If I m early in buying quality energy firms  well  I ve been early before  The last time energy stocks were forsaken  I bought  too early  and it worked out wonderfully  So I am taking an initial position in BlackRock Energy   Resources  BGR   and if it declines we ll buy more  all the while being paid 6 5  for our patience  We bought BGR last Thursday at 14 36

126762,348277,PXD,Oil Efficiencies Drive Costs Down  Renewables Threaten,opinion,"We have written often in these pages about the significance of the technological revolution that has occurred in U S  oil production since the development and widespread application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking   That revolution has disrupted global energy markets  with the flood of U S  shale oil helping further break the hold of OPEC  The sharp upswing in U S  oil production since 2006 reversed the long decline that had really only paused  not reversed  with Alaskan oil discoveries and production in the 1970s 

Source  U S  Energy Information Agency
The point we want to make today is that this technological revolution is not over  it is ongoing  and it is helping continue to drive costs lower for U S  oil producers 
This is noteworthy because fracking is becoming more complex  Last year  Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD  described the evolution of their fracking techniques 

Source  Pioneer Natural Resources Investor Presentation  May 2016
As fracking has developed  it involves more proppants  materials such as sand  which help keep open the cracks that fracking generates   more fluids  and more  and more closely spaced  fracks 
In spite of that increased complexity  technical improvements continue to drive down the cost of production 

Source  U S  Energy Information Agency
While there is a tug of war between increasing drilling complexity and rising efficiency and productivity  the latter is winning out  The U S  Energy Information Agency  EIA  recently noted 

Upstream costs in 2015 were 25  to 30  below their 2012 levels  when per well costs were at their highest point over the past decade  Changes in technology have affected drilling efficiency and completion  supporting higher productivity per well and lowering costs  while shifts towards deeper and longer lateral wells with more complex completions have tended to increase costs  The adoption of best practices and the improvement of well designs have reduced drilling and completion times  decrease total well costs  and increase well performance  Greater standardization of these drilling and completion practices and designs across the industry should continue to lower costs  The drilling cost per foot  based on total depth  and the completion cost per foot  based on lateral length  are both projected to maintain these lower cost trends through 2018 

We would suggest that the EIA is being cautious in this assessment  It is likely that increasing technical sophistication will continue to push drilling and completion costs lower for U S  frackers well past 2018 
In short  U S  shale oil producers are not a flash in the pan  and particularly with a hydrocarbon friendly administration in the White House  we believe that their disruption of the OPEC global oil cartel will be ongoing 
In a broader context  we believe that OPEC may succeed in cooperating long enough to help bring the price of oil somewhat closer to the levels they need to support social spending  and in some cases  stave off the risk of rebellion by an angry populace   When they do  it will only encourage U S  producers further  as they will constantly be refining and improving their technology and decreasing their costs 
In addition  as we have written before  hanging over both U S  and non U S  hydrocarbon producers  we see a  Sword of Damocles   Frackers are not the only ones improving their technology  Renewables continue to gain ground  with renewable electricity generators approaching grid parity without subsidies  and battery technology and production both nearing inflection points  Together  these points make us bearish on long term prospects for oil 
Investment implications  U S  oil producers  costs continue to fall  even in the face of more complex and demanding drilling techniques  We believe these efficiencies will keep improving  and even if OPEC and its allies manage to edge the price of oil higher  U S  technical innovation will continue to challenge and disrupt global markets  Add in the ever present specter of rapidly improving renewable technologies  and you have a mixture that is favorable for energy prices in the short term  because of the current economic backdrop of business expansion which promises increasing demand for hydrocarbons  However  after the current demand increases have flowed through the system  we are not bullish on oil prices in the long term ",2017-03-03,Tim Shirata,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/efficiencies-keep-driving-costs-down,-while-renewables-threaten-further-200177649",200177649

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

5 Oil Stocks Earnings Set to Double in Q1

	The first quarter of 2017 is over  and now is the time to start preparing for the upcoming earnings releases  The most notable development in the January March quarter of this year is the improved crude pricing scenario compared with first quarter 2016  Given that crude is the primarily determinant of the fate of all energy stocks  this is undoubtedly favorable for most companies belonging to the Energy sector 

	Additionally  we expect significant margin improvement  on a year over year basis  for the Oil Energy sector during the first quarter  Given these positives we have picked certain oil stocks that are likely post stellar first quarter 2017 earnings  That s not all  These stocks also have the potential for solid earnings growth in the long run  Let s delve deeper to find out how 

Oil Price Shows Improvement 

	WTI crude price has displayed significant improvement in first quarter 2017  on a year over year basis  In fact  we noted substantial increase in average oil prices in the first two months this year 

	According to data is provided by   EIA   the average WTI crude price in January and February was  52 50 and  53 47 per barrel  respectively  compared with  31 68 and  30 32 per barrel a year ago 

	This massive improvement in commodity price from the mid Feb 2016 multi year low level of  26 21 per barrel came on the back of OPEC s historical production cut agreement signed on Nov 30  2016  No doubt  the deal was one of the most effective measures to recover oil prices amid plentiful supply of the commodity  However  Mar 2017 showed a comparatively bearish trend in oil prices owing to the resurgence in output by U S  shale producers 

Energy Sector to Witness Margin Expansion in Q1 

	Per our    report revenue for the Oil Energy sector is expected to improve more than 33  year over year as compared to an unimpressive 2  growth during fourth quarter 2016 

	Margins are predicted to increase 4 7  year over year compared with only 0 3  expansion during the October December quarter of 2016  Most importantly  when 11 Zacks sectors belonging to the S P 500 index showed a decline in margin growth for first quarter 2017  positive anticipated growth for the Oil Energy sector turns out impressive  Also  the sector s margin growth is predicted to be the highest among all the 16 Zacks sectors defining the S P 500 index

126783,348298,PXD,What To Expect From Hercules Offshore s  HEROQ  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Oil and gas drilling contractor Hercules Offshore Inc   is expected to release its second quarter 2016 results on Thursday  July 28 
In the preceding three month period  the Houston  TX based offshore specialist delivered a positive earnings surprise of 35 71  despite the challenges that a steep drop in oil price tagged along  This was primarily owing to strong cost control measures 
As far as the earnings surprise history is concerned  the company has a mixed record  its beaten estimates in 2 of the last four quarters with an average beat of 16 87  HERCULES OFFSHR Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Unlike the previous few quarters  second quarter 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with crude advancing more than 26  sequentially    the best quarterly percentage gain in seven years  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures during the Apr Jun 2016 period hovered mostly between  40 and  50 per barrel 
Therefore  producers are likely to revive spending on drilling activities that would spur rig count  This  in turn  will result in improved demand for oilfield equipments  thereby driving Hercules Offshore s revenues  earnings and cash flow 
Moreover  to a large extent  Hercules Offshore s successful cost reduction initiatives are expected to cushion the results 
However  despite oil s massive recovery since February  it s still under  50   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  In particular  deepwater ultra deepwater drilling   with its associated risks and steep costs   require a far higher oil price than what is prevailing currently   As a result  the struggling Hercules Offshore   that filed for bankruptcy last month for the second time   is expected to bear the brunt of narrow margins and a competitive price environment 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hercules Offshore will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at a loss of  2 06 
Zacks Rank  Hercules Offshore has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

However  there are signs of weakness in the refining business  suggesting that the unit   which had saved Royal Dutch Shell when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  With the cost of gasoline  heating oil  and other refined products catching up on the beaten down crude price  crack spreads  or refining margins  are under pressure  This is expected to impact Shell s near term downstream profitability  Burgeoning supplies of gasoline  the most widely used petroleum product  and the resulting low prices are also a cause for concern

As such  these are better suited for the new requirements of the exploration business and  therefore  command higher dayrates and utilization than rigs from other land drillers  In fact  the company projected a slight improvement in average rig margin per day It is to be noted that through the quarter  oil price improved significantly from mid February when West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude fell to a 12 year low mark of  26 05 per barrel  Moreover  last month  oil prices settled above the psychologically important  50 per barrel level for the first time in more than 10 months Since Helmerich   Payne s business is positively correlated to crude prices  an improving black gold should come as a blessing for the company  HELMERICH PAYNE Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Pioneer Natural Resources is an independent exploration and production enterprise  The company researches  develops and produces oil and gas commodities in order to satisfy the global energy demand  In addition  the US group sells homogenous oil  liquefied natural gas and gas facilities 
Further activities include the acquisition of properties as well as the support of reserves in the administration  financing and management areas  This value  therefore  belongs to the gas and oil sector 
After the big uptrend was broken at approx   160 in November 2014  over time a new downtrend has developed  After the break at  160  the price fell down to  127  to then draw directly back up to  181  Then  however  the market went back down to  105  which entailed a new correction zone between  127 31 and  181 97 
The value was able to work its way back up to about  171 88 by April  where it then showed us our DowHow signals  For several days now  it has appeared to be going into a new movement  The target is clearly located at the last point two at  105 81 

Suedzucker  DE SZUG Suedzucker is one of the leading companies in the European food industry  The current Suedzucker was founded in 1926 as a merger of five sugar companies  Today  the regional sugar producer has become a leading food corporation  Along with sugar and sweetening agents  the product range comprises frozen products and further food ingredients 
Even if people always have to eat  we can see that the chart was able to recover very far from its low at  9 89  and is now located at the upper end of its currently valid correction zone  The point three is located at  22 68  the current high lies exactly one cent below  namely at  22 67 
Precisely at this point is also where our DowHow signals are appearing  showing a clear short  As you can see  I have already entered here and am anticipating a clear downward movement  However  an entry is still possible 

Union Pacific  NYSE UNP Union Pacific is a leading transport company that is primarily active in the areas of goods transportation by rail and by truck  These two core areas are lead by the sub companies Union Pacific Railroad Company and Overnite Corporation  fusion of Overnite Transportation Company and Motor Cargo Industries  
Alongside this  the group also holds shares in technology companies and insurance corporations  This means that this value is also very dependent on the general economic development  Whether we can see a forerunner of the economy in this value remains to be seen 
In any case  in the chart we can see a clear downtrend with a correction zone between  79 31 and  98 28  The current high can be found at  96  and right there is where our DowHow signals also appear once again  This is precisely why one could now speculate on a new downward movement very early already

126794,348309,PXD,U S  Fracking Now Competitive With Saudi Oil Prices,opinion,"U S  fracking operations are now efficient enough to produce oil at a price that s competitive with traditional drilling in Saudi Arabia at least for Pioneer Natural Resources   NYSE PXD    whose CEO confirmed that production costs have fallen to  2 25 a barrel in some locations 
Scott Sheffield  Pioneer s soon to be retired chief executive  said in the company s earnings call Thursday that improved techniques at horizontal wells in the Permian Basin of West Texas have brought costs low enough to match that of Saudi Arabia  which attempted to sabotage U S  operations by flooding the market with low priced oil starting in 2014 
Pioneer reported its second quarter earnings results this morning  posting a loss of 22 cents per share on revenues of  786 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate called for a loss of 34 cents per share  while our revenue estimate was  794 million 
While Pioneer s earnings beat and newly competitive pricing imply that it is possible for U S  oil companies to survive the market conditions caused by Saudi Arabia and other oil giants in the Middle East  Sheffield didn t seem to have much faith in any production outside the Permian Basin 
 My firm belief is the Permian is going to be the only driver of long term oil growth in this country  And it s going to grow on up to about 5 million barrels a day from 2 million barrels   Sheffield said 
Pioneer also said that it s in the process of introducing its third generation of well completion techniques  This  Version 3 0  uses even more sand and water to pull more oil out of the rocks  Version 2 0 wells were producing 2 000 barrels per day  and while Version 3 0 promises more productivity  Pioneer declined to say exactly what the output of the new wells is

126818,348333,PXD,Why Oil Could Be Higher For Longer ,opinion,"Last week Wood Mackenzie released a estimating that oil and gas companies will spend  1TN less on finding and developing new reserves through 2020 than was expected to be the case before the 2014 16 oil price collapse  2016 reductions in capex have been estimated at  300 400BN  but this is the first credible figure we ve seen over a longer period of time  It s likely to be followed by substantial changes in the crude oil market that will benefit U S  shale producers 
To see why this is the case  consider how the risk profile of a conventional new crude oil project has shifted  Whether it s offshore  or Canadian tar sands  these plays require substantial upfront capital investment with a payoff over many years  If it ll take you five years or more to extract and sell enough crude oil to earn an acceptable IRR  you are simply long crude oil  Exploration and production companies  E P  routinely hedge only for a couple of years out  because that s all that the liquidity of the futures market will reasonably allow  For example    NYSE PXD  shows 85  of this year s crude production hedged but only 55  of next year s  This is fairly typical 
The price  of last year  combined with the growth in U S  shale extraction and enormous cut in capex  reveals the following calculus  evaluating a new conventional project requires assessing some probability of another price collapse to  30 BBL or lower during the life of the project  Prior large drops in oil  such as in 2007 8 or 2000 coincided with a recession and were the result of a drop in economic activity  While softening global growth bore some responsibility for the most recent drop  it was largely caused by supply increasing faster than demand 
So now imagine the difference in risk assessment facing an E P company contemplating an investment in a new shale project versus a conventional one  Shale extraction is characterized by large numbers of individual wells completed relatively quickly with high and sharply declining production  Data from the  shows that the cost of drilling a single well in any of the five most prolific U S  shale regions has fallen to  6 7MM  Much has been written about declining production costs  which is why U S  crude oil production only dropped from 9 5MMBD to around 8 5MMBD even while the rig  fell by 75  2015 16  That increased efficiency includes better use of drilling rigs  so they re not needed for as long to drill a well  The corresponding fall in costs has also shortened the time to break even for shale drilling 
By contrast  in Canada the enormous upfront investment required in a tar sands project meant that production has continued to ramp up seemingly impervious to the price of oil  Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage  SAGD  involves sinking pipes into the bitumen to heat it up for extraction  Shutting down production risks the pipes freezing  causing potential damage to the facility  So Canadian operators have continued production even at prices that fail to cover their operating costs because of the risk to their huge capital investment 
The consequence of a price collapse in the future looks entirely different to these two operators  The U S  shale operator is nimble and can rely on hedging production because high initial production rates mean more oil is produced sooner  But the shale operator also knows he can respond to lower crude prices by stopping drilling  He has a short response time 
The tar sands operator has to make a long term forecast on crude oil that cannot be hedged  He has no way to mitigate his exposure to prices years out  and his scenario analysis now has to incorporate some possibility of a repeat of 2014 16  Moreover  the existence of shale oil production raises the risk of a future temporary collapse  precisely because the E P companies whose collective activity might cause it can so easily respond and protect themselves 
The swing producer is not the lowest cost producer  but rather the producer whose time to break even is shortest  The risk of a future big drop in oil is why  1TN in capex has been cut  The market has changed  and it favors the nimble producer who can exploit temporarily high prices and then drop back when prices do  We may have a permanently higher crude oil price over the long run  precisely because the risk of ruin dissuades the big projects whose supply would lower prices  Canada may never see another new tar sands project  The outlook for U S  shale  with its constantly improving technology  falling break evens and short time required to recover capital invested  looks very bright indeed ",2016-06-20,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-oil-could-be-higher-for-longer-200136834,200136834

126829,348344,PXD,A Closer Look At U S  Sector PEs  Forward PEs And PEG Ratios,opinion,"What the economic calendar lacked in volume  it made up for with importance  this past week  two important coincident indicators reported positive results  Industrial production rose for the 3rd time in 6 months  this time by  6   Better still  the previous decline of  4  was revised to an increase of  2   All major industry groups contributed to the rise  manufacturing increased  4   although it dropped 1  annually   mining was up  2   it s second consecutive rise  and utility output rose 2 4   The retail sector provided additional good news  sales rose  6  M M  Like the industrial production report  activity increase in a number of sub categories 
The Atlanta Fed s GDP now forecast projects 2nd quarter growth of 2 4  while the NY Fed s GDP  Nowcast  predicts 2 2   making their average a moderate 2 3  pace 
Economic Conclusion  Industrial production and retail sales are coincident indicators used by the NBER to date recessions  Industrial production declined for the last 15 months due to oil s price collapse and the strong dollar  While two consecutive increases isn t necessarily a forerunner of continuing improvement  it is  at minimum  a potential sign that the industrial recession is over  especially when considered with the recent series of positive PMI readings  Retail sales weren t declining like industrial production  but they were stagnant from July 2015 through March 2016  moving sideways in the latter half of 2015 and engaging in a  two steps forward  one step back  pattern for the first quarter of 2016  But they ve made strong gains in the last three months  reaching post recession highs in the latest report 
Market Overview  For the last 12 18 months  I ve been slightly bearish thanks to the combination of an expensive market and declining earnings  Today  I want to discuss the market s expensive price  but from a different perspective 
Rather than look at the overall market s valuation  I ll look at the PE  forward PE and PEG ratio of the 10 largest holdings of the three sectors that have performed the best since start of the year  utilities  Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU   up 16 28    energy  Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE   up  10 59    basic material   Materials Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLB  up  7 54    The tables are from the FINVIZ website 
Utilities 

Notice the extreme overvaluation  caused by investors reaching for yield and safety  Only three of the largest holdings Exelon Corporation  NYSE EXC   Public Service Enterprise Group  NYSE PEG  and  PPL Corporation  NYSE PPL  have a PE below 20  While the forward PEs are slightly better the PEGs are through the roof  indicating that none of these securities is a bargain 
Energy 

Four of the largest holdings have no PE EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG   Occidental Petroleum Corporation  NYSE OXY   Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   Only three of these stocks have a forward PE below 21 Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  and Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   and the PEG ratios are either expensive or non existent

Only three of the XLB s largest holdings have a PE below 20 LyondellBasell Industries NV  NYSE LYB   Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW  and International Paper Company  NYSE IP   only two have a PEG below two  LYB and DOW

Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Pioneer Natural is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  19 44   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 29 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a wider loss of 36 cents  This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise Zacks Rank  Pioneer Natural carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which when combined with a positive Earnings ESP  makes us confident about an earnings beat

126869,348384,PXD,Do Rig Counts Matter These Days ,opinion,"Focusing on rig counts to try to determine the velocity of future oil production is a fool s pursuit 
Sure  they re a good measure during boom times  But during busts  seasoned investors know that only looking at the  doesn t give them the whole picture 
Just check out the most current numbers from the oil and gas patch  Rig counts are down for both  The number of oil rigs has dropped more than 30  in the past six months  Natural gas rig numbers have dropped by more than 70  in the past decade 
Yet the United States is producing more oil and more natural gas than at any other time in the past four decades 
Rig counts still matter  but they re a poor indicator of future production  Here are three key indicators you should use instead 
Future Production Indicator  1  Location  This isn t just important when looking for a house or starting up a retail business  Shale production in the United States has a specific location profile  as well 
The most prolific oil and gas shale production regions in the country are located in seven locations 
The Bakken in North Dakota
The Eagle Ford in Texas
Haynesville in Texas and Louisiana
The Marcellus Shale region  stretching from West Virginia to New York
The Permian Basin in Texas and Oklahoma
Utica in Ohio
The Niobrara Formation in Northeastern Colorado and parts of Wyoming  Nebraska  and Kansas
These plays produce more oil and gas with lower rig usage than other shale production locations 
Future Production Indicator  2  Technology  On top of location  technology and efficiency have come a long way in the past few years  further throwing off the meaning of rig counts 
Companies like Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD  are using more sand in their fracking process and extracting up to 30  more oil from their wells  as a result 
Producers who espouse better technology will also use fewer rigs during down times  focusing instead on producing more oil per completed well 
Future Production Indicator  3  Well Completions  Perhaps the most important number to focus on during a slump is the rate of completions 
While certain companies are locked into contracts that are forcing them to drill a certain number of wells  others   like EOG Resources  NYSE EOG    are delaying completions of  
Why  Well  by delaying completions  companies can defer cost outlays and take advantage of possible higher prices in the future  Conventional wells use up capital on the front end for drilling and pumping  Shale plays  on the other hand  use up greater capital when the wells are actually fractured because materials must be purchased for the fracturing process 
Thus  delaying completions are a real and significant option during tough times 
The problem is  these delays also create a slowdown in future production 
Keep Your Focus
As investors  your focus should remain squarely on companies like EOG  Pioneer  and larger  better capitalized plays  These companies will be able to shift production  or delay it outright  until the markets improve 
When considering the macro oil production picture  investors should focus on well completions and completion rates  Let the less informed talking heads on television and the like focus on things like rig counts alone 
And the chase continues ",2015-04-02,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/do-rig-counts-matter-these-days-247138,247138
126870,348385,PXD,Dealing With The Market  Go With the Flow,opinion,"Everything flows and nothing abides  everything gives way and nothing stays fixed  Heraclitus
 Go with the flow    Deal with it    It is what it is   These kinds of vague philosophical exhortations merely simplify the long held idea to try and handle  as best as one can  the various issues which seem to spring up in every day life  As an investor in capital markets  and specifically  the equity area  it seems there are always situations which somehow will affect your portfolio  At the very least  they cause fluctuations in the price of your holdings  Even worse  sometimes they can potentially cause the market value of specific assets to drop vastly under the price which might even closely resemble fair  or intrinsic value  Of course  these events could conclude one to believe they represent a tremendous opportunity 
Within the context of an environment which continually brings us new information  the past week was no different  The most prominent change affecting asset prices was the wild fluctuations in global bond markets  Off of a low set maybe two weeks ago  bond yields in Europe  specifically Germany  jumped dramatically higher  Joining the parade were U S  treasuries  which saw their 10 Year yield hit 2 30  at one point  Understand  asset prices are supposed to fluctuate  and we all know that is constant  However  the large spike in Germany  from  07 in yield to nearly  80 at the high  ending at  54 for the week   represent large losses for those who are long the credit  Reversing the position  interestingly enough  and you get a nice sized gain  Thank you very much says Mr  Gross  who if you remember  commented on the attractiveness of this situation a few moments ago 
Still  for equity owners  all week long you were managing the byproduct of those who used negative yielding European bonds as their funding vehicle in a carry trade  and then watching them unwind it when they went sour  Lovely  Particularly affected were small cap stocks as nearly everything we owned in that area was hit  and pretty hard  Which is why we get back to our topic of the week  the very complex idea of  dealing with it  
You see  when you invest in equities  you have to be able to ignore these kinds of currents  or background noise if you will  to focus on what counts  In this light  when you look at company earnings reports  you have to compare results with what you expect  Specifically  one company which we have held for three years now came out and pushed back their cash flow projections for yet another year  Bond yields had nothing to do with this  and now I am forced to make a critical decision  Keep owning it  Sell  Do nothing  I don t want to keep you up late at night worrying about what I did  it might affect your sleep patterns  so let s just say the correct answer rhymes with  Oh  Hell   Just a little more color  though  it wasn t a big position  so you won t have to take any melatonin 
In all seriousness  it does highlight what I consider a very important part of investing  It is evaluating the capital allocation decisions of your holdings to see if performance is matching your expectations  All companies go through different stages in their life cycles  Larger entities find it much more difficult to grow at higher rates  but because of their size  if capital allocation decisions don t show immediate results  they can handle the repercussions more easily  With smaller entities  the spending decisions are far more critical  Last year a holding of ours saw a net cash position of nearly 100 million dollars get obliterated because of terrible decisions by the newly hired CEO  In the case of our three year holding  there also was nearly 50 million of cash on the balance sheet  with no debt  Yet  I was not willing to wait another year for better performance  We are no different than anyone else as there are always constraints on time and money available  With plenty of other holdings and possibilities that offer opportunity  we went with the flow 
Last week was also interesting because there were lots of profile investment gatherings  Here in Las Vegas at the SALT Conference  Dan Loeb made news by essentially calling Warren Buffett a hypocrite  His audience agreed and applauded wildly  Mr  Loeb  what a charmer  making friends everywhere he goes  In New York  at the Ira Sohn Conference  which actually donates the proceeds to research for pediatric cancer   David Einhorn ingeniously gave a new nickname to the shale industry   Motherfrackers   He also proceeded to name one of the industries most high profile and successful companies as a top short  Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD   Bill Ackman presented as well  and he compared Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  to Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   Something about the Buffett guy which keeps people thinking about him  wouldn t you say 
Janet Yellen also got in on the act by showing off her stock evaluation prowess  She mentioned equities as a potentially problematic area because of their high valuations  and wouldn t you know it  the market sold off that day  Thanks so much  Mrs  Yellen  Alibaba  NYSE BABA  reported strong results and its stock got off the deck a bit  as did it s biggest cheerleader  Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO   NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  had a decent earnings report but announced it is selling its wireless base division and investors were not happy  Liberty Media  NASDAQ LMCA  also reported on Friday and showed pretty much what everyone knew  great businesses and leadership  but like everyone else  they are dealing with a strong dollar and various headwinds in their different holdings

126872,348387,PXD,Will Frackers Pull A  Lehman Brothers  ,opinion,"In November 2007  the relatively unknown hedge fund manager David Einhorn raised major concerns about the accounting at Lehman Brothers  It led him to bet against the company and short the stock 
No one paid much attention  until Lehman Brothers collapsed 
Einhorn s reputation was made  and his firm    Greenlight Capital    became one of the hedge funds to watch 
Now  Einhorn has found another prominent target  the frackers  U S  based oil exploration and production  E P  companies 
Zeroing In
Einhorn called much of the industry  frack addicts  who were wasting money on wells that ll never pay off 
He said some companies are currently getting a negative return on their invested capital  And that  in some cases  was true even when oil was trading at  100 per barrel 
Einhorn added   When someone doesn t want you to look at traditional  financial  metrics  it is a good time to look at traditional metrics   By  someone   he means exploration and production companies 
Einhorn dislikes how these firms report their earnings through methods like EBITDAX  which means earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and exploration expenses  He said this measure  stands for earnings before a lot of stuff  
In particular  Einhorn targeted five companies  Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD   EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Continental Resources  NYSE CLR   Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL  and Concho Resources  NYSE CXO  
Pioneer seems to be his No  1 target  since he dubbed it  the motherfracker  
 A business that burns cash and doesn t grow isn t worth anything   said Einhorn about Pioneer 
Instead  Einhorn encouraged investors to focus on cash as a guide to the health of the industry 
Since 2006  the U S  oil exploration and production industry has spent  80 billion more in capital than it made selling oil  Einhorn says companies were only kept alive by the constant inflows of capital from bankers  also known as loans  and investors alike 
David Einhorn is a well known poker player   He won  4 4 million at the 2012 World Series of Poker tournament   But is he bluffing here 
On the Money  Sort Of
There is no denying the massive cash burn of these E P companies  Many of them have debt problems  which I ve noted before 
Moody s said its LSI  Liquidity Stress Index  for these companies more than doubled in March to 9 8  from 4 4   But keep in mind  this Index hit 26  in March 2009 when oil prices plunged due to the financial crisis 
And the group as a whole is making progress  The forecast is for these companies to be at a cash flow break even point in 2015  thanks to cuts in capital expenditures 
For example  Pioneer says that  by the end of 2015  costs for drilling and completing a well will be 20  lower than just a year ago 
In addition  that  80 billion Einhorn mentioned didn t just disappear  It went toward buying assets that will provide oil sometime in the future 
The Verdict on Einhorn
What is the bottom line here 
The sector is long overdue for a shakeout  Many companies  weaknesses were masked when oil was at  100  but now  there s nowhere to hide 
The best analogy for this situation was made by Ed Crooks of the Financial Times 
He compares it not to the Lehman debacle  but to the dot com boom  He says the technological progress being made in shale development is real  as it was in the dot com era  That is why drilling and completion costs for wells are falling every year 
But not all companies will survive 
Investors need to do their due diligence to separate the wheat from the chaff 
Crooks said the low cost shale producers may turn out like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   But the high cost producers may go the way of Pets com 
And the chase continues

126874,348389,PXD,Oil And Debt Continue To Flow For U S  Shale,opinion,"The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  met on June 5  and it s clear that the current trends in the global oil market will remain steady 
First  OPEC   led by Saudi Arabia   will   The cartel s production target of 30 million barrels  with an excess of 31 million barrels actually being pumped  remains 
OPEC did say they would be open to reducing their quota  but only if Russia  the world s largest producer  cuts back 
Fat chance of that  Russia has never agreed to production cuts  and isn t showing any flexibility now 
U S  shale oil producers are also continuing to pump out oil with no sign of stopping  In fact  they stand at the ready to add even more output 
Over the spring  this strategy separated the weak from the strong as supply flourished and prices dropped 
These days  the companies that survived  like EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD   have already given strong indications that they ll pump more oil if prices hold around  60 per barrel 
Tom Pugh  a Commodities Economist at Capital Economics  told The Wall Street Journal that  U S  supply could quickly rebound in response to the recent recovery in prices  
Yes  shale firms will be able to turn the taps on again thanks to the seemingly unending flow of capital from Wall Street   banks  institutional investors  and private equity are all lending 
But  another word for at least some of this capital is debt  which may soon catch up with the domestic shale oil producers 
Geyser of Debt
You see  many of these shale companies expanded thanks to debt and  to date  have yet to be disciplined by marketplace forces thanks to more debt and oil price hedges that will soon expire 
Credit analysts at UBS say there are  1 2 trillion outstanding in loans to the U S  oil industry  A third of this debt is owed by exploration and production companies  And UBS predicts the default rate on these loans could end up being in the low teens 
The latest survey of bank loan officers by the Federal Reserve found there is a higher expectation that shale firms will have trouble meeting the terms of the loans  The survey also found that banks were cutting credit lines to energy companies and asking shale firms for more collateral 
Fitch  a credit rating agency  said actual defaults should have begun happening nine to 12 months after oil prices started to fall 
But  judging by the stock performances of most of the companies involved  everything is great 
Why has nothing happened yet 
The answer is hedges  Many shale oil firms hedged their production this year 
Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK   for example  will have  1 2 billion added to its cash flow this year thanks to hedges on its production 
But this protection declines and even disappears entirely in 2016 for some companies  leaving them wide open to finally be hurt by low oil and gas prices 
Plus  companies can t add any more hedges at this late date because  in most cases  it would be too costly 
Maybe that s why  as vulnerable  such as EOG and Pioneer  are so anxious to increase their production as soon as possible  They need to generate cash 
Making the Best of What s Left
The growing flows of oil from OPEC and the United States likely mean that prices are capped in the  60 to  65 range for the foreseeable future 
Prominent voices like the Energy Minister of Russia  Alexander Novak  and the head of BP  LONDON BP   Bob Dudley  have both said as much 
Even OPEC said that oil will remain below  100 per barrel for the next decade  and may again be as low as  40 per barrel at some point in the next 10 years 
That s not good news for some shale producers 
When the capital dries up and companies are left with low prices  many will disappear a la the tech and telecom bust at the turn of the century 
But the survivors will emerge even stronger 
The lesson here is to check out the debt levels and cash flows of any shale company before investing 
And the chase continues

126886,348401,PXD,Holmes and Hicks  Diversification Is Key To Energy Value,opinion,Calling the energy space underowned and a great value  Frank Holmes and Brian Hicks of U S  Global Investors view shale oil plays as integral to an energy renaissance  Still  to hedge their bets  the two experts recommend diversification across the entire natural resources sector  including agriculture and food  In this interview with The Energy Report  they list opportunities in upstream oil and gas production  refining stocks  master limited partnerships and potash   The Energy Report  Frank  you wrote a contrarian manifesto of sorts at the beginning of May titled  A Case for Owning Commodities When No One Else Is   It showed that energy is the most underowned class by a long shot  That situation was last seen at the end of 2008  just before a major rally in natural resource stocks  Is history repeating itself Frank Holmes  To a certain degree  yes  The big difference is that America  thanks to the new introduction of fracking technology  is in a different position than the rest of the world  This is positive for America s trade deficits and its costs of manufacturing   The population of the rest of the world continues to grow  China and India account for about 40  of the world s population growth  Both countries import energy  There is not enough water in China for it to benefit from fracking   Brian Hicks  Water is a very large constraint in fracking  along with other geologic factors  Over the last several years  the game changer has been the development of shale plays here in the U S  We now import less oil than China because of the amount of shale oil we have   FH  The U S  has had huge success in drilling and exploring for natural gas  followed by all this gas coming onstream  The inverse of that was when drilling rigs slowed down because gas prices were falling  The rig count went to an all time low   People do not realize that looking for energy is like being a gerbil on a wheel you have to drill continuously to replace production  When drilling slowed down to a fraction of what it had been  gas prices went up  What are they now  Brian   BH  They fell as low as  1 thousand cubic feet   1 Mcf   Now we are in the  4 Mcf range  We had a clear overshoot to the downside  Now we are back to a more normal level   We are in the shoulder months for natural gas  If we see a warm summer  the gas price could easily approach  5 Mcf  Right now  people are in a wait and see mode   The natural gas market looks constructive  There is more commercial usage  The rig count is down  If we start to see more demand on the horizon  natural gas prices could go back to  5 Mcf pretty quickly   TER  Do you agree with the Porter Stansberrys of the world  who say the U S  will be a gas exporter within the next few years  or do you lean toward the Bill Powers  school of thought  that wells will be decimated a lot faster than anticipated and there is no supply glut   BH  I do not think we have a supply glut  We have had a severe oversupply for the last few years  but that has started to change  The change is reflected in rebounding equity prices and a more normal price range for natural gas  In terms of government policy  natural gas is considered a winner  with coal losing market share   Very few North American plays are economic at a price below  4 Mcf  To incentivize more capital investment in natural gas drilling and build a stronger rig count  we need to see prices sustained above  4  closer to  4 50 5  If gas falls below  4 Mcf and stays in that range  the rig count will continue to erode and supply will diminish   This year s somewhat longer winter shored up the overall inventory picture  which is more or less back to normal  If we have typical summer weather  we could enter the heating season with inventories slightly below average   The new wells being drilled the shale natural gas plays come on at very high rates and decline very quickly  For some plays  questions remain as to where their flow rates will bottom out  Despite the strong supply response of this new technology  there are still question marks as to what the normalized rates will be   TER  Almost 19  of your Global Resources Fund is in energy stocks  9 98  in oil and gas and 8 8  in energy infrastructure  Which is the biggest growth area  exploration  production  transportation or services   BH  We have seen a pretty good lift in upstream oil and gas producers here in the U S  Internationally  a number of stocks are trading at compelling valuations that could go higher  On the service side  we have seen a good bounce year to date   Refining stocks is an area we see as an inverse derivative play of new production in shale oil plays  The refiners are the beneficiaries of all of the crude coming on line  They can source cheaper feedstock and produce refined diesel product at lower costs than their global peers  The U S  is exporting large quantities of refined product  The margins of refining companies have expanded  and they are generating a lot of free cash  paying dividends and buying back stock  Thematically  we have enjoyed the refining space at the larger cap level because of that competitive advantage   We also see that competitive advantage reflected in chemicals  another source of strength  Even more broadly  this energy renaissance is helping lower manufacturing costs  It has benefited the overall U S  economy   More upside potential remains in services  If the North American rig count expands  I think pressure pumping and drilling stocks will improve  We have invested for a number of years in an offshore theme  infrastructure  supply  manufacturing  A lot of capital is being spent in the offshore space off Brazil and in the Gulf of Mexico  That is another area that looks compelling   TER  What are some examples of stocks in your portfolio that have done well in each of those areas   BH  Starting in the refining space  HollyFrontier Corp   HFC  had a very good 2012  as did Marathon Petroleum Corp   MPC   Both benefited from strong midcontinent refining margins   In upstream oil and gas production  we own Pioneer Natural Resources Co   PXD   which has a lot of opportunities in the Permian Basin  It expanded its overall resource by doing some lateral drilling  and is seeing big success there   In the services area  I mentioned the offshore theme  Hornbeck Offshore Services  HOS  has started to gain traction with increased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico  It is an offshore supply boat company  You are starting to see significant earnings power generated in the Gulf of Mexico because of increased day rates and more activity after the Macondo oil spill   TER  You have four master limited partnerships  MLPs  in your fund  What role do they play in balancing your risk exposure   BH  Our energy infrastructure allocation comprises mostly MLPs  You might think of higher dividend paying  higher yielding stocks as lower growth  but that is not the case with these MLPs   The expansion of the U S  crude oil supply has prompted a massive need for pipeline infrastructure  In the South Texas Eagle Ford shale play  we see tangible signs of pipeline takeaway infrastructure  We like investments that pay us a dividend every quarter some between 5 7  and that are growing at double digit rates because of the build out taking place in MLPs  We think that could continue for some time   With MLPs  you get the added benefit of a strong inflation adjusted yield that will increase along with prices for the underlying commodity  and at a faster rate than consumer price index inflation   TER  What are some of the best performers in the MLP space   BH  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L P   KMP  has been a strong performer for us  We have owned Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA   but sold that after a big move   Enterprise Products Partners L P   EPD  is a major name in the space  Williams Partners L P   WPZ  has done well for us also   TER  You also invest in fertilizer  in the form of potash  Why are you bullish on agriculture  What is the best way to invest in that space   BH  We are very bullish on agriculture and food from a long term  thematic standpoint   The overall theme is rising income levels in emerging markets  which increases demand for protein  whether from cattle or chicken  More protein requires more feed  so you can see demand for corn strengthening  Global population growth and per capita income growth are also driving the demand for more food   We have chosen to play that in two ways with companies that package and produce food and protein  such as Tyson Foods Inc   TSN  and Smithfield Foods Inc   SFD    You also have the fertilizer stocks such as PotashCorp   POT   CF Industries Holdings Inc   CF   which produces nitrogen  also used in fertilizer  and The Mosaic Co   MOS   Those stocks have done very well over the years  and should continue to do well given the macro theme   TER  Is that your advice for contrarians looking to profit in the energy sector diversification   BH  This is an unprecedented time with respect to macro policy  considering the economic conditions in Europe  the expansion of the money supply in the developing world and central banks increasing their balance sheets  There are lots of crosscurrents  We have chosen to negotiate those crosscurrents by being diversified  Our resources fund is balanced across the spectrum of natural resources   Within the energy sector  we have an allocation in all segments of the energy value train  refining  MLPs  upstream oil and gas production  domestic and international stocks  Having our hand in all of these areas helps us navigate volatility and capitalize on mispriced stocks wherever we find them   We try not to make large  concentrated bets in any one particular area  This strategy makes sense whether you are an institutional investor or an individual investor  We look for sustainable  long term themes companies that can generate cash flow in bullish commodity environments or in a commodity environment that is not quite so bullish  In other words  we look for lower cost producers with solid management teams   TER  Frank and Brian  thank you for your time and your insights   FH  Thank you   BH  It s been a pleasure

126888,348403,PXD,4 Commodity Resources Ready To Rumble,opinion,"Commodity returns vary wildly  as experienced resource investors can attest and our popular  illustrates  This inherent volatility can spell opportunity for the nimble investor who can look past the mainstream headlines to identify hot spots 
Our global resources expert  Brian Hicks  CFA  identified four areas that we believe are revved up for a resources boom  1  Plenty in the Tank for Energy Stocks Because of the previously low expectations of global growth and oil demand  energy stocks have been shunned by investors and have languished in recent years  In fact  according to Goldman Sachs  oil equities held in the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF have underperformed the broader market by 32 percent since 2008 Global energy stocks have also suffered  In a comparison of the price to book valuations of the MSCI World Energy Index to that of the MSCI World Index  the ratio is at a level we haven t seen since the late 1990s and early 2000s  Back then  crude oil plummeted to a very low price of  10 per barrel  Today  with oil hovering around  100 a barrel and improved economic conditions in the U S   energy stocks appear to be a tremendous bargain compared to overall stocks   When it comes to natural gas  the cold  snowy winter has caused inventories of the commodity to rapidly decline  As the U S  is experiencing the coldest winter in 13 years   some parts of the country have had the coldest weather in nearly three decades   natural gas inventories have been drawn down to levels we haven t seen in 10 years  Still  Old Man Winter hasn t been persuasive enough for companies to respond with supply  Based on data from the research firm IHS  384 gas directed rigs were online in the lower 48 states to refill storage and meet new demand coming online from the industrial sector in 2013  However  looking ahead over the next few years  the rig count is going to have to rise dramatically  as the gas market tightens in late 2014 and 2015   which is a tremendous opportunity for investors  says IHS  Before rig counts can increase  higher natural gas prices are needed to incentivize operators to invest in natural gas  Based on last quarter s earnings reports  many major producers  such as EOG Resources Inc   NYSE EOG   Southwestern Energy Company  NYSE SWN  or Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD   are not planning on increasing their natural gas budgets  Bill Thomas  Chairman and CEO of EOG Resources  explained his reasoning that is part of the collective thought process across the industry  For the sixth year in a row we are not  trying to  grow EOG s North American natural gas production  This is reflective of our view of low returns on natural gas investments  We won t drill any dry gas wells in North America during 2014 because we don t see a change in the gas oversupply picture until the 2017 2018 time frame As we come out of this winter season  the complacency toward adding to rig counts may amplify the deficit in natural gas inventories  2  U S  Chemical Industry Has a Competitive Edge One upside to the low natural gas prices in North America is that it equates to relatively cheap feed stock for U S  chemical companies  Whether it s Asia or Europe  gas prices outside of the U S  tend to be benchmarked to the higher price of crude oil  Along with the global economic recovery  natural gas is giving the U S  a competitive advantage  We re seeing chemical companies coming back to the states  creating jobs  expanding exports out of the U S   and helping the nation s current account deficit   3  Shipping Companies at a Possible Inflection Point The prices to ship commodities around the world have been hovering around the lowest we ve seen in five years  However  demand for shipping is starting to overtake the supply of new ships  which bodes well for shipping companies  Take a look at the chart showing the Baltic Dry Index over the past five years  The index is made up of various sizes of carriers including the Baltic Capesize  Panamax  Handysize and Supramax indices and measures the price of moving raw materials by sea  Primarily  these vessels transport iron ore and grains  i e   wheat  corn and soybeans  which are especially vital goods for China  To keep its population of 1 3 billion fed  China needs to import millions of tonnes of wheat  corn  rice and soybeans  As this demand is recognized  shipping companies should benefit  4  Alternative Energy Could Get You More Green In China  residents have been dealing with increasing cancer causing pollutants and vehicle congestion on roads  and public discontent is rising  This winter  as pollution grew to be 10 times higher than the acceptable rate  Beijing University students protested the conditions by putting masks on iconic statues  The effect that pollution is having on China s economy benefits certain industries  including renewable energy or clean energy  whether it s solar or wind power You can see just how dramatic the investment has been over the last five years  Specifically  wind power and solar look especially attractive  Take a look at CLSA data  In 2009  the country had about 0 2 percent of the global market  By 2014  it s estimated to grow to one third of the global market  China isn t the only country with a growing renewable energy market  With the Fukushima nuclear reactors incident after the massive earthquake in Japan  the solar market is taking off there too The Diverse Approach of the Global Resources Fund  PSPFX   We believe these areas of the market offer the most exciting opportunities today  They have the wind at their back  giving us the confidence to overweight the companies within these areas of the market that are also showing extremely robust fundamentals  Because of the diversity and volatility of each commodity  we believe investors benefit by holding a diversified selection of commodity stocks actively managed by professionals who understand these specialized assets and the global trends affecting them  I just flew back from Asia  where I spoke at Robert Friedland s Asia Mining Club and Mines and Money Hong Kong  with a special stop in Carslbad  CA on my way home to speak at the Investment U Conference  It

126889,348404,PXD,Lift Oil Export Ban  Free Domestic Profits And Defeat Russia,opinion,"Oppenheimer   Co  Managing Director and Senior Energy Analyst Fadel Gheit knows how to thwart Russia s aggressive tendencies and encourage domestic oil and gas production  Lift the ban on oil exports  In the absence of a strategic U S  energy policy  some companies will do better than others  In this interview with The Energy Report  conducted during earnings season  Gheit shares some of his insights on which companies have catalysts with bottom line impacts 
The Energy Report   We recently interviewed Matt Badiali and he talked about what a boon the conflict in Ukraine has been for U S  refineries  Are you seeing the same effect  What about opportunities in Europe as countries try to diversify away from dependence on Russian oil and gas 
Fadel Gheit  U S  refiners benefit from the wide Brent WTI discount  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has increased global tension  boosted Brent prices and widened the differential  With this cost advantage  U S  refiners are able to significantly increase refined product exports  mainly to Latin America and Europe  which tightened U S  supplies and boosted margins  despite flat demand 
Unfortunately  the U S  does not have an energy policy  and we still have a ban on exporting crude oil  which has been in effect for 40 years  Even with the Russian invasion  we seem paralyzed  confused and unable to respond to Russia s aggression  Lifting the export ban and supplying Europe with oil and refined products would reduce dependence on Russian oil and lower global oil prices  which in turn would hurt Russian exports and boost the economies of the U S  and Europe 
TER  In your last   you talked about the impact of instability in the Middle East on companies like Apache Corp   NYSE APA   Do you see the situation stabilizing there  Are you more comfortable with companies operating in Egypt and Turkey 
FG  I believe the Middle East will remain volatile and unstable not an attractive business environment  Apache sold 30  of its interests in Egypt to Sinopec  which is a step in the right direction  The sooner Apache exits Egypt and uses the proceeds to buy back stock  reduce debt and increase investment onshore in the U S   the better off the shareholders will be  Why invest in Egypt or Turkey when you have the huge energy resources we have in the U S  
TER  You also said natural gas prices in North America are severely depressed compared to the rest of the world  You called that a good thing because it would result in a second industrial renaissance  Are you still bullish on the prospects for natural gas as an economic engine for the U S  
FG  Low Natural Gas prices are good for the consumer and drive U S  manufacturing  But I also believe in free trade  and the U S  government should allow LNG exports to higher price markets  mainly in the Far East and Europe  If we had built large LNG export terminals  we could have significantly reduced Europe s dependence on Russian gas 
TER  What companies are benefitting from the fracking boom 
FG  Domestic oil and gas producers  as well as oil service companies  Infrastructure and transportation companies are also joining the party  despite regulatory hurdles 
TER  How are the large  integrated oil companies faring in the new energy environment  What catalysts are you watching during earnings season 
FG  The stocks of the large international oil companies have not performed well in the last 10 years  as they lagged all other energy sectors and the market in general  They are viewed as defensive investments  but offer no real growth  They have above market dividend yield  but are not attractive enough for investors who favor the pure plays of refiners or oil and gas producers 
As far as individual company catalysts  Royal Dutch Shell s Royal Dutch Shell A  BA RDS  new CEO  Ben van Beurden  has increased the emphasis on profits  capital efficiency and returns  Lower CAPEX and increased divestments should reduce net investments  We expect Shell to generate free cash flow of over  20 billion   20B  over the next two years  We think this is a good start and rate it a Perform 
We will be watching production growth  cost trends  capital spending and plans to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks 
TER  What about the prospects for the large independent exploration and production  E P  companies 
FG  The large E P companies are more attractive than the integrated companies  less volatile than the refiners and more stable than the small producers  Each has a catalyst  Anadarko Petroleum Corp   NYSE APC  benefited from a legal settlement  Apache benefited from restructuring  and so did Hess Corp   NYSE HES  and Murphy Oil Corp   NYSE MUR   EOG Resources Inc   NYSE EOG  and Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD  benefited from oil production growth  while investors are waiting for the restructuring of Occidental Petroleum Corp   NYSE OXY  to take place  Marathon Oil  NYSE MRO  and Devon Energy Corp   NYSE DVN  have lagged  but offer the lowest valuations in the group  Cabot Oil   Gas Corp   NYSE COG  and Range Resources Corp   NYSE RRC  will continue to reflect natural gas prices and additional pipeline capacity  which have constrained production growth 
As I mentioned in a recent research report  with higher production growth than the majors  a higher dividend yield and a lower valuation than E P peers  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  offers an alternative to both groups  We raised our 12 18 month price target to  85 from  80 to reflect an improving outlook on stronger financial and operating results and rated them outperform

126892,348407,PXD,Explosive Growth Opportunities  A Better Way To Play Big Oil ,opinion,"When it comes to America s shale boom your eyes shouldn t be on  big oil  
Pardon me while I generalize substantially  But  big oil left the U S  oil patch years ago  Companies went overseas  they went offshore  they started researching alternative fuels   with each step they moved further from conventional oil production 
These big companies were thinking conventionally  They thought the commercial amounts of U S  oil were long gone  And they were dead wrong 
Small companies with determined owners cracked the code to America s shale plays  They thought unconventionally and it s paying dividends today   for citizens and investors alike 
That s why today we re going to revisit a list of companies that are on their way to becoming the next  big oil  players  Right here in the U S  As these companies gear up production and start lowering costs with efficiencies we re in for a few Exxon like run ups 
Just as Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  got its start back in the U S  oil patch  a few companies are set to ramp up production and grow larger than most Wall Street analysts would ever believe 
It s THESE companies I urge you to focus on today  not the big oil companies  like Exxon 
I ve said it before but it s worth repeating  by some merits a company like Exxon has become too big for its own good  Sure  the scope of a big oil candidate like Exxon offers a  safer   more diversified investment  But if you re looking for a growth story you won t find it in Exxon 
Just think about it  Exxon is working all around the world  offshore  onshore  Middle East  non Middle East  some harsh conditions  some not  basically anywhere they can find oil   almost at any cost  Plus the company is also working on alternative energy solutions like biofuel  I have no clue how much the company spent last year on biofuel or other alternative technologies  but I bet it s a LARGE number 
The companies that I want to share with you today don t have a biofuel budget  For the most part they don t have much international exposure or offshore activity  Simply put  these companies are focused on producing as much American oil as they can  as cheap as they can  That s exactly how Exxon got its start  And it s a winning strategy in today s domestic energy boom 
So  without further ado  let s revisit my list of explosive growth opportunities 
The following list won t be long  But  the companies I m about to list hold immense growth potential 
They all have lots of acreage in America s shale plays   particularly in the hotspots  like Texas  Eagle Ford and North Dakota s Bakken  As production ramps up and more oil gets discovered  or  technology d  out of the ground  these companies will grow well beyond Wall Street s modest expectations 
Remember  the value of any company s share hinges on its future revenue stream  The companies you ll find below are about to tap rivers of cash 
EOG Resources  EOG    market cap   58 billion  EOG is a huge player in America s shale game  In particular the company holds some prime acreage in the Eagle Ford shale  as well as the Bakken and Permian shale plays   The company expects to be a  best in class  crude oil growth story through  at least  2017 
Using the most recent data  production has grown over 40  a year for the past four years  The company currently produces 285 000 barrels per day  bpd  up from just 55 000 bpd in 2009 
Plus  according to company data  at current drilling rates EOG will have another 12 years of drilling in the Eagle Ford  same goes for the Bakken   that s likely to be 12 years of growing production  And if growth continues as I expect in the three formations that EOG holds acreage  production numbers should just continue to leap higher 
Marathon Oil Corporation  NYSE MRO    market cap   25 billion  As a caveat to adding Marathon Oil to this list of Exxon like growth potential  it s important to note that this company is much less of a pure play than the others on the list  To see Marathon achieve that  big oil  growth we ll want to see a focus on their domestic plays  like the prime acreage they have in the Eagle Ford 
According to Lance Robertson  Vice President for Marathon s Eagle Ford operations   They are going to get a lot better next year  
Again  Marathon is less of a pure play here  But we can t disregard the acreage position they have in the Eagle Ford  There s certainly some long term Exxon like potential  Indeed  there s still mucho growth left in the company s South Texas fields 
Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD    market cap   30 billion  In 2009 Pioneer was a  4 billion company  Today the company is over six times that size and I don t see an end to their growth  This company is truly on pace to be the next Exxon like growth story  And remember  Exxon s market cap is around  390 billion  so there s plenty of room for Pioneer to grow  that represents a 13 bagger  if you re wondering  
With production in the Eagle Ford ramping up  through more drilling  down spacing and cost savings this company could start throwing off loads of cash  But that s not where their resource run ends 
According to CEO Scott Sheffield in the Permian Basin of West Texas is like  12 Eagle Fords stacked on top of each other   Pioneer is a huge acreage holder in the Permian   the sky is the limit here 
On top of that  and looking years out  Pioneer also holds prime acreage in the dry gas section of the Eagle Ford  So a decade from now when U S  shale oil production is commonplace  natural gas may be back in vogue  If that s the case  watch out because Pioneer will be a huge producer 
And here s a funny one 
Last year  I was at the Developing Unconventionals conference in San Antonio  just north of Eagle Ford production zones  and it hit me  There I was watching the Q A for Pioneer Natural Resources  About halfway through the questions  a man stood up and asked how  in the next decade or so  Pioneer expects to spend all of its money  exploring elsewhere  Maybe dividend payouts 
Frankly the response from the Pioneer s Chairman   CEO  Scott Sheffield  wasn t too memorable  He breezed over the cycle of shale plays and how eventually all plays become  cash cows    so at some point the Eagle Ford and Permian will hit that stage of the cycle  But  it s gonna grow for a long time  says Sheffield 
But here s the funny part  It was amazing how nonchalant everyone in the room was  Pioneer is looking at so much growth potential people are worried about what they re going to do with all of their cash for decades to come  Nice problem to have  eh 
For now  who cares what the company s answer is  As the cash continues to roll in and production continues to ramp up  this company   and ones like it   should be on your radar 
Oasis Petroleum Inc  NYSE OAS    market cap   5 billion  This list wouldn t be complete without mentioning a standout in North Dakota  Oasis Petroleum  Although the company holds most of its exposure in that one play  it has plenty of room for growth 
Much like the companies working in the Eagle Ford  Oasis is testing its ability to down space its Bakken wells  This company is the cheapest on the list too  with a market cap around  4 billion  So keep an eye on the future for this mini Exxon 
Add it all up and I wouldn t be surprised to see all of the companies listed above crack the  100 billion market cap level 
On the low end that means a 70  gain  On the high end  a 1 900  gain 
Looking at the share price over the past four months  we re starting to see a nice uptrend emerge  too  The companies listed above are up 26   14   21   25  and 17  respectively in that time frame  Now s a good time to look at this outperforming bunch 
Besides the numbers  just keep in mind that the oil industry is changing in front of our eyes  Smaller  laser focused companies like we highlighted above are going to provide the best growth opportunities in the next decade  In that sense  keep your eyes on  small oil  for the biggest gains

126893,348408,PXD,U S  Crude  A Look At Exports,opinion,"This Great Graphic  posted by Sumit Roy on Hard Assets  is based on data from the US Energy Information Administration   It shows the surge in US Crude Oil exports  They totaled more than 250k barrels a day in April  a 15 month high or about 3  of the 8 2 mln barrels a day produced in the US in March 

Ironically  US has banned crude oil exports for nearly 40 years   What is up with that  It turns out that there a several exceptions that the Commerce Department can grant  and apparently does  According to Roy these include 
Exports from Alaska s Cook Inlet
Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein
Exports in connection with the refining or exchange of strategic petroleum reserve oil
Exports that are consistent with international energy supply agreements
Exports of foreign origin crude
Exports of California heavy crude up to an average of 25 000 b d
Temporary exports or exchanges
Almost all the US crude oil exports have been sent to Canada  according to the EIA  Separately  earlier this week  the Department of Commerce granted permission to two US companies  Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD  and Enterprise Products Partners  NYSE EPD  to consider its condensate  an oil lighter than regular crude   sufficiently processed to allow it to be exported without a license  Like unrefined crude oil  condensate has generally fallen under the export ban  though the US Department of Commerce indicated this did not reflect a change in policy  Oil is not a homogeneous product and therein lies a challenge for the US industry and regulators  Essentially  the shale boom has created a large supplies of light oil  but the refineries in the Gulf area  are designed to absorb the heavy crude  like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia sell  The US production of ultralight or condensate accounts for nearly the entire increase in US output over the last couple of years  Meanwhile  the US is still importing a little less than half of its crude oil needs  Many in the industry argue that unless there is greater capability to export the ultralight crude or condensate  the resulting glut would drive the price down below levels that would sustain expansion of US output  Pioneer has not indicated how much condensate it will export  but industry experts are quoted in the press suggesting something on the magnitude of 50 000 100 000 barrels a day  Asia is thought to be the likely destination as there are growing markets  and a number of countries  including South Korea have significant petrochemical industries  The exporting of oil is a politically sensitive issue  Increased exports may raise domestic prices to the detriment of American consumers  while at the same time making supply available to foreign businesses  In addition  from a macro point of view  it is better to add value to raw materials before exporting ",2014-06-26,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-crude:-a-look-at-exports-217555,217555
126896,348411,PXD,6 Top Firms For The Ongoing Energy Boom,opinion,"The monster year for the U S  energy sector in 2013 set the stage for an even bigger blowout in 2014  And that s exactly what s happening  especially in the natural gas industry  Higher natural gas prices have led to recent 52 week highs for companies like Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK   Encana  NYSE ECA   and Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   
Don t think you ve missed the boat on profits  though  Here are three other top players that should see a dramatic uptick in shares as the rest of the year unfolds   along with my No  1 trick for spotting the best opportunities in today s market 
The Outlook for Natural Gas
Just as the North American winter was brutal   and put a major dent in natural gas supplies   cooler than expected summer weather has allowed the industry to beef up reserves to higher than expected levels 
The result  Natural gas is now retesting its year lows at around  4 20 
There are two scenarios we could see from here  On the downside  if the price breaks below  4 per thousand cubic feet  mcf   we could see the mid  3 level in a hurry 
On the upside  if the  4 per mcf level holds  we could see another spike to the mid  5 range in the fall   just as the weather gets cooler and speculation mounts about the possibility of a 2013 style winter   In the commodities world  sometimes all you need is a mere hint of higher or lower prices  and the market will respond accordingly  
That still gives Chesapeake  Encana  and Devon  as well as other natural gas stocks  strong investment potential at current levels   especially during the current pullback 
The Top Metric to Consider
Consider that energy companies in general are coming off a year in 2013 where both reserves and profits increased over 2012  even as capital expenditures actually decreased 
Expenditures in 2013 declined by 7   to  173 5 billion  from 2012  This  coupled with higher natural gas prices  propelled profits  After tax profits jumped to  33 4 billion in 2013   up 53  over 2013 
In order for this trend to continue  companies will need to focus on two words  proven reserves  That is  what companies can actually reach economically  based on current prices  Everything else is just speculation 
Amid all the hype  proven reserves represent the No  1 element to consider with regard to new energy discoveries   be they onshore  offshore  or shale plays  Last year  oil and gas flowed at a record pace  with production replacement rates well over 200   This means companies added more to their reserves than they were producing  In order for companies to sustain long term production  this rate needs to stay over 100   otherwise companies will eventually run out of oil 
This upward trend looks set to continue   or even accelerate   over the remainder of 2014  as economic growth picks up 
In addition  the recent uptick in new job creation and dip in the unemployment rate to 6 1  means there will be a lot more spending on energy  That will further boost oil  gasoline  and especially natural gas prices in the months ahead  For the U S  energy sector  it just doesn t get any better than this 
To play the boom  it s critical that you only focus on companies that are really participating in the boom  In addition to the three I mentioned earlier  I ve pinpointed lesser known names like EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD   and up and coming plays like Laredo Petroleum  NYSE LPI  
These companies boast significant upside potential  They re either sitting on massive reserves that are well above industry replacement rates  or are exploring in prolific areas like the Permian Basin ",2014-07-16,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/6-top-firms-for-the-ongoing-energy-boom-219634,219634
126901,348416,PXD,Oil And Gas Investor s Leslie Haines  We Will Never Stop Importing ,opinion,"Horizontal drilling and fracking have opened new opportunities for investing in domestic energy  whether for pure play explorers in developing shales  producers in mature areas  or service companies opening up the monster wells  Oil and Gas Investor Editor in Chief Leslie Haines has been following the revolution for nine years  and agreed to share with readers of The Energy Report the names of some beneficiaries of new technology s multiplier effect 
The Energy Report  As editor in chief of Oil and Gas Investor  based in Houston  you follow the development of U S  shale closely  Is the U S  really on track to energy independence  or will depletion rates cut this boom short  What are the production numbers telling you 
Leslie Haines  I have been covering shale development since 2005  and it looks like we are on track for energy independence by 2020 or so  However  we re never going to stop importing oil because supply diversity is prudent 
Depletion rates are significant in every shale play  Some of the depletion rates are quite steep in the early years of a play  but wells tend to produce for 20 years or so at a lower rate  so overall production rates are still growing 
The monthly U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reports show that in H1 14  U S  gas natural production alone increased by more than 4 billion cubic feet a day  4 Bcf d   The bulk is coming from the Northeast  from the Marcellus and Utica plays in Pennsylvania  Ohio and West Virginia  Also  a lot of new natural gas is coming on  in association with oil production in West Texas  in the Permian Basin  and in south Texas  in the Eagle Ford play  While some gas areas might be declining  we re getting enough new natural gas to offset that decline  In fact  both oil and natural gas production in this country are the highest they ve been in about 35 years 
Natural gas in storage was down last year  and now we re refilling  Every summer and fall  you refill storage to prepare for winter  It looks like we re going to have a lot of gas in storage  We ve had a fairly mild summer and haven t had a huge call for natural gas for air conditioning  compared to what it could have been  Between the production and the weather factors  it looks like we ll have plenty of gas in storage for the fall 
TER  How will the development of monster wells  as they re being called  impact that balance 
LH  When we say monster well  we are referring to an above average initial flow  We re seeing this happen in the Utica play in West Virginia and southern Ohio  Some very large dry gas wells are being reported with initial flows of 20 25 million cubic feet of gas a day  20 25 MMcf d   That s a huge gas well by anybody s measure  It is just one more example of U S  production surging due to horizontal drilling and fracking  Those two techniques combined have revolutionized everything in this country and allowed us to recover a lot more of the underground reservoir 
TER  The techniques continue to develop as more environmentally friendly and efficient methods are discovered  What are some new techniques you are seeing 
LH  The size of the average frack is getting quite a bit bigger  It used to be that the horizontal leg might only go out 1 000 2 000 feet  1 000 2 000 ft   Now  it s going out as far as 5 000 7 000 ft horizontally  so the well bore is exposed to more of the reservoir  The size of the fracks has also gotten bigger  with 20 or 30 frack stages along a lateral  That has increased production 
In one basin  you may find the number of formations that can be tapped is quite numerous  In the Permian Basin of West Texas  for example  more than 5 000 vertical feet of pay can be tapped  If you sink three horizontal legs into that well  three different horizons can be fracked and produce from one well  It triples the effect of that well and acreage 
TER  What s an example of a company taking advantage of that multiplier effect 
LH  Two good examples are Pioneer Natural Resources Co   NYSE PXD  and Concho Resources Inc   NYSE CXO  in the Permian Basin  Production is soaring  In fact  Pioneer is one of the companies that recently received special permission from the government to export a little bit of condensate as a test case  Pioneer is a very active proponent of exporting crude 
TER  Is the company testing price impact  or market demand  or something else 
LH  All of the above  The company is trying to prove to the government that we need to be able to export crude oil in addition to refined products like gasoline  It is very controversial 
TER  In the absence of exporting  are we producing too much  The EIA s Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report showed 2 801 Bcf at the beginning of September  Is oversupply keeping the price of natural gas down 
LH  A lot of Wall Street analysts have reduced their outlooks for oil and gas pricing and company earnings projections through the rest of this year and into next year  For example  Bernstein Research just came out with a report in which it is bringing down its natural gas price estimate for 2015 from  4 50 thousand cubic feet   4 50 Mcf  to  4 Mcf  It plans to leave the price there through 2016 
We are seeing such an incredible surge in supply of both oil and gas that producers  analysts and investors are starting to get a little bit worried  We had very high natural gas prices a few years ago  and then the surge of new production  combined with a mild winter  made the price of natural gas go right back down  At one point  natural gas was below  4 Mcf  It s come back a little this year  but there is still quite a bit of concern 
TER  Are today s prices less than what it costs to pull the oil out of the ground 
LH  Producers are still making money  but the prices for drilling and fracking are inching up because there s so much demand for wells to be drilled and fracked 
TER  You sat on a panel at the  conference in Dallas with S A Resource Report newsletter writer Matt Badiali earlier this year to talk about the future of shale  He divides the shales into mature  the Bakken and the Eagle Ford   and developing  the Tuscaloosa  Utica and Cline areas   Are investors rewarding companies with shale play diversity  or is it considered smarter to master one shale type 
LH  The stock market used to reward companies for diversity  Investors wanted to see a balance between oil and gas  and two  three or four different project areas  However  that has changed  Now investors favor pure play companies  A company like Oasis Petroleum Inc   NYSE OAS   which is in just one play  the Bakken  has done very well in the last year 
Sanchez Energy Corp   NYSE SN   which is in the Eagle Ford and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale  is not being rewarded for the Mississippi project yet  The Tuscaloosa play is still developing  and hasn t proven to be economic yet  The company has some expensive wells with downhole technical challenges  The players in that area are still working on solving the geology  In the Eagle Ford  however  Sanchez is very experienced and successful  That part of its business is well recognized 
But  in general  I would say that diversity is not being rewarded in the market at this time  It s better for companies to focus on two or three plays at the most  and in well established areas like the Bakken  the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus 
TER  Are there still upside opportunities in the established shales 
LH  The Marcellus Formation is considered the second largest gas field in the world  Production keeps growing every quarter  It s difficult for a company to get in there now  Most of the lease positions are already carved out  Companies have gone beyond finding the sweet spots  and are focusing on two things  One is how to drill a more efficient well faster  while reducing costs  The other is infrastructure  The Marcellus and Utica plays are constrained because there is not enough pipeline to get all the gas to market  A ton of midstream projects have been proposed and are underway  Billions of dollars are being spent to build pipeline infrastructure to move the gas not only to the population centers in the northeast  but also to eastern Canada  Some of the gas is going to be piped down to the petrochemical plants on the Gulf Coast  Some of the gas is even being piped to the West  to Chicago and beyond 
TER  This sounds like more of a manufacturing operation  now that companies don t seem to be drilling dry holes anymore  Who are the main players 
LH  Companies like Cabot Oil   Gas Corp   NYSE COG   Range Resources Corp   NYSE RRC   Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK   Petroleum Development Corp   PETD NASDAQ  and EQT Corp   EQT Corporation  NYSE EQT  are doing quite well in the Marcellus  The same thing is true in the Bakken  the Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin  Some 20 companies may drill a play  but a handful do most of the work  And they are the bigger companies 
TER  Do you envision mergers and acquisitions in that space  as some of these companies mature 
LH  It s really about the play maturing  We see a similar pattern in every shale play  Companies decide that a play is relatively mature  and that they can make a higher return somewhere else  They put their assets on the market  sell to somebody else in that play or to a master limited partnership  MLP   and then redeploy their money into another play that might have a faster growth trajectory 
TER  What is a recent example of that 
LH  Marathon Oil Corp   NYSE MRO  sold its North Sea assets to redeploy more capital to the Eagle Ford  which has much higher returns 
TER  You wrote a September cover story on service and supply companies  which is one way investors are leveraging the oil and gas industry  Are margins increasing in that business 
LH  It looks like they re about to  yes  Almost 1 900 rigs are drilling in this country at any given time  I d say 90  of those wells will need to be fracked  That is an enormous demand for rig crews  frack crews and all the associated equipment and materials  Last year  about 17 million hydraulic horsepower was installed  The amount of horsepower available for fracking has probably doubled in the last five years  Everything is bigger  longer  higher pressure more  more  more  Service companies have pricing power because there is such a frenzy of activity right now 
TER  There are many types of service companies  Is there one part of that industry that s growing faster than the others 
LH  One bright spot is in companies that provide sand for fracking  They ve been doing extremely well in the marketplace  Their stocks are way up  and they keep adding new capacity  to deliver yet more sand to the marketplace for fracking  The oil field service index  PHLX Oil Service Sector  OSX NASDAQ   has risen steadily since January  and the hottest subsector seems to be the frack sand providers  Some of them have tripled in the past 12 months 
TER  What are some examples of solid frack sand providers 
LH  US Silica Holdings  NYSE SLCA   Hi Crush Partners LP  NYSE HCLP  and Emerge Energy Services LP  EMES NYSE  are three  Their revenues mirror the increase in drilling activity  which could be 14  in the next year  That is why analysts are telling us that it looks like profit margins have come off their lows  and service prices are starting to rise again 
TER  Thank you for taking the time to talk to us 
LH  Thank you

126920,348435,PXD,A Major Shift Could Drive Stocks in Coming Years,opinion,Many investors have been surprised by the steady advances in the stock market since it bottomed out three years ago  They shouldn t have been  History predicted it would happen  Exiting a major economic slowdown  companies cut costs fairly quickly  leading to a tremendous spike in profit margins  Consider this statistic  Companies in the S P 500 boosted per share profits by 38  in 2010  with roughly 80  of that coming from margin gains  Sales growth accounted for the remainder The margin gains posted by companies moderated in 2011  but were still good enough for the S P 500 s profits to rise by 16  on an aggregated basis  Yet in the just completed fourth quarter  an ominous sign appeared  profit margins fell slightly from a year earlier  for the first time since early 2009 Looking ahead  this should be  the new normal   Year over year profit margins are expected to fall slightly in the first three quarters of 2012 and rise only modestly in the fourth quarter  The clear takeaway  to boost profits  companies are increasingly relying on good old fashioned sales growth  The good news  a moderate rise in the U S  gross domestic productshould do the trick for a number of stocks such as banks  retailers and late cycle industrial plays  The bad news  companies that see minimal sales growth may actually see profits slip back as labor and material expenses rise higher Analysts at UBS figure S P 500 profits will likely rise roughly 5  this year  And thanks to a move up toward 3  GDP growth in 2013  profits could rise a more robust 9  in 2013  This pales in comparison to the gains seen in 2010 and 2011  but is probably good enough to keep the market from slumping badly  They also predict the S P 500 will end the year at 1 475  roughly 5  ahead of current levels   Most Wall Street firms have raised their S P 500 price targets since    but still see little further upside from current levels You ll occasionally come across market prognosticators that predict that the stock market will surge much higher in coming quarters  and a few have tossed off  Dow 20 000  predictions to garner some buzz  I think UBS and the other firms are closer to the mark  They missed this rally with their year end prognostications  but with the market s price to earnings  P E   14 6  now higher than its projected earnings growth rate  12 2    further euphoria may be capped  That said  a drop in oil prices and an expected eventual pullback in the dollar could be a plus for corporate profits  As analysts at UBS note   risks to our revenue and  earnings per share  EPS estimates are weighted to the upside  Even if profit targets for the S P 500 come in as expected  many individual stocks can rise appreciably higher    it s just important you stay cognizant of the macro picture spelled out above regarding profit margins  It s crucial that you assume some margin slippage in your own earnings assumptions  and you ll need to gut check your sales growth assumptions as well  Europe remains challenged  so any S P 500 companies with major European exposure could disappoint on the earnings front this year Roughly 90 companies in the S P 500 are expected to boost sales at least 10  in 2013  according to Thomson Reuters  And roughly two thirds of those companies    or 12  of the S P 500    should be able to do so again in 2014  Notably  almost all of those companies are also expected to boost EPS by at least 10  in 2013 and again in 2014 But what if we tighten the noose  looking for companies that should see sustained sales and profit growth of at least 15  in 2013 and 2014  The group falls to just 15 stocks  representing 3  of the S P 500 There are some great growth stocks on this list  but it doesn t mean investors will  or should  shun value stocks  Indeed  a number of genuine bargains still exist in the S P 500  if you are willing to tolerate decent but not robust sales and profit growth  I went back and looked at the 90 companies that should see 10  sales and profit gains in each of the next few years  and found a 15 of them selling for less than 15 times projected 2013 profits Only Google  Nasdaq  GOOG  and Sandisk  Nasdaq  SNDK  make both lists  implying they hold appeal for both growth and value investors  Of course  many other variables will be in play as the market digests sales and profit trends in the coming quarters  For example  natural gas firm Chesapeake Energy  NYSE  CHK  will need to shore up its balance sheet if it is to fund its capital spending plans for 2012 that yield expected growth in 2013  Conversely  if natural gas prices manage to start rebounding  Chesapeake  Noble Energy  NYSE  NBL   Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE  PXD  and many other stocks could see huge share price appreciation in the years ahead  You ll note auto parts supplier BorgWarner  NYSE  BWA  in the group above  Many suppliers and auto makers    including my favorite auto play    Ford Motor  NYSE  F  increasingly appear poised to exceed consensus sales forecasts  as monthly sales trends now imply a faster growing U S  auto industry   I own shares of Ford  F   Whether profit growth can follow suit will be a function of controlled expenses and a stabilized Europe  Risks to Consider  The U S  economy is expected to grow nearly 3  in 2012 and again in 2013  There are still enough headwinds in place to lead economists to lower their views  including a deepening slump in Europe    our biggest trade partner    and the negative effects of tax cut expirations expected at the end of this year  A spike in oil prices could also quickly derail the U S  economy as consumers retrench anew  Action to Take     After stunning multi year gains  it s time to lower expectations for the stock market  Focus on stocks that have moderate upside with considerable downside protection  It s exactly the kind of focus I take and I wouldn t do it if I didn t think it was the absolute best way to approach the market right now  The  swing for the fences  approach may no longer be advisable now that profit margin pressures change the dynamic of corporate profits ,2012-03-21,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-major-shift-could-drive-stocks-in-coming-years-117714,117714
126921,348436,PXD,Mat Wilson  Following The Money To Undervalued Contrarian Plays,opinion,If you look very closely  you ll find some big players in the energy market sinking a lot of dollars into some very unconventional plays  Mat Wilson  an analyst with Pinetree Capital in Toronto  is following a trail of billion dollar shale exploration and development investments from Canada to Texas and South America  Wilson tells The Energy Report which small cap names are linked with hefty  large cap investments and why they stand to benefit  The Energy Report  What do you expect will be the hot themes affecting energy commodities in 2013  Mat Wilson  Many of the same themes that drove energy commodities in 2012 will continue to affect them in 2013  There s instability in the Middle East  a bottleneck of infrastructure in North America  the Keystone Pipeline and the continuing development of shale wet gas that s occurring throughout the Western Hemisphere  TER  Tell us about your thesis and how it interacts with some of these themes  MW  My thesis is to follow the money  There s a lot of high profile activity in some very interesting unconventional plays  In a world of declining conventional reserves  there s some big spending in North America and internationally in unconventional exploration and development  Exxon Mobil Corp  s  XOM  takeover of Celtic Exploration Ltd   CLT  is an example of a super major entering a liquid rich shale gas formation in Canada  There will be billions of dollars spent over the next 24 months in the Wolfcamp and Cline shales in the Permian Basin of West Texas  There is also huge spending on ongoing activity in Argentina  despite the recent political activity  TER  As of November  Pinetree had about 40 positions in the oil and gas space accounting for about 9  of the total value of the portfolio  Are you seeking to grow those numbers  MW  We re definitely excited about a few different opportunities that are out there in the market and plan on taking advantage of those  We believe we currently hold some of the best names in the small cap space  but will add accordingly if the right opportunity surfaces  TER  Is there such a thing as a  low risk  asset when it comes to small cap E Ps  MW  Definitely not  In the small cap space  everything is very high risk as the asset  no matter how strong  always faces significant operational and financing risk  Small cap companies are always going to face small problems and delays  which can be the difference between an economic well and an uneconomic well and can therefore determine the ability for that company to access future financing in the market  By finding plays with large companies completing large drilling programs  assets within small cap companies become  less risky  as the drill density in the region increases  TER  What s an example of a less risky asset  MW  Two companies that are starting to see a solid de risking to their asset base are the two that I m most bullish on in 2013  Lynden Energy Corp   LVL   which is operating in the Cline and Wolfcamp shales of West Texas  and Americas Petrogas Inc   BOE  in Argentina  Lynden is listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange  based in Vancouver  and exploring in Texas  which has kept the story relatively unknown to many investors despite its strong performance in 2012  Lynden has exposure to more than 100 000 gross acres in the Wolfcamp and Cline shale formation in the Midland Basin of West Texas  We expect the company to report a 2012 exit production rate of about 1 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  1 000 boe d  from 7 000 net acres in the middle of the Wolfcamp basin  This land package and production underpins its current valuation of  100 million   100M  as it recently sold 660 net acres for  25M  What s more exciting here is that the company holds 50  of 68 000 gross acres in Mitchell County  This property is in the middle of Devon Energy Corp  s  DVN  560 000 acre Cline shale package  which is only beginning to be explored  Following the money  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co  Ltd     recently paid Devon  340M in cash and is committed to spend more than  1 billion   1B  for just 30  of the ground in the basin  The majority of that is going to this Cline package  which Lynden s ground is right in the middle of  Just south of this area  Sinochem International Corp  just paid Pioneer Natural Resources Co   PXD   500M in cash and is spending  1 2B to drill 86 horizontal wells in the Wolfcamp  This is adding fuel to the fire in what is turning out to be one of the more exciting American domestic oil plays  Lynden s plan for the year is to continue to push its Wolfcamp production and probably drill a well on its Mitchell property to prove the Cline shale extends through its ground  TER  What was Lynden s production last year and what s its production guidance for this year  MW  Lynden came into 2012 producing 300 400 boe d and its guidance throughout the year was to exit 2012 with 1 000 boe d  Lynden will be reporting soon and we expect its exit production to be in line with its guidance  TER  What s the plan to expand that production in 2013  MW  These are not very expensive wells  so Lynden will continue to rely on its  30M borrowing base to expand production as it has been doing for the last year  TER  It sold roughly  25M worth of acreage  What are the plans for that cash  MW  That cash brought down the borrowing base to essentially zero to allow the company to continue pushing forward on its production expansion  TER  What about Americas Petrogas  MW  Americas Petrogas is a bit of a different story  It s a little bigger than Lynden but is located in a much less stable jurisdiction in Argentina  The Vaca Muerta is the shale formation they are exploring and it is getting a lot of attention from several different super majors  Argentina has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons after it decided to nationalize the Repsol  REPYY OTCPK  stake of the oil and gas company YPF SA  YPF NYSE   The situation is proving to be something of a disaster  The case is in front of the World Bank and YPF is being sued by its American shareholders  But if you look beyond that  you see companies like Exxon  Chevron Corp   CVX   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A  and many others starting to push hard again into this play  If we follow the money  there are billions of dollars going into earn in agreements and spending that will go into the ground over the next 12 24 months  Americas Petrogas holds the largest land package of any small cap name down there  It has earn in deals with Exxon and Apache Corp   APA   Petrogas has four blocks in the northern area of the Vaca Muerta that it has farmed out to Exxon  The first results have been absolutely fantastic from vertical wells with small frack programs and there is room for upside  Realistically  one of those blocks alone could prove to justify the majority of the market cap of Americas Petrogas  Furthermore  it has a very large land package in the southern end of the basin  where it holds a 90  interest  from which we should see results soon  This could also justify a large percentage of its current valuation  There isn t much reason to be worried about financing either  Petrogas has just under  70M in cash and exited 2012 with about 3 000 boe d of production and is going to push that toward 4 000 5 000 boe d this year  That can generate a solid stream of cash flow that it can recycle into its Vaca Muerta land package  TER  Is there any pressure on a company like that to provide a dividend  MW  I don t think so because it s such a high growth area  One thing that s been an interesting development in the oil and gas space is that many companies that are starting to provide dividends are forsaking several growth opportunities  TER  It s a shortsighted plan  MW  A little bit  I understand the need for investors to have cash flow returned to them  but these companies need to push toward growth if they have the finances to do so  In my opinion  this is the only way the reward can outweigh the risk  TER  Nationalization isn t the only risk in Argentina  Companies there also have to buy all of their supplies  for example  in Argentina  It has to be Argentinean equipment  The contractors have to be Argentinean  How is that affecting this company  MW  I think that s a little misunderstood  There is definitely equipment being brought in from abroad  Petrogas is drilling wells in seven days  Its rigs are first class and its crews are doing a great job  so I think that s a bit of a misconstrued notion  TER  So Argentina  because of these big blocks  is worth the risk  MW  I think so  It s a great entry point into the market because Argentina has been such a disaster  making this an ideal contrarian play  The market is so down on the country despite the fact that it still has super majors coming in and spending such large sums of money  A company like Petrogas would be worth multiples of where it is today if it were in almost any other jurisdiction  TER  The margins in natural gas production are very tight in North America  but remain quite healthy elsewhere  Are you actively seeking companies with exposure to markets with healthier natural gas margins  MW  We re always looking for a good international gas play  but they are generally tough to come by  There have been some interesting developments in Europe that we continue to keep our eye on  However  there are still many interesting opportunities in Canada where liquids rich gas allows for strong margins despite weak gas prices in North America  TER  Do you have any plays there  MW  A company worth keeping your eye on is Donnycreek Energy Inc      It has a substantial position in the Montney deep basin where there s been some very interesting developments to date  It s very early stage  but it has released results to date that are in line with the very strong liquids rich gas wells that are currently being drilled in the area  The issue with this area of the Montney is that the amount of success has caused a bit of a bottleneck in the ability to process the vast amount of liquids found in each well  causing the story to move a little slower than initially expected  However  we feel this is a solid long term play and the infrastructure will be worked out in due time  TER  Are there any other companies in South America that are interesting to you  MW  Sintana Energy Inc     has some interesting ground with exposure to the La Luna formation in the Middle Magdalena basin of Colombia  another up and coming shale play  This is much earlier days and the spend is definitely not nearly what it is in West Texas or Argentina  but there are a few wells being drilled this year that will prove very telling to the future of this play  Exxon  Shell and Ecopetrol S A     are starting to push into this area  Sintana farmed out 70  of its VMM 37 block to Exxon for a three well carry and cash  Sintana is a bit of a long term story because there won t be any drilling on its grounds by Exxon until the end of the year or 2014  but there will be some drill density developing in the region  Historical results that have been published from the La Luna formation are very strong  Exxon is also doing deals with other companies in the area that could lead to some interesting results in 2013 and create some excitement for the story  Sintana is run by a very strong team  has  10M in cash and a market cap of only  45M  The company has conventional and unconventional prospects and should be in a position to cash in  should this play heat up  In a sense  the success of these stories is about diversifying reliance on a single source of success  By farming out a portion of ground  establishing cash flow and pushing forward on separate exploration programs  a company is able to avoid being at the mercy of its farm out partner  the market or a single asset  Donnycreek and Lynden don t have big partnerships with companies  but have large land packages and are able to self finance production growth to explore those packages  Petrogas has its joint venture with Exxon  but also has substantial cash flow and a 90  owned block in the south of the basin  as well as a phosphate and potash asset that could end up proving value  When all of the pieces are put together  it allows for development in oil and gas  which is certainly a challenging thing for a small cap company  TER  Thanks for speaking with us  Mathew  Mat Wilson
