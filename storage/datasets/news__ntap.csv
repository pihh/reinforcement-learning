Economists forecast overall inflation measured by the consumer price index in July fell 0 1   compared with a 0 3  rise the prior month  while the core CPI  which excludes volatile food and energy price  is seen falling by 0 1  as well 
That would see year over year CPI growth fall to 1 9  from 2 0  and the core CPI growth remain unchanged at 1 8   
GBP USD has come under heavy pressure against the backdrop of political uncertainty and increasing fears of Britain leaving the European Union on Oct  31 without a trade deal  a hard Brexit 
 Deal or no deal  a general election looks increasingly likely   said James Smith  economist at ING 
3  Crude Inventories in Focus as Oil Rallies
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  releases its weekly petroleum report on Wednesday amid a more positive backdrop for oil prices as United States decided to delay tariffs on some China goods  giving investors a sliver of hope that the world s two biggest economies can put their trade feud on ice  
Ahead of the EIA report  the American Petroleum Institute released data   which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels   showing crude stockpiles fell by 2 19 million barrels last week 
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 2 78 million barrels

172488,394004,NTAP,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  August 14 
1  Signs of economic downturn weigh on sentiment
Worrying data from China and Germany added to fears of a potential global recession 
China s industrial output growth fell to a 17 year low in July in another sign that the trade conflict between Beijing and Washington is denting the world s second largest economy 
Trade tensions also dragged on China s consumer and business confidence with retail sales cooling more than expected while slower than forecast growth in fixed asset investment revealed a marked loss of momentum 
Germany provided no relief to the gloomy outlook as a slump in exports drove its economy into reverse in the second quarter  The 0 1  quarter on quarter decline in gross domestic product led some analysts to speculate that the euro zone s number one economy could enter recession in the third quarter as tariff conflicts and uncertainty over the U K  s departure from the European Union hit the country s manufacturing sector 
2  Stocks pass from trade relief to economic worries
Global stocks were mixed in Wednesday s trade in the wake of Washington s announcement a day earlier that it would delay the implementation of some tariffs on Chinese imports from Sept  1 to Dec  15 
The ensuing relief rally led to sharp gains on Wall Street at Tuesday s close that quickly spread to Asian markets  Hong Kong s Hang Seng was the exception  depressed by fears that Beijing will use force to crack down on local protesters 
But buying enthusiasm faded overnight with European markets dropping and U S  futures pointing to a lower open as markets processed the fact that the U S  delay in tariffs brought the two sides no closer to resolution 
3  U S  2  and 10 year notes on watch amid yield tailspin
A worldwide bond rally was back in swing sending yields on a sharp decline after a brief pause a day earlier 
Markets are keeping a close eye on the yields for the U S  2  and 10 year Treasury notes as the spread hovers around just one basis point  If the 10 year yield passes below that of the 2 year  it would result in an inverted yield curve that economists warn could be a sign of pending recession 
The flight to safety and central bank policy easing worldwide has sent bond yields into a tailspin  The yield on the German Bund  the euro zone s safe haven benchmark  hit a new record low of  0 64  after the GDP failed to elicit any signs of urgency from the government in providing some sort of fiscal support package to the economy 
4  Cisco steps up to earnings plate
Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  will be in the earnings spotlight after the close as the second quarter reporting season winds down  with less than 50 S P firms left on the calendar 
The company will report earnings amid concerns that weaker enterprise spending on networking equipment may dent growth 
A slowdown in network spending was put in the spotlight last week when NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  warned its quarterly revenue would miss estimates  due to uncertainty over the global outlook 
5  Oil drops on unexpected inventory build
Oil prices slid amid further signs of global economic weakness and a surprise build in U S  crude stockpiles 
The American Petroleum Institute s weekly report released late Tuesday showed that inventories unexpectedly rose 3 7 million barrels 
The U S  Energy Information Administration will release official data at 10 30 AM ET   14 30 GMT  amid expectations for a draw of 2 78 million barrels

172526,394042,NTAP,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  August 15 
1  Global Stocks Subdued Amid China  Turkey Jitters
In equities  global stocks were mostly lower in subdued trade  as bearish Chinese markets worsened investor sentiment already hurt by Turkey s financial crisis 
Asian stocks retreated to a one year low  as investors were rattled by another sell off in China  which tumbled more than 2  despite a liquidity injection by the People s Bank of China 
Signs of the world s second largest economy losing momentum and the ongoing Sino U S  trade conflict have weighed on Chinese equities 
The cautious sentiment carried over to Europe  where the region s major bourses were lower as concerns over the Turkish currency crisis continued to affect investors  appetite 
Turkey doubled tariffs on some U S  imports including cars  alcohol and tobacco on Wednesday in retaliation for U S  moves  in the latest escalation in tensions between the two countries 
Despite the news  the Turkish lira rallied a further 3  against the dollar  while the BIST 100 index was down 1 5  
On Wall Street  U S  stock futures looked set to open lower  as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings and economic data 
The blue chip Dow futures indicated a loss of 135 points  or around 0 5   by 6 30AM ET  the S P 500 futures dipped 15 points  or around 0 5  
Meanwhile  the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to a drop of 50 points  or roughly 0 7   as disappointing results from Chinese tech giant Tencent  OTC TCEHY  looked set to drag down the sector 
2  Macy s Reports Earnings
Macy s  NYSE M  is one of the last notable names slated to report fiscal second quarter results before U S  markets open  as the earnings season continues to wind down 
The retailer is expected to report earnings of 50 cents per share on revenue of  5 56 billion  according to estimates 
Investors will be closely watching the results for a view of general consumer confidence in the economy  Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70  of U S  economic growth 
Shares of Macy s were trading little changed in premarket  The stock has more than doubled over the last year as the retail sector   beaten down through 2015 and 2016   has staged a big comeback over that period 
Other headliners expected out today include S P 500 members NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  and Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   both due after the bell 



3  Dollar Hits Another 13 Month Peak
Away from equities  the U S  dollar hit another 13 month high against a basket of major currencies  as safe haven demand rooted in fears over fallout from the Turkish lira s recent drop boosted the U S  currency 
The U S  dollar index was up 0 15  to 96 70  after climbing to an overnight peak of 96 76  its best level since June 27  2017 
The greenback s strength has also been bolstered by a drop for the euro  as investors continued to worry over the region s banking sector exposure to the Turkish economy 
The euro was last down about 0 2  at 1 1325  EUR USD   after earlier touching a new 13 month low of 1 1317 
The pound also hit a 13 month low  dropping 0 2  to 1 2692  before crawling back to 1 2715  GBP USD  
Elsewhere in foreign exchange markets  China s offshore yuan weakened about 0 3   last trading at 6 9175 yuan per dollar after falling as far as 6 9210  its lowest level since March 2017 
In the bond market  the benchmark 10 year Treasury note yield declined 1 basis point to 2 882  after poking above 2 900  on Tuesday 
4  U S  Retail Sales In Focus
On the data front  the Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for July at 8 30AM ET 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0 2  last month  moderating from a gain of 0 5  in June 
Excluding the automobile sector  sales are expected to increase 0 4   the same as its increase a month earlier 
Also on the economic calendar will be the New York Fed s Empire State manufacturing reading for the month of August  followed by the Federal Reserve s July report on industrial production and the NAHB s homebuilder sentiment reading for August 
Economists reckon the data will do little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates two more times this year  with the next move higher coming at its September meeting 
5  Oil Slips Ahead Of EIA Supply Report
The U S  Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended August 10 at 10 30AM ET

Sentiment was also clouded by a darkening economic outlook which could start impacting oil demand  traders said 
Elsewhere in commodity markets  gold prices extended their decline to a 19 month low  as the yellow metal found little in the way of safety flows 
Spot gold fell  6 90  or 0 6   to  1 187 20  its lowest level since January 2017 
Copper futures were also down sharply  slumping 2 7  to hit a 14 month low of  2 608 a pound ",2018-08-15,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-1574889,1574889
172527,394043,NTAP,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  November 14 
1  Global Growth Woes Knock Stocks Lower
Global stock markets were on the backfoot  as appetite for riskier assets weakened amid mounting concerns over a slowdown in global economic growth 
Fears over the health of the global economy intensified after data showed that Germany s economy contracted in the third quarter for the first time since 2015

International Brent crude oil futures rose 44 cents  or 0 7   to  65 94 per barrel  following a plunge of more than 6  a day earlier

The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was little changed at 97 15  The index hit a 16 month high of 97 53 on Monday 
In the bond market  U S  Treasury prices edged higher  pushing yields lower across the curve  with the benchmark 10 year yield falling to 3 14

172621,394137,NTAP,Earnings Preview  NetApp  NTAP  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  reports results for the quarter ended January 2020  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 46 billion  down 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 4  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NetApp 
For NetApp  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 32  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NetApp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NetApp would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  15 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NetApp doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-netapp-ntap-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200504929,200504929

172655,394171,NTAP,NetApp  NTAP  Q2 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 09 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 94 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 06 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 15 96   A quarter ago  it was expected that this data storage company would post earnings of  0 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 65  delivering a surprise of 14 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
NetApp  which belongs to the Zacks Computer  Storage Devices industry  posted revenues of  1 37 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 13   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 52 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
NetApp shares have added about 0 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 23 3  
What s Next for NetApp 
While NetApp has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for NetApp was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 19 on  1 50 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 13 on  5 66 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Computer  Storage Devices is currently in the bottom 37  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/netapp-ntap-q2-earnings-top-estimates-200485128,200485128

172657,394173,NTAP,GW Pharmaceuticals  NetGear  Cisco Systems And NetApp Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 14  2019    Shares of GW Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GWPH   as the Bull of the Day  NetGear   NASDAQ NTGR   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO   and NetApp   NASDAQ NTAP   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  GW Pharmaceuticalsis the  3 5 billion biotechnology company with the first FDA approved cannabis derived drug  Epidiolex was created and tested starting four years ago for the treatment of two rare forms of childhood epilepsy and launched commercially one year ago For more on the 20 year history of GW Pharma research and development in cannabis based medicines  see my September  On November 5  GW released third quarter results and announced Epidiolex U S  year to date net sales of  188 0 million  including Q3 net sales of  86 1 million  Here were other highlights from the quarter     Over 15 000 patients have received Epidiolex prescriptions since launch  Over 3 000 physicians have generated dispensed prescriptions since launch  Strong payor coverage with approximately 93 percent of all Commercial  Medicaid and Medicare lives in the US having a coverage determination  of which 65 percent are PA to indication or less restrictiveThe insurance reimbursement factor is extremely important as doctors may choose Epidiolex for their patients but payers may still making adjustments to allow cannabinoid medicines into their approved protocols yet  But the November 5 GW Pharma report didn t  wow the crowd  because the sales growth this quarter wasn t as dramatic as the prior two since the Epidiolex launch  And thus the gap down in GWPH shares of over 15  the following day And I saw that drop to  110 as a buying opportunity  Here was the buy alert to my TAZR Trader members last week    GW Pharmaceuticals  Buying between  105 and  115 over the next week Despite the top and bottom beats  there was concern in the GWPH quarter about discontinued prescriptions and a slower growth rate of new patients But overall  much of the risk has been taken out of the stock    with projected 2020 sales growth of 93  to  580 million    and I look for it to bottom near above the Oct lows of  105 Here were some of the analyst reactions to the quarter   Piper Jaffray Analyst Danielle Brill lowered her price target for GW Pharmaceuticals to  160 from  210 saying the ceiling for Epidiolex may be lower than originally projected due to patient discontinuations  However  she does  not think we re close to hitting a plateau  following GW s Q3 results  In the midterm  the analyst expects the ongoing European launch  additional off label usage and label expansion into the tuberous sclerosis complex to serve as primary drivers of growth  Brill  who lowered her peak sales estimate for Epidiolex to  1 5B from  2 0B  believes the 12  post earnings selloff in shares of GW Pharmaceuticals is overdone  Continued growth over the coming quarters should  restore confidence and drive shares higher   she says  The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the stock Stifel Nicolaus Reiterate their Buy rating on a 3Q19 that may inevitably raise questions surrounding the Epidiolex runway  but ultimately provides a buying opportunity for the stock on weakness  The analysts decreased their numbers for 4Q and 2020  as they acknowledge being overly optimistic heading into 3Q  But they still think current consensus    specifically  Street estimates published before last night s report    remain beatable  This view takes GW management commentary at face value  that the Epidiolex patient add rate   3000  observed from 2Q to 3Q  while slower than 2Q  is sustainable going forward  Stifel analysts also think the potential for improving access in 2020 could represent an upside lever that isn t accounted for in Street estimates  PT lowered from  228 to  215 Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Analyst David Lebowitz said GW Pharmaceuticals  U S  Epidiolex sales of about  86M in Q3  ultimately is a strong number that supports long term projections   but it also is likely short of investors  high expectation following  dramatic beats  posted in the first two full quarters of the drug being on the market  Epidiolex has been prescribed by over 3 000 physicians  which is up from 2 500  and the target prescribing base remains 6 000  noted Lebowitz  He would be a buyer on any weakness given his unchanged view on the drug s long term prospects and keeps an Overweight rating on GW shares with a slightly lowered price target of  231  down from  233 Oppenheimer Analyst Esther Rajavelu lowered her price target for GW Pharmaceuticals to  222 following the company s quarterly results  saying Q3 revenues were in line with estimates  Though GW Pharmaceuticals met her Q3 topline expectations  Rajavelu tells investors in a research note that she is lowering Epidiolex revenue estimates for future periods as she anticipates moderating new patient numbers and higher attrition rates  She keeps an Outperform rating on the shares  as she continues to believe Epidiolex use in multiple seizure types is not fully reflected in the stock at current levels Bottom line  the only FDA approved pipeline for cannabis derived medicines could have dozens of products at some point  especially with label expansion opportunities And the new FDA approvals could launch the stock back toward  200 very quickly This is a revolutionary pharma company growing sales to over  500 million next year and probably  1 billion by 2022  At a sub  4 billion market cap  that s a buy  end of TAZR buy alert commentary on Nov 6 European UpdateIf you read my September article  you know that GW Pharma was founded in the UK in 1998 and has been solely focused on medical cannabis R D for over two decades And their first UK government approval was for Sativex in the treatment of multiple sclerosis  MS  in 2010  Here were the bullets that GW Pharma shared in their Nov 5 press release on Epidiolex     European Commission approval in September 2019  Commercialization underway in France and Germany  UK NICE guidance expected in Q4 2019  Spain and Italy launches to follow in 2020  Early Access Program now includes over 1 100 patients across 5 major EU countries  and over 400 physicians from 250 top epilepsy centersThen on Nov 10  the company revealed that they received a positive NICE recommendation for EPIDYOLEX   cannabidiol  oral solution for the treatment of seizures in patients with two rare  severe forms of childhood onset epilepsy  GW said in a press release that two of its medicines  EPIDYOLEX  cannabidiol  oral solution and Sativex  nabiximols   have been recommended by the UK s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  NICE  to receive routine reimbursement from NHS England As mentioned earlier  medical financial coverage and reimbursement by national health organizations and insurance carriers is key to the growth of drugs in a new category like those derived from cannabis Analysts at SVB Leerink found this news very positive and noted  We remain confident that Epidiolex can be   1B product and believe that eventually investors will look through quarterly prints and see this opportunity  The healthcare focused investment bank reiterated their Outperform rating and  198 price target Disclosure  I own GWPH shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio  NetGearis an  800 million provider of networking and Internet connected products for broadband access and network connectivity The stock has been in and out of the cellar of the Zacks Rank since August and just got kicked down there again after their earnings report on October 23 where both revenues and profits declined year over year The outlook wasn t too bright either  which caused analysts to lower their estimates once again  Since the report three weeks ago  full year 2019 EPS projections dropped 19  from  2 27 to  1 83 and 2020 profit views fell 22  from  2 73 to  2 12 My colleague Dave Borun last wrote about NetGear as the Bear of the Day in mid August when shares were trading above  33  Here s what he had to say   It s not a great time to be in the network equipment business  The US China trade dispute threatens to increase prices for firms which are heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and a threatened global economic slowdown would mean significantly reduced demand for finished products Netgear now finds itself stuck between the proverbial rock and hard place  with planned tariffs potentially increasing the cost of its products   manufacturing of which is outsourced to several other companies  primarily in China and Vietnam   just as demand for its commercial networking equipment seems likely to wane The products Netgear makes for the home consumer market tend to sell consistently  regardless of economic conditions  but the businesses that purchase more expensive switches  network appliances and storage solutions tend to ramp up their spending during boom times and cut back sharply when times are tougher  end of excerpt from Dave Borun s August 15 article What Dave was seeing and hearing then is still true today as tariff and global growth headwinds continue to impact NetGear Since the company has sales bigger than its market cap  it may remain a value play or potential M A target But until the estimates stop going down  and start heading back up

million   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  394 6 million  indicating year over year growth of 27 8  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter bottom line is

805 billion  Notably  shares of Pure Storage have declined 16 9  on a year to date basis  against the  s rally of 3 2 Let s delve deeper and analyze the factors likely to influence the company s results in the to be reported quarter Key Factors to WatchThe company might falter in the to be reported quarter owing to multiple headwinds including intensifying competition from peers  lack of international customers and mounting losses We expect currency headwinds  and high tariffs owing to trade war between the U S  and China to weigh on revenue growth and margin expansion  Further  intense competition from fellow storage peers including NetApp   NASDAQ NTAP   is likely to create pricing pressure  which is likely to impact profitability Further  Pure Storage has been incurring operating losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of  1 18 billion as of Apr 30  2019  The company does not expect to generate profit in the near term  on account of continued investments on research   development and sales   marketing  Despite the increasing top line  mounting losses doesn t augur well for the to be reported quarter s results In a bid to sustain competitive position  Pure Storage is introducing products with updated capabilities  Increasing spend on portfolio expansion is likely to weigh on margin expansion at least in the near term  This in turn is likely to impact the upcoming quarterly results Notably  during the quarter under review  Pure Storage unveiled flash and cloud based ObjectEngine solution  The latest backup and restore storage solution is designed to enable customers to modernize data protection strategy  Additionally  ObjectEngine users can access required data in real time through a faster  secure and cost effective medium Further  the company also announced the expansion of Evergreen Storage Service  ES2    offering customers with a unified subscription model across hybrid environments Pure Storage recently also announced the buyout of Compuverde  a developer of file software solutions  The acquisition will aid Pure Storage s file abilities by offering a unified storage offering and enhance customer experience The company s first ever buyout of StorReduce remains a notable development  Management remains elated on the acquisition of StorReduce s de duplication technology  The company announced the availability of StorReduce to provide backup and speed up analytics processes for data warehouses  These initiatives are likely to aid the to be reported quarter s results Notably  Pure Storage added more than 350 customers in the last reported quarter  bringing the total base to more than 6 200 organizations  The company is rapidly gaining traction in the flash storage market  which is evident from its expanding customer base  Strength in product portfolio including the likes of FlashArray  FlashStack and FlashBlade business segments is projected to positively impact the upcoming quarterly results We believe the recent buyouts  collaboration synergies and product rollouts bode well for Pure Storage What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive   Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  are best avoided Pure Storage has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and

172709,394225,NTAP,Nikkei Declines Beneath Critical Supports  Euro Makes New Lows,opinion,"VIX rallied not only above Intermediate term resistance and mid Cycle resistance at 14 60 15 07  but also Long term resistance at 17 02  closing above it This has provided a confirmed buy signal 
   A stock market that has been scaring Wall Street for months got a lot more frightening this week as Jerome Powell and Donald Trump helped deliver the worst drop of the year and volatility surged 
Thought markets were hard to fathom back when the trade war was cooling and the Federal Reserve preparing to cut rates  Try now  with Powell  down his easing cycle and Trump  new tariffs on China  Solid jobs  couldn t stem the slide  Stocks fell all five days while the VIX rose the most since 2018 
SPX rejected at the double trendlines 




SPX fell away from the double trendlines to close beneath Short term support resistance at 2934 33 but above Intermediate term support at 2918 37 This puts SPX on a provisional sell signal  awaiting a close beneath Intermediate term support for confirmation  Point 6  remains beneath the December 26 low 

   The Federal Reserve s interest rate cut this week is not the real reason why U S  stocks are falling  The real culprit is the exuberant mood that has captured Wall Street in recent weeks  which in turn made the stock market vulnerable to a big drop  The Fed s decision was little more than the straw breaking the camel s back 

To appreciate just how exuberant that mood has become  consider the average recommended equity exposure among several dozen short term stock market timers I monitor   This average is what s reported in the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index  or HSNSI   In early July  this average reached its highest level since I began compiling the index two decades ago   84 2  
NDX falls to challenge Cycle support 





NDX declined to challenge Intermediate term support at 7654 99  closing above it A sell signal may be made beneath this level While there were a lot of newsworthy events this week  the decline was already overdue 

   A disappointing financial warning from a fairly small player in the corporate technology gear market unleashed a bloodbath among the stocks of major hardware vendors on Friday 

Silicon Valley based NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  warned on Friday morning that its sales in its quarter that just ended would be between  1 22 and  1 23 billion  or about 17  less than the same quarter a year ago  Just two months ago  the company had said it expected to bring in  1 315 billion to  1 465 billion  The company  which makes gear for storing data on corporate servers and in cloud services  also said it expected revenue for its next fiscal year would decline by 5  to 10  instead of rising by single digit percentage points as previously forecast 
High Yield Bond Index declines beneath support 





The High Yield Bond Index declined beneath Intermediate term support at 210 85giving a sell signal  The Cycles Model warns the next step down may be a large one 

   In a letter to investors dated July 25  David Einhorn revealed that Greenlight is shorting US corporate credit 

By now  the full letter is public on multiple websites and the passage that describes his position against credit is very brief  so I see no harm in quoting it verbatim  Here it is 

Additionally  we have taken a new macro position against U S  corporate credit  both investment grade and high yield  Over the last few years  corporate debt has expanded dramatically  while covenant packages and other bond holder protections have weakened considerably  Rating agencies have been complacent and allowed debt EBITDA and debt equity ratios to deteriorate without a corresponding reduction in credit ratings  Meanwhile  we are a decade into an economic recovery and there are signs the economy may be slowing 
Treasuries rallies above Cycle Top resistance 






The 10 year Treasury Note Index inverted to make a belated Master Cycle high on Friday This Cycle inversion was likely a product of the FOMC rate cut  However  the Cycle Top usually spells the end of the line for this rally  despite the probe above it Residual strength may last a few more days  but a reversal beneath the Cycle Top at 128 60 spells trouble for treasuries 

     Treasury yields plunged Thursday as traders reacted to President Donald Trump s pledge to slap further tariffs on Chinese imports  as well as soft economic data  strengthening the case for further easing of monetary policy later this year 

Investors continued to wrestle with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell s remarks from Wednesday following the U S  central bank s decision to cut rates by 25 basis points 

The 10 year Treasury note yield   fell 14 basis points to 1 894   its lowest since Nov  8  2016  The benchmark maturity marked its biggest daily decline since last May 

The euro continues making new lows 






The euro probed near the neckline to a new 2 year low ending in a possible reversal on Thursday The sell signal may be lifted as it bounces to test Intermediate term resistance at 112 35  The Cycles Model suggests a period of strength for the next week 

     The U S  dollar fell against the Japanese yen on Thursday afternoon after President Donald Trump said he would impose an additional 10  tariff on  300 billion worth of Chinese imports on Sept  1 

Trump made the announcement in a series of tweets after an American delegation returned from trade talks in Beijing  saying China had failed to deliver on its promises to buy large quantities of agricultural products from the United States  and to curb sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl 

The dollar was 1 32  weaker at 107 31 yen  after hitting a two month high overnight  The safe haven yen rose as traders moved out of riskier assets  The dollar index  DXY turned negative after Trump s remarks  last down 0 20  to 98 325

     A measure of stocks across the globe posted on Friday its largest weekly loss of the year while yields in U S  and German debt were near or at multi year lows  after China vowed to retaliate against a possible new round of U S  tariffs 

Oil prices bounced back from losses that exceeded 7  the previous session and the yen scaled further against the dollar a day after its strongest daily gain in over two years 

The moves followed a sharp Wall Street selloff triggered by U S  President Donald Trump s threat Thursday to impose a 10  tariff on  300 billion worth of Chinese imports

Nikkei declines beneath critical supports 




 
The Nikkei Index reversed course  falling beneath critical support at 21448 92 It topped just a week after its Master Cycle low on July 18 The breakdown has appeared as suggested 

    When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was re elected head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party last month  he made a familiar pledge  His government  he said  would finally beat the deflation that has plagued the country for decades 

New threats  like the escalating U S  China trade war  will make that old battle even more difficult to win  But if Abe fails  it may be because the economy s fate was sealed long before he became prime minister  when Japan  lost  a generation of workers who ought to be driving the economy today

     While gold has hit a fresh six year high against the U S  dollar  it is making even further gains another major Group of Seven currency 

Gold prices traded at all time highs in Canadian dollar terms  hitting C 1 910 40 per ounce on Friday morning 

Nicky Shiels  commodity strategist at Scotia bank  said these highs are just the latest event in an emerging theme of currency tensions 

 Gold s price in every major currency seems to be at record highs  and that is a big statement indicator that we are in the middle of some sort of currency war   she said 
Crude prices whipsaw during Fed 





Crude rallied to challenge Intermediate term resistance at 58 69 on Wednesday Then it fell to 53 59 on Thursday only to close near the halfway point for the week  The Cycles Model suggests the Broadening Wedge formation may be triggered in the next two weeks 

   The U S  oil benchmark tumbled nearly 8 percent on Thursday in its biggest one day drop in four and a half years after U S  President Donald Trump rekindled fears of significant slowdown in economies and oil demand growth by announcing he would impose tariffs on US 300 billion worth of Chinese imports

Agriculture Prices probe beneath support 





The Bloomberg Agricultural Sub index continued its decline beneath Intermediate term support at 40 17  closing the week at the lows  It may have made a Master Cycle low on Thursday However  Cycle Bottom support at 37 54 may be an attractor that could pull the index down even further next week 

   A new report from  shows US soybean exports to China collapsed in 1H19 to the lowest level in more than a decade 

The US exported 614 806 tons of soybeans to China in June  according to US customs data  That brought 1H19 China imports of soybeans from the US to 5 9 million tons  the lowest level since 2004  according to Bloomberg calculations

Shanghai Index sliding to deeper lows 




The Shanghai Index rallied  testing Intermediate term resistance on Tuesday  then declined through Short term support at 2929 87 to close near the low of the week Theperiod of strength may have been cut short by the FOMC announcement  The decline may have resumed and it may persist through late September 

   Asian markets fell in early trading Thursday  following the Fed s first interest rate cut in more than a decade 

Stocks slid on Wall Street after and failed to clearly signal whether more cuts were on the horizon 

Meanwhile  trade negotiations between the U S  and China concluded in Shanghai  with no major breakthrough  China did agree to buy more U S  agricultural products  and the White House said talks are expected to continue in Washington in September  The ongoing trade war has hurt China economy  though a report Thursday found China s factory activity improved slightly in June  though it was still in contraction

172710,394226,NTAP,Analysts Estimate NetApp  NTAP  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  40 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 23 billion  down 16 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 21 54  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NetApp 
For NetApp  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 76  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NetApp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NetApp would post earnings of  1 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 22  delivering a surprise of  2 40  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NetApp doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-netapp-ntap-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200452279,200452279

172756,394272,NTAP,3 Stocks That Flaunt Solid Earnings Acceleration,opinion,"Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth captivates all  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price 
But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement 
Future Outperformers
So  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration 
In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 
Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down 
Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 
The Winning Strategy
Let s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 
EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  
EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  
EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3

172757,394273,NTAP,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Lexicon  Medtronic And NetApp,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 8  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Lexicon Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ LXRX    Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT   and NetApp  Inc    NASDAQ NTAP   3 Stocks that Flaunt Solid Earnings AccelerationTake a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth captivates all  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement Future OutperformersSo  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance

172780,394296,NTAP,Why NetApp  NTAP  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP   which belongs to the Zacks Computer  Storage Devices industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This data storage company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 18 54  
For the most recent quarter  NetApp was expected to post earnings of  0 99 per share  but it reported  1 06 per share instead  representing a surprise of 7 07   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 80 per share  while it actually produced  1 04 per share  a surprise of 30  
Price and EPS Surprise

For NetApp  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
NetApp currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 15   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 13  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-netapp-ntap-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200377180,200377180

172868,394384,NTAP,NetApp  NTAP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 14  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 99 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 51 billion  up 6 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 34  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NetApp 
For NetApp  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 83  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that NetApp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NetApp would post earnings of  0 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 04  delivering a surprise of  30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NetApp appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/netapp-ntap-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200356266,200356266

172913,394429,NTAP,WDC Or NTAP  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Computer  Storage Devices sector might want to consider either Western Digital  WDC  or NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Both Western Digital and NetApp have a Zacks Rank of   1  Strong Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
WDC currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 95  while NTAP has a forward P E of 21 72  We also note that WDC has a PEG ratio of 0 31  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  NTAP currently has a PEG ratio of 1 81 
Another notable valuation metric for WDC is its P B ratio of 2 10  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  NTAP has a P B of 9 81 
Based on these metrics and many more  WDC holds a Value grade of A  while NTAP has a Value grade of C 
Both WDC and NTAP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that WDC is the superior value option right now ",2018-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wdc-or-ntap-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200327531,200327531

NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  had a strong run higher following trend support from September 2017 until now  The last 3 weeks it has consolidated against resistance just under 80 and above the 20 day SMA  The Bollinger Bands  are squeezing in  often a precursor to a move  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone with the MACD turning back up  a bullish signal  The price is extended from the trend support so it is a risk of a pullback 
But there is a strong trend with a Measured Move higher to 91 on a break to the upside  There is no resistance over 79 25 and support lower comes at 76 30 and 72 85 then 69 75 and 66 35 before 64  Short interest is moderate at 5 2   The company is expected to report earnings next on August 15th  It also pays a 40 cent dividend  a 2  yield  and trades ex dividend July 5th

Trade Idea 4  Buy the July 79 84 Call Spread   1 33  and sell the July 75 Put for 56 cents 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which as we close the books on the 2nd Quarter and prepare for a holiday shortened 4th of July week  sees that the equity markets look to have run out of gas  Maybe the short week will re energize them  All there indexes had a positive quarter with the IWM just out pacing the QQQ  7 9  to 6 5  and the SPY gaining 3 1   The QQQ won the month up 0 9  to the 0 6  for the IWM and the SPY eked out a 0 1  gain  The monthly candles all look toppy with long upper shadows  while the quarterly candles are all looking strong 
Elsewhere Gold looks as it may pause in its downtrend while Crude Oil continues to race higher  The US Dollar Index is pausing in its uptrend while Treasuries are on the edge of a break out to the upside  The Shanghai Composite may be ready to pause in its downtrend while Emerging Markets are setting up for a possible reversal higher  Volatility looks to remain low but above recent levels keeping the wind at the backs of the equity markets but the breeze blowing softer 
The equity index ETFs SPY  IWM and QQQ  all had a mixed week with early signs of strength Friday fading into the close  leaving questions about the short term  The longer weekly time frame was much less troublesome showing consolidation for the SPY continuing and the IWM and QQQ digesting recent moves higher  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

172927,394443,NTAP,Anatomy Of Success  NetApp  NTAP ,opinion,"The Zacks Rank methodology is a unique way to discover some of the best companies to invest in and is a useful tool for beginners and more experienced investors alike  it identifies companies both big and small that have the right characteristics to produce superior gains 
When a company earns that coveted Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  label  its means they have a high probability of outperforming the market over the next one to three months  But  achieving this high rank is not an easy thing to do  as only 5  of companies within the Zacks Rank universe earn this position 
Below  we highlight a stock that has evolved into a strong player in the broad cloud industry  and by following our ranking system  investors could have realized major gains 
NetApp Inc  NASDAQ NTAP    NTAP 
Headquartered in Sunnyvale  CA  NetApp provides a full range of hybrid cloud data services that simplify application management and data across the cloud and on premise environments to accelerate digital transformation  Together with their partners  they empower global organizations to unleash the full potential of their data to expand customer touchpoints  foster greater innovation  and optimize their operations 
NTAP was added to the Strong Buy list for the first time in late November of last year after the tech company reported better than expected second quarter fiscal 2018 results  Earnings of 81 cents per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while revenues of  1 42 billion grew 6  year over year  Product revenue increased 14  from the prior year period  and NetApp said that all flash array annualized net revenue run rate of  1 7 billion increased 58  year over year  Shares closed that initial November trading day at  56 41 
The stock kept up its  1 run until well into January and was made a Strong Buy stock again on April 20  This was most likely due to analyst bullishness as the company headed into its fourth earnings report  as well as the lingering effects of impressive Q3 results  During the third quarter  net revenues grew 8  year over year  earnings beat our estimate  and guidance was positive and above what analysts were expecting  Six months after first becoming a Zacks Rank  1  shares of NTAP were up almost 22  to  68 66 
NTAP held onto the  1 rank for another good run  thanks to a strong Q4 performance  Both its top and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus  with net revenues increasing 11  year over year  2018 product revenue jumped 15  from 2017  And  free cash flow was 23  for the year and increased 64  year over year 
As a result  the stock was given the Strong Buy title once again on June 1 and has been able to hold on to that rank ever since  Eight months after first becoming a Zacks Rank  1  shares of NTAP grew 24  to  69 71  Additionally  shares of the cloud company are up around 70  in the past one year period 
This table shows the price performance of NTAP  in red   as well as the 12 month forward looking EPS estimate  in green  over the last one year  During this stretch  NTAP never moved lower than a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

By utilizing the Zacks Rank  investors are able to easily identify elite stocks that are best positioned to beat the market on a consistent basis  and how to hold those top stocks as they continue to grow

173156,394672,NTAP,Is NetApp  NTAP  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NetApp  Inc    NASDAQ NTAP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NetApp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 23 06  This level compares somewhat favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 27 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts NetApp s current PE slightly among its highs over the observed period  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE compares slightly higher than the Zacks classified Computer and Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 92  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is slightly overvalued right now  compared to its peers PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  NetApp has a P S ratio of about 2 13  This is lower than the Zacks categorized Computer and Technology sector average  which comes in at 3 08 right now Notably  NTAP is actually towards the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  NetApp currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NetApp a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the EV EBITDA for Ford is just 9 08  a level that is slightly lower than the sector average of 9 53  The EV EBITDA multiple  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  is capital structure neutral  as it takes into account the level of debt on a company s balance sheet  not just its equity  Clearly  NTAP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though NetApp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives DST a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately  The current quarter has seen 10 estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has also seen 10 upward revisions and no downward revision in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has jumped 13 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has moved north by nearly 11   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NetApp  Inc  Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and the company s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineNetApp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front The company forms a part of the Zacks classified Computer   Storage Devices industry which has a strong industry rank  among the Top 25  out of more than 250 industries   We believe that the company s recent product launches and growing portfolio based on SolidFire acquisition will drive top line growth  going ahead  Meanwhile  cost reduction initiatives will facilitate margin expansion over the long run Notably  over the past year  the Zacks categorized Computer   Storage Devices industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for price to correct downwards a bit first  but once that happens  fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best recommendations and most in depth research are not available to the

173157,394673,NTAP,NetApp  NTAP  Beats On Q4 Earnings   Revenues  View Tepid,opinion,"NetApp Inc    NASDAQ NTAP   reported fourth quarter fiscal 2017 non GAAP earnings  including stock based compensation  of 72 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents Earnings  excluding stock based compensation  surged 56 4  from the year ago quarter and almost 5  sequentially to 86 cents  The figure was better than management s guided range of 79 84 cents per share  The upside was primarily driven by strong top line growth along with margin expansion Revenues increased 7 3  from the year ago quarter and 5 5  from the previous quarter to  1 48 billion  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 44 billion  The figure was within management s guided range of  1 365  1 515 billion However  first quarter fiscal 2018 guidance was unimpressive due to seasonality  We believe that this will keep the share price under pressure  Notably  NetApp has return 12 1  as compared with S P 500 s gained of 7 7  on a year to date basis 
In Line SolidFire Revenue  Lower Costs Drove FY17 ResultsIn fiscal 2017  revenues declined almost 0 5  over fiscal 2016 to  5 52 billion  However  management noted revenue contribution from SolidFire was in line with expectation but was significantly less dilutive to overall operating results  This positively impacted profitability Earnings surged 28 2  to  2 73 per share driven by improving operating margins  which reflected benefits from lower costs  NetApp stated that it  overachieved  its goal of delivering a net run rate savings of almost  130 million in operating expenses and cost of sales 
NetApp  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Further  the company returned over  900 million to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends  The company is increasing quarterly dividend payout by 5  to 20 cents per share Robust Strategic Solutions Drove Q4 RevenuesProduct revenues  57 5  of total revenue  increased 12 5  year over year and 8 7  sequentially to  852 million  Strategic solutions comprised 70  of net product revenues and increased 23 9  on a year over year basis and 16 4  sequentially However  mature solutions revenues declined 7 2  from the year ago quarter and 5 9  sequentially  NetApp anticipates headwinds impacting mature solutions revenues to decrease over rest of the fiscal year Software Maintenance revenues  16 3  of total revenue  increased 3 4  from the year ago quarter and 0 8  from previous quarter to  242 million Revenues from Hardware Maintenance   Other Services  26 1  of total revenue  dropped 0 5  year over year but increased 1 8  quarter over quarter to  387 million  The revenue decline can primarily be attributed to lower hardware maintenance support contract revenues NetApp noted that in the quarter Clustered ONTAP was deployed in over 95  of FAS systems shipped  Moreover  Clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 50  of systems in that large and growing install base Further  NetApp noted that all flash array business soared 140  year over year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost  1 7 billion  We note that the company continues to gain market share against the likes of Hewlett Packard   NYSE HPE   and EMC  NYSE EMC   now acquired by Dell  Lower Costs Boost MarginsNon GAAP gross margin  including stock based compensation  was 62 2   Gross margin  excluding stock based compensation  was 62 5   which was better than management s guided range of 60 62  Gross margin expanded 140 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter and 100 bps sequentially  on the back of higher product gross margin  up 210 bps from the year ago quarter and 320 bps sequentially  which reflected improving sales discipline  fewer promotions and lower reserves Software maintenance gross margin expanded 40 bps sequentially and 130 bps on a year over year basis  Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased 240 bps on a year over year basis  reflecting the benefits from its transformation initiatives  However  hardware maintenance and other services gross margin declined 130 bps sequentially Non GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased 30 bps from the year ago quarter and 40 bps sequentially due to higher variable compensation expense Consequently  non GAAP operating margin  including stock based compensation  expanded 860 bps on a year over year basis and 60 bps on a sequential basis to 17 6   Operating margin  excluding stock based compensation  was 20 7   much better than management s guided range of 18 5 19 5  Liquidity Improves  Share Buyback ContinuesNetApp exited the quarter with cash  cash equivalents and investments of  4 92 billion  as compared with  4 64 billion at the end of previous quarter  The company has a long term debt balance of  744 million The company generated cash from operations of  365 million during the quarter  compared with  235 million in the previous quarter  Further  the company repurchased shares worth  129 million and paid  51 million as dividends in the reported quarter Guidance Consistent with Long Term ViewFor first quarter fiscal 2018  NetApp expects non GAAP earnings in the range of 49 57 cents per share  which reflects 15  growth year over year at the midpoint  The guidance is consistent with the company s historical first quarter results and long term model of low double digit earnings growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at 50 cents Net revenues are anticipated to be in the range of  1 24  1 39 billion  which implies 2  growth from the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  1 31 billion NetApp expect gross margin in the range of 62 63  and operating margin between 13 5  and 14 5  for the first quarter  which is the company s seasonally weak quarter due to higher anticipated operating expenses For fiscal 2018  NetApp expects moderate revenue growth  Gross margin is anticipated to be in the range of 62 63  and operating margin in the range of 18 20   The company expects to deliver low double digit earnings growth and anticipates free cash flow in the range of 17 19  of revenues NetApp is now focused on expanding its total addressable market  TAM  by growing product portfolio and strengthening its dominant position in all flash arrays and converged infrastructure markets  Management anticipates continuing penetration into Tier 1 SAN market  which will drive top line growth Moreover  launch of the ACI solution as well as new cloud services and partnerships along with reinvigorating the OEM program will boost results Further  NetApp anticipates continued operating margin improvement despite higher investments on business due to improving productivity  Additionally  the capital allocation program will continue to drive profitability in the long haul Zacks Rank   Key PicksNetApp carries a Zacks Rank  3  Strong Buy   Quantum Corp   NYSE QTM   and Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC   are two stocks worth looking in the sector  as both of them sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Long term earnings growth rate for Quantum and Western Digital are pegged at 20  and 4 75   respectively

173181,394697,NTAP,Fantas,opinion,"Some investors look at the more than 1 3  plunge in the NASDAQ on Thursday as a reason to abandon tech  while others see it as an amazing opportunity to capitalize on an overdone rotation  You can count the editors in the latter camp 
Today  we saw RTA and Tactical Trader increase positions on existing tech holdings  while Surprise Trader sold tech shares for double digit returns but still held onto half of the positions  And Zacks Counterstrike sold a few names to  raise some cash to have some buying power when we are ready to jump in   They re getting prepared for the rebound  see more in the highlights section  
In the session  NASDAQ dropped by 1 36  to 5251 1  while Russell 2000 was off 0 65  to 1313 8  But in classic rotation style  the Dow was up 0 36  to 19 191 9 and the S P slipped only 0 35  to 2191 1 A Couple Winners for Surprise Trader
  The Surprise Trader took profits from three positions on Thursday and two of them were for double digit returns  The tech panic was in full swing on Thursday  so Eric decided to lock in some gains with Nvidia  NVDA   The editor sold half of the position for a profit of 24 8   The portfolio also got a nice return with Halliburton  NYSE HAL   which has skyrocketed since the OPEC announcement  Before the euphoria fades  the editor halved this position too for 14   Finally  the portfolio sold all of Quintiles  Q  after the stop loss was hit this morning  It brought in 5  Today s Portfolio Highlights 
  If you believe that the economy is expanding  then today s stiff rotation out of tech is opening some very nice opportunities  It just so happens that Steve does believe the economy is on solid ground  so today he added a 7  allocation in NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  for Reitmeister Trading Alert  NTAP is a computer storage company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  status and a Zacks Style Score of  B  for Value  He also decided to add more shares of the fabless semiconductor company Cirrus Logic  CRUS  
In other news  RTA picked up more shares of Boyd Gaming  BYD  and brought the allocation up to 7 2   Steve believes this company is set for explosive earnings growth  so today s dip in price is a great chance for the editor to add more shares to one of his  best picks for 2017   The complete commentary has more info on all of today s moves 
  As today s  tech wreck  unfolded  Kevin Cook saw the opportunity to add to his position in a volatile stock that was once the best performing IPO of 2016    and could still finish that way  He doubled the allocation in Acacia Communications  ACIA  for the Tactical Trader and believes that a re test of the November lows near  62 will bring fundamental investors back into this maker of optical networking products  Read the complete commentary for more on this new addition

173183,394699,NTAP,Western Digital  WDC  Stock Rises On Upbeat Q2 Guidance,opinion,Shares of Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ WDC   jumped 8 3  during yesterday s trade after the world s leading hard disk drive  HDD  manufacturer raised its forthcoming quarter s outlook  The renewal of cross license agreement with Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co  Ltd  also boosted investors  confidence in the stock Revised View for the Second QuarterThe company now anticipates second quarter fiscal 2017 revenues to be approximately  4 75 billion  Earlier  Western Digital had projected revenues to remain flat sequentially at  4 7 billion  The revised revenue guidance is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 71 billion Similarly  non GAAP gross margin forecast has been raised to 36  from its earlier anticipation of 35   Non GAAP tax rate is now projected to be approximately 13  compared with the previous guidance range of 14  to 16  However  Western Digital has kept its non GAAP operating and net interest expenses guidance unchanged at  805 million and  205 million  respectively Considering the aforementioned changes in its second quarter outlook  the company raised its projected non GAAP earnings per share range to  2 10    2 15 from the earlier guided range of  1 85    1 95  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 45  which will definitely see an upward revision in the coming days According to the company  the upbeat top and bottom line guidance is a result of favourable product mix  continued strong acceptance of its products  solid sales execution and favourable market conditions  Apart from this  the company also renewed an 8 year cross license patent agreement with Samsung yesterday  which the company believes will also positively impact its forthcoming quarterly results Renewed Agreement with SamsungConcurrent with an update on its second quarter outlook  the company announced a definitive royalty bearing agreement with Samsung to renew the cross license patent deal with a retrospective date of Aug 14  2016  the day when the company s previous agreement expired  Per Western Digital   The agreement includes rights to each party s patents broadly covering multi level cell flash memory and flash storage systems  Bottom LineWe believe that the company s acquisition of SanDisk in May this year along with the recent agreement renewal with Samsung will continue to benefit its top and bottom line results  This is reflected in its last few quarterly results  Notably  since its completion of SanDisk s acquisition  Western Digital has reported back to back quarters of better than expected results Notably  the stock has delivered three positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 5 87   Moreover  over the last 60 days  estimates have moved upward for the current quarter as well as fiscal 2017 WESTERN DIGITAL Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Furthermore  in the last six

The US Dollar Index  which has been performing strongly since Trump s election  received an additional boost yesterday on better than expected October US retail sales  It s currently at 100 34 

The USD hasn t broken 100 45 since 2015  but  should it break that level  it could signal that the two year sideways trend in the currency has ended  and that a move to 102  which hasn t occurred since April  2003  is possible

Oil prices pushed higher yesterday on expectations of falling shale output and renewed optimism of OPEC production cuts  An attack on a major Nigerian pipeline have also contributed to the move  Crude is currently trading at  45 41  Brent is  46 65

Stocks
Two major tech companies report earnings after the close today 
Tech pioneer Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  reports Q1 2017 earnings  with expected EPS of  0 59 on  12 65 billion in revenue  Though this represents a slight YoY decline  Cisco has beaten expectations in eight of the past nine quarters  Longer term  the major concern for Cisco is whether it can expand its software revenues  Cisco s core business remains hardware  switches and routers  which account for 45  of the company s revenue  Recently  however  that market has stagnated 
Potential growth areas for the tech giant collaboration  which includes cloud  video and conferencing services   wireless  and security representing 9   5   and 4  of total respective revenues  did not increase significantly in 2016  Remaining revenue derives mostly from services  This past quarter Cisco cut its workforce by 7   Investors will want to see how Cisco plans to reinvest those savings  Additionally  if Cisco brings back some of its overseas cash at the discounted tax rates that Trump has promised corporations in order to get them to repatriate assets back to the US  higher dividend payouts might be on the horizon 
Storage and data management company NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  reports Q2 2017 earnings  with expected EPS of  0 54 on revenues of  1 43 billion  Netapp has consistently missed revenue forecasts for the previous nine consecutive quarters  The rise of cloud computing has damaged NetApp s data center storage hardware business 
The company recently announced plans to cut 6  of its workforce  this on the heels of a 12  staff reduction already announced earlier this year  Investors will be interested to see whether the cost cutting is merely a way to enhance the company s bottom line in the short term  or if it will help streamline operations in order to enhance future growth  The big question for NTAP is far more crucial  however  and speaks to its current core competence  will the rise of cloud computing kill the company s data storage business  NTAP is making a concerted effort to become the go to player in flash storage technology  a burgeoning market  and last year they purchased SolidFire  and its cloud capable all flash systems for  870 million ",2016-11-16,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/opening-bell:-oil-surge-pushes-markets-higher-200164889,200164889
173219,394735,NTAP,Par For The Course  Global Week Ahead,opinion,I think globally to start each week  Do you  Follow me on Twitter  johnblank100September s U S  Dept  of Labor jobs report hits markets on Friday  As usual  this report is the dominant trading event to this Global Week Ahead  Economists forecast a Sept  gain of  160K jobs and a U S  unemployment rate of 4 8  Each month  jobs remain core to any U S  macro fundamental update  These particular September job numbers arrive in front of the U S  presidential election held on Nov  9th  On top of that  recent U S  Fed minutes indicated the FOMC could vote short term rates up 25 basis points on Dec 14th   That means this  we have one more monthly jobs report  on Nov  4th  before the presidential election hits  and 2 monthly jobs reports before a data dependent Fed makes its final call for 2016 In 9 months of 2016  U S  jobs readings averaged  182K a month  That s slower than 2015 s  229K  However  it s ample  This durably supports readings of  2  real U S  GDP growth  Below  150K   a level that roughly eats up annual growth in the 160 million U S  civilian labor force    is where economists begin to worry out loud What other effects come with  182K a month in U S  job adds The 4 9  U S  unemployment rate goes sideways    or very slowly ticks down    at this rate of labor demand  America started 2016 at a 4 9  rate  The healthy 4 9  status of the entire U S  hiring system has put decent  2 4  annual wage gains into hourly U S  paychecks in 2016  Finally  a solid number of discouraged U S  job seekers got drawn back into the workforce   We have seen single digit annual stock index returns in this environment  That s a subdued scene for equities    in annual terms    but consistent with modest gains seen in annual payroll reports  Don t expect more than you can ask for If you are a par golfer  and hit a par on the latest hole  then you can safely say you are holding your own  You are also certainly not going to get a surprise phone call to play in the next Ryder Cup The same can be said for the U S  economy and stocks Fresh Zacks  1 Rank stocks  1  Tyson Foods   NYSE TSN   is a U S  poultry producer

fact  this was the largest rise since the final three months of 2015  read    The impressive rally was driven by better than expected earnings reports  higher oil prices and a more accommodative Fed

173279,394795,NTAP,5 Stock Picks With Exciting Relative Price Strength,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on the fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current

173295,394811,NTAP,NVIDIA  DaVita HealthCare Partners  Cisco Systems  L Brands And NetApp Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   August 18  2016    highlights NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA     as the Bull of the Day and  DaVita HealthCare Partners    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO      L Brands  NYSE LB     and NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP      

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

NVIDIA    became a Zacks  1 Rank Strong Buy in January when shares were trading under  30  Since then  the stock has more than doubled and rising earnings estimates have the name back to a  1 again after a strong Q2 earnings report on August 11 

NVIDIA designs  develops and markets a top to bottom family of award winning 3D graphics processors  graphics processing units and related software that set the standard for performance  quality and features for every type of desktop personal computer user  from professional workstations to low cost computers 

NVIDIA s 3D graphics processors are well known in the video game industry  but the company has been steadily making inroads into virtual reality  education applications and machine learning technology like that for autonomous driving 

I last wrote about NVDA as our Bull of the Day on January 4 and here s what I said   

NVIDIA was the top performing large cap semiconductor stock of the fourth quarter  with a stunning 60   move higher since their Q2 earnings report in early August  

And tonight at the International Consumer Electronics Show  CES  in Las Vegas  the company is likely to reveal further insights into their plans to stay hot on technology investor radars in 2016  In fact  they announced on New Year s Eve that they plan to unveil new technology for self driving cars  

Firing On All Frontiers

NVIDIA reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 31 of  1 43 billion  up 9  sequentially and up 24  from  1 15 billion a year earlier  This was above the company s original guidance range of  1 35 billion     2  

GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were  0 40  compared with  0 05 a year ago and up 21  from  0 33 in the previous quarter 

The company saw growth across all platforms and noted the strong launch of Pascal based GPUs and growing demand for deep learning applications  Gaming and professional graphics were the leaders  while datacenter and automotive also contributed to growth in the July quarter 

  



DaVita HealthCare Partners    became a Zacks  4 Rank Sell in mid July as analysts began lowering estimates before the company s Q2 report 

On August 8 the company delivered a 3  EPS beat but disappointed with lowered guidance for the year due to difficulties with a recent acquisition 

Since the report  shares have tumbled 13  and most analysts have moved their estimates down again  pushing the stock into the cellar of the Zacks Rank 

The Business of Dialysis

DaVita HealthCare Partners is the second largest US provider of dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure and end stage renal disease  They serve roughly 180 000 patients through a network of 2 179 owned and managed dialysis facilities 

The company offers outpatient  home based  and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services  ESRD laboratory services and provides management and administrative services to outpatient dialysis centers 

DaVita had revenues of  13 78 billion in 2015 and trailing 12 month  TTM  sales are at  14 36 billion as of June 30  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc   formerly known as DaVita Inc   is headquartered in Denver  Colorado  With the acquisition of HealthCare Partners  HCP   the company became the largest operator of medical groups and physician networks in the US 

The Quarter Analysts Saw Coming    Mostly

Total revenue increased 8 8  year over year to approximately  3 72 billion and narrowly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 2   The year over year improvement was mainly attributable to a rise in patient service revenues 

Analysts knew that the HealthCare Partners acquisition was not going according to management s plans  That s why they were lowering estimates in July  But they weren t expecting a  70 million drop in segment guidance 

Here s how analysts at Raymond James broke down the news   

Drivers behind HCP s lowered 2016 guidance include  1  fee for service revenue growth of 3  vs  management 6  target  2  an overestimation of Medicare Advantage reconciliation payments  3  Medicare Advantage mentorship growth lower than expected and  4  an acceleration in the re branding of HCP to the DaVita Medical Group    5  10 million more than expected

NTAP Technical Analysis
NTAP opened trading yesterday at  29 00  which was up from the previous days trading of  28 95  NTAP closed trading yesterday at  28 85 and spiked up after market to  31 00  equivalent to a 8  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time NTAP traded above these levels was on December 8th  2015 when it traded at  31 08  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that NTAP had been in a upward trend dating back to June 27th when it traded at  22 96  NTAP has a float of 279 76 million shares and traded 1 27 times the normal daily trading volume on Wednesday  For trading purposes  I would like to see NTAP open trading on Thursday above  30 25 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 25 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up
