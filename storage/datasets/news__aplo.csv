Investors may get some clues to Friday s nonfarm payrolls report when ADP jobs report and weekly jobless claims come out later in the session 
The private ADP payrolls report due at 12 15GMT  or 8 15AM ET  is expected to show the addition of 159 000 jobs in June 
Weekly jobless claims  due at 12 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET  are expected to rise by 2 000 last week to 270 000 
A further weakness in hiring could be an indication that the Federal Reserve  Fed  may not raise interest rates anytime soon amid the economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote 
In the run up to the July 26 27 monetary policy meeting  investors will be keeping a close eye on the data to try to determine whether the Fed will take a dovish or hawkish stance 
According to the minutes of the Fed s June policy meeting released on Wednesday  policymakers agreed that it was  prudent to wait for additional data regarding labor market conditions as well as information that would allow them to assess the consequences of the U K  vote for global financial conditions and the U S  economic outlook  
While Friday s June jobs report will clearly be key in determining the employment picture stateside after the prior month s weak job creation  the minutes gave relatively little indication on exactly what data needs to improve or how long the monetary authority will need to wait before determining the extent of the Brexit impact on the U S  economy 
Meanwhile  oil prices rallied on Thursday  extending overnight gains  amid speculation weekly supply data due later in the session will show U S  crude inventories fell at a faster pace than expected last week

On Thursday  the U S  Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 15 00GMT  or 11 00AM ET  amid expectations for a drop of 2 3 million barrels 
The reports come out one day later than usual due to the Independence Day holiday in the U S  on Monday

Weekly jobless claims also gave a positive read as the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U S  last week registered an unexpected decline 
The upbeat read of the U S  labor market arrived just before Friday s release of the June employment report 
After May s weak reading  the jobs report will be key among a series of data points being eyed by markets to determine if the Federal Reserve  Fed  will be more likely to take a dovish or hawkish stance at its July 26 27 meeting 
According to the minutes of the Fed s June policy meeting released on Wednesday  policymakers agreed that it was  prudent to wait for additional data regarding labor market conditions as well as information that would allow them to assess the consequences of the U K  vote for global financial conditions and the U S  economic outlook

 NEW YORK  June 2  Reuters    U S  stocks were little
changed on Thursday  a day after suffering their biggest losses
in nearly a year  as a slight improvement in weekly jobless
claims failed to impress and chain store sales were
lackluster 
 Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped
6 000 to a seasonally adjusted 422 000  while economists polled
by Reuters forecast 415 000  For details  see  ID nN02246578 
  We ve been through a couple week period here where
basically every piece of economic data has just been awful 
This was a little less awful  but still awful   said John
Canally  investment strategist and economist for LPL Financial
in Boston 
  Although the big news really is tomorrow s jobs report  so
 claims  is really just a preview of that  
 Investors seemed reluctant to make big bets ahead of the
non farm payrolls data Friday  which is expected to show
150 000 jobs were added in May  according to a Thomson Reuters
poll of economists 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  dropped 8 97
points  or 0 07 percent  to 12 281 17  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  added 0 52 points  or 0 04 percent  to
1 315 07  The Nasdaq Composite Index  gained 10 46
points  or 0 38 percent  to 2 779 65 
 The benchmark S P appeared to be holding the 100 day moving
average  a level some analysts suggested as a support level

 NEW YORK  June 2  Reuters    U S  stocks rebounded from
early lows but struggled to find direction on Thursday as news
of fresh help for Greece calmed investors worried about the
economic outlook ahead of a key jobs report 
 Senior euro zone officials tentatively agreed on a new
three year adjustment plan for Greece  according to a source 
The S P 500 recouped some lost ground on the news after earlier
taking out its May low at 1 311 80  For details  see

  Markets are focused on two  Es  right now  Europe and
employment  and if there s stability in those  that will lead
to greater market confidence   said Tom Galvin  managing
director and lead portfolio manager at Columbia Management in
Stamford  Connecticut 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 25 05
points  or 0 20 percent  at 12 265 09  The Standard   Poor s

1 313 78  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 2 79
points  or 0 10 percent  at 2 771 98 
 Nervous investors focused on key market levels to manage
risk ahead of Friday s non farm payroll report  Data showing
stubbornly high jobless claims and mixed chain store sales gave
investors little reason to get back into the market after a
string of weak economic data sparked equities  worst one day
fall in nearly a year on Wednesday 
 Traders are honing in on the May low as near term support 
If that level is broken at the close  it could open the window
to a move back to the April low at 1 294  and the March lows
near 1 250 to 1 260  the index s 200 day moving average 
  The market is trying to stabilize from the whiplash we had
yesterday  but we need to see further gains in employment to
see a move in the market out of this range   Galvin said 
 Initial jobless claims slipped 6 000 to a seasonally
adjusted 422 000 in the latest week  while economists polled by
Reuters had forecast 415 000   ID nN02246578 
 Friday s non farm payroll report is expected to show
150 000 jobs added in May  according to a Thomson Reuters poll
of economists  A weak read by ADP on private employers on
Wednesday prompted many analysts to sharply scale back their
forecasts 
 Bank stocks stabilized after falling on news that Goldman
Sachs Group Inc  was subpoenaed by New York prosecutors
seeking information on its role leading into the global
financial crisis  Goldman s stock fell 1 4 percent to  134 26 
while the KBW Banks index  rose 0 4 percent after falling
earlier   ID nN02257268 
 Moody s Investors Service said there was a small but rising
risk of a short lived default by the United States if the
government s statutory debt limit was not increased in coming
weeks  As the risk was not seen as large  equities had little
reaction to the announcement   ID nN02274698 
 Retailers reported growth in May same store sales  though
the growth was less robust than expected as consumers were hit
by high gasoline prices  Gap Inc  fell 3 3 percent to
 18 28  while Costco Wholesale Corp  lost 1 percent to
 79 40  Luxury retailer Tiffany   Co  rose 0 5 percent
to  73 79   ID nN02231116 
  There were some decent retail results  especially at the
high end  which suggests that the consumer is by no means in a
foxhole   Galvin said 
 Strength in education stocks supported the Nasdaq after
U S  officials relaxed rules that could have cut off tuition
aid to programs run by for profit colleges   ID nL3E7H21RM 
 Corinthian Colleges Inc  surged 27 percent to

4619,226134,APLO,Fed Fears Keep Investors On Edge,opinion,"Popularity is the crown of laurel which the world puts on bad art  Whatever is popular is wrong  Oscar Wilde

As a parent of a young child in her formative years  one often gets the opportunity to hear about who is popular at school  and naturally  who is not  When you are growing up  feeling wanted and accepted is a natural desire  As one acquires more life experience  a few wrinkles under the eyes  call it seasoning  the importance of popularity can start to slowly drop towards the bottom on the priority list  For many people  it may be at the bottom at a far earlier age  How one approaches popularity is a subjective and personal perspective  The concept of popularity is also quite important in financial markets  especially in the stock market  Institutional investors are often known as lemmings  flocking in mass to the securities which are performing well  On the opposite side of the equation  the  me too  type attitude can be found on the long list of losers which are shunned by the big money crowd  After all  the best must only be associated with only successful companies  right  Uh  no 
In the current market environment  there are plenty of areas and individual stocks which are out of favor  hated  unloved  shunned  or tainted with the scarlet letter  Retail and luxury head the list of the unpopular as you can take your pick of which specific company is despised the most  Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  did not help the cause any when it posted results this week which disappointed on the top line  Investors also continue to fret about the  Will they  Won t they  Federal Reserve decision of potentially raising interest rates in June  Stronger economic results  inflation readings  and hawkish comments from board members have also increased the tension in the market  My own personal view is the status quo  as it has been for a long time  Mrs  Yellen leans dovish  has shown no inclination not to lean dovish  and was weaned on the feet of Mr  Bernanke  better known as  helicopter Ben   The fact annualized inflation might be 1 9812 versus the estimated 1 9810 is not going to cause a rush to raise  at least from my perspective anyway  Keep in mind my view is the popular one  but according to Mr  Wilde  it is often incorrect 
Earnings reports continued to trickle in as retailers L Brands  NYSE LB  and the Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  added to the dour sentiment across the landscape  although Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT  showed a glimmer of hope with a nice surprise  In technology  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  reported a good result and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  bolstered the sector with a good number on Thursday after the bell  Oil continues its march higher with different one time supply events holding back production in Canada  Nigeria  and now potentially Venezuela  Some observers believe the economic environment is so bad there oil production is going to retreat  Don t tell Hillary or Bernie  but when you have too much government control over critical industries  eventually the corruption starts to affect how the business is being run  In combination with the dramatic cut of employed oil rigs in the shale areas of North America  at some point global production should fall  especially if the OPEC countries cannot make it up  It may take until the end of the year  but if demand stays solid across the emerging markets  black gold might become even more interesting as the year winds down  Closer to home  literally  it appears Leon Black and the Apollo Group Inc  NASDAQ APOL  are trying to work out an agreement with Caesars Palace  NASDAQ CZR  creditors to arrange a recapitalization of the debt laden monster which has been holed up in the bankruptcy courts for what seems like forever  Second line creditors like Apaloosa s David Tepper are the holdup to an agreement  Summer approaches and the hot weather requires a cold drink  a good book  and an afternoon nap

4636,226151,APLO,US STOCKS Futures flat to higher as data awaited later in week,news,"NEW YORK  June 29  Reuters    U S  stock futures were flat
to higher on Monday as investors looked to new data later in
the holiday shortened week for clues over the direction of the
recession hit economy 
   U S  stocks have run up as much as 40 percent since early
March but have drifted recently as investors looked for signs
to justify earlier optimism over an economic economy that
partly drove the rally 
    The focus will be on the economic data in this
abbreviated week   said Peter Cardillo  chief market economist
at Avalon Partner in New York   What we are going to see is a
market that is going to respond to the economic data  numbers
that should continue to indicate improvement  
   The main focus later this week will be the June jobs
report set for Thursday instead of Friday  when U S  markets
will be closed due to the U S  Independence Day holiday 
   Other key economic data will include the Conference
Board s June consumer confidence report and the Chicago
Purchasing Managers Index of June business activity in the U S 
Midwest  both due Tuesday  as well as the Institute for Supply
Management June reading on manufacturing set for Wednesday 
   S P 500 futures rose 2 80 points and were above fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 30
points  and Nasdaq 100 futures added 6 25 points 
   Cardillo noted the market may also be affected by
end of quarter  window dressing  as portfolio managers sell
stocks with big losses and buy some of the quarter s
best performing issues to help improve their returns  a process
that can add to volatility 
   With corporate earnings and economic data calendars
virtually free of any market moving events on Monday  the
sentencing of confessed swindler Bernard Madoff will be in the
spotlight 
   At a court hearing due to begin at 10 a m  EDT  U S 
District Judge Denny Chin is expected by legal observers to
sentence Madoff  71  to what would effectively be a life term
in prison

Heron Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ HRTX   one of our prior swing trades  ran up a little bit  pulled back and consolidated for three or four weeks  and broke out again on Monday  up 3 00 to 38 46  or 8 5   on 2 3 million shares  Right now  it looks like it s in run mode  The target is 42 1 2 3 4  Beyond that  this stock could reach up to the mid to high 50 s 
Tantech Holdings Ltd  NASDAQ TANH  has been beautiful  It s had at least 6 waves up  possibly 7  and it broke out again on Monday  up 1 18 to 31 09  or 4   on 231 800 shares traded  It s been up 5 consecutive days  and I m looking for it to head up toward 40  which is the target on this one if it doesn t pull back and retest first 
Stocks on the Short Side   
Cimpress N V   NASDAQ CMPR  is looking ugly  After the top broke  and it formed a massive pattern  it dropped back another 3 48 to 69 98  or nearly 5   on a little over a half million shares on Monday  It seems to be indicating that it wants to go lower  testing 60  maybe even 50 at some point 
Tableau Software  Inc   NYSE DATA  is not looking so good as of late  After breaking the trendline and gapping down  it formed a wedge and broke down again  down another 2 99 to 94 17  or 3   on 2 5 million shares  It s at secondary support  If that breaks the support level  which is under 90  it may be headed down to the mid 70 s  Be careful with this one

4638,226153,APLO,4 Stocks To Watch  DECK  MAN  QLYS  UEIC,opinion,"It was kind of a difficult session on Wall Street on Monday  The markets are under pressure  and every rally is met with more selling  although they did make a bit of a stand on Monday  And it was an up day  so that s good  We re going to go over some shorts here  and be specific about some of the stocks that have more downside 
Deckers Outdoor Corp   NYSE DECK  has been ugly for a long time now  It spent months consolidating before the breakdown recently  and is now creating another bear wedge  The way the channel is created the first target is in the mid 50s  and the second target is in the high 40s 
ManpowerGroup Inc   NYSE MAN   coming off the top  really hard formed a rising wedge  It recently broke down and failed at the 50 day moving average  Look for this to move to the high 70s  and then the low 70s

World shares were green across the board after details from the Fed s minutes cast further doubt on the prospect of a rate rise this year  European stocks broke a one month high for their best weekly gain since late January on renewed hopes central banks will keep monetary policy loose for longer  Overnight  Asian equities and currencies also moved higher following yesterday s gains on Wall Street  the Dow ended above 17 000 for the first time since August  while the S P 500 closed well past its 50 day MA of 1 995  
Oil prices traded above  50 a barrel this morning  with a gain of nearly 9  this week  for the biggest weekly gain in 6 years 
Investors are now positioning themselves for corporate earnings season  which picks up steam next week with most of the nation s largest banks reporting their results  as well as big companies including  Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  and GE  NYSE GE   Earnings are expected to be down roughly 5 5 percent from a year ago  according to FactSet  mostly because of the drop in commodity prices  Now there is a game on Wall Street where analysts set the bar very low and then celebrate when a company stumbles over it  However  if the index reports a decline in earnings for Q3  it will mark the first back to back quarters of earnings declines since 2009  In other words  the last time we had consecutive quarters of negative earnings growth  the US economy was in a recession 
Yesterday the Fed published the minutes of the September FOMC meeting  most of the attention was on the policymakers  decision to leave interest rates unchanged for now  they re worried about global economies and inflation running below their target of 2   they think we are at or near full employment  Generally  the tone was dovish  The current Fed has talked about raising rates for about a year  Now we have the Fed saying future interest rate increases will be  data dependent   Also in the minutes  we saw economic projections and they are basically calling for 2  GDP growth  Slow  sluggish   get used to it 
Emerging market currencies have had a strong week  The Indonesian rupiah was the leader with a 9 2  gain against the dollar  followed by the Russian ruble  with a 7 3  gain  The Malaysian ringgit gained 6 4   and the Brazilian real was up 4 8   This does not mean emerging market currencies are in a bull market  for now  it s just a bounce 
If you follow all the data the Fed is looking at  you would stay quite busy  there are at least 30 economic reports that must be monitored in order to get a clue as to what the Fed s next move will be  The quick and easy monitor is the dollar index  because the greenback affects just about every tradeable market  inflation  manufacturing  exports  trade balance  jobs  and more   in one handy chart  The dollar index is just a hair under 95  It has traded from a high of 98 7 in August to a low of 92 5  also in August  
The dollar index has been in a downtrend since September 25  and this is why we have seen a bounce in oil  probably a greater cause than rig counts and demand  or Russia s moves in Syria   This is why the commodity indices have had a nice little rally in the month of October  Emerging markets currencies have been battered over the past year by the expectation that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates  but as the dollar has experienced a recent dip  the emerging currencies have bounced 
The trend lines on the dollar index suggest resistance around 97 5 and support  right about where we landed today  any further breakdown could see the dollar index testing the 92 5 lows  If we see a bounce  or even some sideways action here  then we look for the support and resistance trend lines to cross in the final week of the month  which is coincidentally  when the Fed FOMC holds its next meeting 
Today  New York Fed President William Dudley and Dennis Lockhart of the Atlanta Fed each said they expected a policy tightening in 2015 despite some recent red flags

Meanwhile  Congress faces another deadline to lift the debt limit on Nov  5  today John Boehner acknowledged that getting enough votes to pass a debt limit increase would be difficult  And another potential government shutdown threat looms in December when the current stop gap spending bill expires 
U S  import prices declined 0 1 percent  A surge in value of the U S  dollar last year  fueled by expectations a strengthening U S  economy would lead to higher interest rates  has been a factor pushing down inflation  evident by declines of non oil import prices  The smaller than expected decline in import prices might lay a bit of groundwork for an eventual interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve because a smaller downward push on inflation from imports could alleviate the Fed s concerns that inflation is too low 
In a separate report  the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0 1 percent in August  boosted by larger stocks of computers and professional equipment used by businesses  Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes  The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP   wholesale stocks excluding autos  rose 0 1 percent  At August s sales pace  it would take 1 31 months to clear shelves  An inventory to sales ratio that high usually means an unwanted inventory build up  which would require businesses to liquidate stocks  That  in turn  could weigh on manufacturing and economic growth

Apollo Education Group  NASDAQ APOL   the parent company of The University of Phoenix  has released information that the Department of Defense has suspended the university from recruiting military students  University of Phoenix  the largest for profit college in the US  has brought in  1 2 billion in GI Bill money since 2009 and received  20 million in tuition assistance from the Pentagon last year alone  That outsized share of the market  in addition to alleged predatory tactics at the school to lure in military personnel  resulted in an investigation into the school earlier this year  Though the order to stop military recruitment at the University of Phoenix is not yet permanent  it is likely a distressing development for the school  as well as the larger for profit college industry

4654,226169,APLO,What Investors Can Learn From Dan Price And The  Trophy  Generation,opinion,"We call it the  trophy  generation  Kids get something even if they don t deserve it   everything but a spanking 
But now those kids are growing up  They re running businesses  And  as we d expect  they re running those business with the same cavalier gimme gimme attitude 
They re failing 
In fact  they re failing so badly that it s comical 
You probably heard Dan Price s story  He made headlines in April when he announced everybody in his credit card processing company would make a minimum of  70 000 per year 
The kids of the trophy generation   many of them writing the stories about the news   gave him accolades  Attaboy  they said  Way to take from the rich and give to the poor 
Yep   
Then his plan failed in a spectacular way  Just as anybody with half an economic brain would predict 
Price now finds himself mired in a lawsuit filed by his business partners and  worse  his employees are unhappy  Several have left the firm for saner pastures 
The New York Times interviewed some of the folks who took their final paycheck from Price s firm  The comments would make Karl Marx blush 

  Price  gave raises to people who have the least skills and are the least equipped to do the job and the ones who were taking on the most didn t get much of a bump   said Maisey McMaste  who gave up a role as a financial manager 
Grant Morgan quit his job as a Web developer  despite a 22  raise   Now the people who were just clocking in and out were making the same as me   he said   It shackles high performers to less motivated team members  

There s a vital investing lesson in Morgan s quote 
People want to be paid for what they do    the unique talent they bring to the table  And they want to make more than somebody who offers less 
Capitalism treats the job market no differently from how it treats the stock market  The companies that provide something unique and useful will get treated better than those that don t 
Simple 
Apple  Nasdaq  NASDAQ AAPL  is the perfect example  It provides products that nearly half of us put in our pocket each day  It sells something truly useful and its shareholders have been aptly rewarded 
Apollo Education  NASDAQ APOL   on the other hand  is one of the worst performers of 2015  Shares are down over 62  this year  Why  Its customers no longer see the value of its products  A degree from one of its programs doesn t have the same value as a degree received elsewhere  Its product is not unique or useful    and the markets are valuing the stock accordingly 
But here s where we beg you to be cautious 
Just as Price tried to ignore the rules of economics  there are forces doing similar things throughout the stock market 
At the risk of sounding like a drum that plays just one beat    Yellen and her troops at the Fed are absolutely one of those forces 
As they pump their funny money into the economy  companies that don t have those unique or useful products are temporarily benefiting  They re getting loans to stay alive  They re getting capital simply because it has nowhere else to go 
In other words  they re getting a raise despite the fact they merely clock in at 9 and clock out at 5 
As that stimulus wanes  so will these firms 
It s simply the rule of the economy 
Perhaps that s why we like the markets as much as we do  Despite our culture s apparent need to put a trophy in every hand  the markets spit on the idea  Eventually  the winners win and the losers go home empty handed 
If we want to win our fight against mediocrity  we must first admit not everybody will hold a trophy above their head ",2015-08-10,Investment U,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-investors-can-learn-from-dan-price-and-the-“trophy""-generation-261061",261061

4710,226225,APLO,Vol Rises  Stock Hits New Low  Are For Profit Education Companies,opinion,Apollo Group  Inc   Apollo Group  is a private education provider  The Company offers educational programs and services both online and on campus at the undergraduate  master s and doctoral levels through its wholly owned subsidiaries  The University of Phoenix  Inc   University of Phoenix   Institute for Professional Development  IPD   The College for Financial Planning Institutes Corporation  CFFP   and Meritus University  Inc   Meritus  This is a vol and stock note in a name that has just breached a new 52 wk low while vol is climbing  While I focus on APOL  the trend seems to be similar for a number of companies within the for profit education industry  Ultimately  with the new Federal regulations  it s seems a fair question to ask   are these companies just not worth as much as they used to be  Let s start with the Charts Tab  six months   below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink   On the stock side  we can see the ugliness of a couple gaps down as well as a general down trend more recently  Here are some snippets from the two gaps I highlighted 2 28 2012 For profit educator Apollo Group  APOL  lowered enrollment and operating profit projections  citing an improving jobs market  competition from other educators and changes in its marketing and recruitment efforts  The operator of the University of Phoenix said it expects flat to low single digit new degree enrollment growth for the quarter ending Feb  29  below the previous expectations for 13   Factoring out this current quarter s extra day  new degree enrollment is seen decreasing in the low  to midsingle digits  vs  previous expectations of a midsingle digit increase  Its profit outlook for the August ending fiscal year sank  too  Apollo now expects operating profit between  625 million and  725 million  excluding one time items  vs  a previous forecast of between  655 million and  750 million  Analysts were predicting  746 million  Source  Investor s Business Daily via Yahoo  Finance    written by Kevin Harlin  And then in late March 3 27 2012 NEW YORK  AP     Shares of Apollo Group Inc  slid 6 percent premarket trading Tuesday after the for profit education company issued a dim forecast   The Phoenix company posted a second quarter profit of 51 cents per share late Monday  reversing a loss from a year earlier  Adjusted earnings per share of 58 cents beat the average analyst forecast by 20 cents  Revenue fell 7 5 percent as enrollments dropped 8 percent  but it still beat estimates   But Apollo expects new enrollment to turn negative in the third quarter and Citi Investment Research predicted that second half operating income will fall short of Street expectations   Like many for profit educators  Apollo has been dealing with the impact of new federal regulations on enrollment  Stricter government regulations enacted last summer prompted the companies to raise admissions standards  which has cut enrollments and profitability  Source  AP via Yahoo  Finance   So the stories are similar  business may be waning  It s the context of the decline that s a bit scary    this isn t necessarily just a bad time in the business cycle  but rather feels like a permanent paradigm shift in the way these companies can make money  Back to the stock decline  what s more interesting  to me  than the gaps down  is the new decline that started on 7 3 2012  The stock has gone from  36 62 down to  26 96  as of this writing  in about three weeks for a 26  drop  This drop feels scarier than the other two in that it s persistent and consecutive  The 52 wk range in stock price is   26 84   68 66   so the stock is right on its 52 wk low  Looking to the vol  we can see the rise in the implied of late  essentially in lock step with the dipping stock  Since 7 3 2012  the IV30  has risen from 32 45  to 54 48  as of this writing  for a 67 9  rise  In English  as the stock has dropped  25  in the last three weeks  the vol has risen  66    Let s turn to the Skew Tab to examine the month to month and line by line vols  Note that the red and yellow curves are the weekly options  We do see a beautifully normal skew shape across all four expiries  as well as a monotonic rise in vol from the back to the front  In English  the option market reflects elevated vol in the near term relative to the intermediate term  I do also note that the next earnings release should be after all four of those expiries  that s just a projection  Finally  let s turn to the Options Tab  for completeness Across the top we can see the vols are priced to 69 92   58 21   55 50  and 50 96   respectively for Jul27 W   Aug03 W   Aug and Sep In perusing the news it does appear that other for profit educators are struggling  see the recent release from DeVry  which is also now at a 52 wk low   Looking back to the news story at the top  it does seem like this industry as a whole is going through  has gone through  a substantial shift in the business model as dictated by changes in federal regulations  This downward move may be in fact new equilibrium points for the entire industry    these companies just might not be worth a much as they once were This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-07-27,Ophir

4759,226274,APLO,Walter Energy  A Distressed Opportunity ,opinion,"I m always looking for a big upside while trying to limit downside risk   Who isn t   Which is why I find global deep value and  distressed  plays so interesting 
These stocks are trading far down from their highs and oftentimes well below book or breakup value  This always prompts the question  How much worse could it get 
When it comes to this stock  the answer is much  much worse 
Trouble in the Coal Industry
In the last year  Walter Energy Inc  OTC WLTGQ  has gone from  6 84 to just  0 08 per share and from trading on the big board to the pink sheets  In July  it filed Chapter 11 to try to negotiate its way out of a mountain of debt exceeding  5 billion 
What a fall from grace for this proud Alabama company that was once a leader in metallurgical  
Walter Energy  known in the industry as Walt Coal  represents a stock and an industry that are both beaten down and ignored   in spite of the fact that coal provides 43  of America s electricity and 43  of the world s electricity 
Although the current Environmental Protection Agency would probably like coal to disappear  it s not going anywhere anytime soon 
Walter Energy specializes in metallurgical coal that s primarily sold to steel mills and used in the integrated steel mill process  The company sells to high growth steel markets in Asia  South America  and Europe and also produces thermal coal  anthracite  and metallurgical coke and coal bed methane gas 
Before its recent problems  Walter Energy employed approximately 3 500 employees and contractors with operations in the United States  Canada  and the United Kingdom 
Unfortunately  both the company and industry face challenges with supply and concerns over global manufacturing and industrial growth  This has led coal prices to drop sharply   with the benchmark price down 50  since 2012 
Other big challenges are weak demand in Asia and Europe  high labor costs  Obama s regulatory war on coal  and  265 million in debt service payments a year 
Struggling to Survive
The key question is this  Are we coming off a bottom in the coal cycle and  if we are  can Walter Energy survive long enough to get back in the game 
What might give the company some life 
Inside Coal reports that Walter Energy may be in talks about the potential sale of substantial assets  This is significant  since proceeds could be used to reduce debt   a key concern of analysts  The company recently refinanced some debt  lowering risk  but it remains significant 
On the other hand  if you can find catalysts to unlock the value or if the company becomes a buyout target  the upside gains can be extraordinary 
In particular  any uptick in Chinese industrial activity and imports of coal will help Walter s prospects enormously  Senior lenders such as KKR   Co LP  N KKR   Apollo Group Inc  O APOL   and Blackstone  N BX  are trying to restructure debt to avoid costly write offs that will hit earnings hard 
The company continues to try to sell assets at reasonable prices and is negotiating with the United Mine Workers to trim labor costs 
Walter Energy is an aggressive trading recommendation with near term prices closely tied to any signs that some sort of deal can be worked out 
For example  on October 16  it gained access to 30 days of cash to give the company some breathing room to strike a deal  This news sent the stock up 9 6  in one day 
It s an opportunity that s not for the faint of heart   that s for sure

Cerner Corporation  O CERN  is in a distinct down channel  It had a long up channel  which broke down  and is now making its way lower  with a down wedges  snapped back several times  and then rolled over again  It appears that the wedge is broken  On Monday  it had a breakaway gap  and on Tuesday  it had an inside day that could lead to lower levels  so the first target is around 52 3  and then down to 48 9

4762,226277,APLO,Stocks Battered Again  S P Eyes 22 Month Closing Low,opinion,"U S  stocks tumbled Monday afternoon  putting the S P 500 on track for its lowest close in 22 months  as a fresh drop in oil prices amid continuing fears of economic slowdown sparked a global flight into bonds and gold 
The Nasdaq Composite  3 21  logged the heaviest losses as the theme of a collapse in the so called FANG stocks   Facebook Inc  O FB    5 58  Amazon com Inc  O AMZN    4 62  Netflix Inc  O NFLX    0 70  and Google  O GOOGL  parent Alphabet Inc   2 26    continued for a second straight session 
The S P 500 SPX   2 57  tumbled 44 points  or 2 3   to 1 835  led by losses in the financial sector  If the index closes at that level  it would mark its lowest settlement since April 2014  The S P remains above its Jan  20 intraday low of 1812 29 
Energy stocks were also battered  Chesapeake Energy Corp  N CHK  plunged 36  and Williams Companies  N WMB    38 99  sank 25  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average   2 39  skidded 368 points  or 2 4   to 15 831  its lowest level since its Jan  20 closing low of 15 766 74 
Colin Cieszynski  chief market strategist at CMC Markets  said stocks falling below their Jan  20th lows  could indicate if we are really heading into a big bear market or nearing the end of a big correction within a bull market   A bear market is generally defined as a decline of at least 20  from a recent peak  while a correction is a 10  slide 
In particular  the S P s Jan  20 intraday low of 1812 29 is a  significant short term technical formation  after which there is  a downside pattern  that makes the chances of reversal much slimmer  said Frank Cappelleri  technical analyst at Instinet 
While stocks slumped  demand for so called haven assets surged  pushing gold prices GCJ6   3 52  to a nearly nine month high  and Treasury yields TMUBMUSD10Y   5 19  which move inversely to prices  to a 12 month low 
The Nasdaq Composite COMP   3 17  slumped 131 points  or 3   to 4 231  Facebook shares fell 5  Monday afternoon  while Twitter  N TWTR    4 55  tumbled 2 7   coming off an all time low touched earlier in the session  Alphabet was down 2 5  and Netflix was dipping in and out of negative territory 
 Is the market throwing out the baby with the bath water   said James Meyer  chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors  referring to the  rapid fall in prices for the highflying tech and biotech names that have been leading the market for the past 12 months  
The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund ETF N FDN   5 03  which includes a basket of some of the biggest publicly traded Internet companies  was down nearly 20  year to date 
 The former leaders of the previous bull cycle are the ones that get taken to the woodshed in the last phase of the downturn   Meyer said 
Financials were the worst performing sector on the S P 500  down 3 2   as ultralow interest rates and widening credit spreads have fueled concerns about banks  balance sheets  Financial giants Visa Inc  N V    6 28  and Goldman Sachs Group  N GS    7 05  were leading the Dow Industrials losses  down more than 6  
The banking sector selloff started in Europe  where the region s banking gauge  the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index FX7   5 59  has logged six straight weeks of declines  its longest weekly losing stretch since 2008 
But the sector is getting hit hard in the U S  as well  as investors realize that the Federal Reserve might have to hold off on the interest rate hikes that banks were anticipating to boost their balance sheets  said Sahak Manuelian  managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities  The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange traded fund N XLF   3 63  has tumbled 15  year to date 
As oil prices sank again amid continuing fears about the global oversupply of crude  the energy sector was hit  down 1  on the day 
Monday s losses came on the heels of the biggest weekly drop in a month for U S  equities  The Nasdaq Composite COMP   3 16  fell 3 3  on Friday and logged a 5 4  weekly drop  its biggest in a month 
Investors will be looking ahead to comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday and Thursday  when she testifies to Congress about the economy and monetary policy  Last week s jobs data prompted questions about the Fed s future interest rate policy  as Friday s data showed slower jobs growth  but decent wage inflation 
There is no data scheduled for Monday  nor any Fed speeches  The week will end with retail sales data

4784,226299,APLO,Consumer Stock Earnings Around The Corner  SYY  BUR  BRFH,opinion,The second quarter earnings season  or the quarter ended Jun 30  2016  is on its last leg  With almost 92 1  of S P 500 companies already having reported their quarterly results the overall earnings picture is becoming clearer Per the Zacks   the quarter saw a 3 7  decrease in earnings due to a 0 7  dip in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The Q2 2016 is the fifth quarter in a row to display a declining trend in earnings Nevertheless  we note a sequential improvement in earnings  Interestingly  this quarter is witnessing positive revenue growth and is currently reversing the trend displayed in the preceding quarter  Almost 71 1  of the companies surpassed earnings estimates  while 52 9  outpaced top line expectations in the second quarter The second quarter earnings season is critical for investors to ascertain the most attractive picks as the market has somewhat stabilized after Brexit  which shook the global economy in Jun 2016  Post Brexit  investors became jittery and have been resorting to safe haven stocks In this scenario  the consumer sector might be quite reliable  So far  the consumer sector has reported modest results this quarter As of Aug 10  2016  80 6  companies from the consumer staples sector enlisted in the S P 500 index have reported second quarter earnings  Out of these  72  of the companies have posted an earnings beat  while 52  surpassed revenue estimates  Leading firms from the industry like Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO    Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN

that delivered modest Q2 earnings despite currency headwinds and sluggishness in emerging markets In the consumer discretionary sector  94 3  of the companies have reported earnings  Out of these  87 9  topped earnings estimates and 52  surpassed revenue expectations  Consumer discretionary stocks like Apollo Education Group  Inc    NASDAQ APOL    Coach  Inc    NYSE COH    and The Walt Disney Company   NYSE DIS   reported decent Q2 earnings backed by higher revenues and margins  With the current earnings cycle drawing to a close  some more companies are scheduled to report their financial results this week  Let s take a look at how some of these companies might fare Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results before the opening bell on Aug 15  The  for Sysco is 0 00  and the company holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Though stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a higher chance on beating on earnings  the company s 0 00  Earnings ESP complicates surprise prediction Last quarter  this global food products maker and distributor posted a positive earnings surprise of 9 52   The company beat earnings estimates in two quarters and reported in line earnings in the remaining two with an average positive surprise of 6 65  in the last four quarters The company s strong business portfolio and strategic acquisitions have been driving growth  Encouragingly  Sysco delivered higher gross margins in the past one year period after witnessing declining gross margins in the last two fiscal years  The company s growth strategy seems to be paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are likely to have a favorable impact on its results in the to be reported quarter  However  Sysco expects food cost deflation and currency translation to adversely affect fiscal fourth quarter results  The company believes that deflation headwinds will persist in the fiscal fourth quarter as well  which will limit
